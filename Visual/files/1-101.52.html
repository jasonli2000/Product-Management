<td><pre>
The purpose of this file is to satisfy the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) requirement
for an electronic prescribing system to maintain an archive of all controlled 
substance prescriptions that were electronically entered.
 
The file will store all the information that is considered a part of the 
prescription.
 
The file should always be audited. In addition, the file should NEVER be
edited using FileMan. These are both DEA requirements.
 
In order to satisfy the requirement that both the prescribing (CPRS) and 
filling systems (Outpatient Pharmacy) create an archive, but to reduce the 
need for additional storage space, both CPRS and Pharmacy will use the same 
file. CPRS will create the entries when an order is signed or when a backdoor 
order message is received from Pharmacy. Once Pharmacy verifies the data in 
the Pharmacy system is an exact match for what CPRS stored, they will 
subscribe to the entry in the archive file and will update the PRESCRIPTION 
NUMBER (#1) field.
 
The file was defined in a different global name in order to handle the 
volume set from the rest of the CPRS system (i.e., the ORDER file).
It is important to note that to fully meet the DEA requirements, the fields 
required by the DEA cannot be pointers. We must store the data completely. 
The fields that are pointers are for our internal use, rather than for 
the DEA purposes.
