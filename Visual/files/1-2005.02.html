This file contains an entry for every type of object handled by the VistA
Imaging System. It is exported with data. All sites must have entries
for the data types distributed in order to display objects sent via
multimedia mail.
 The Object Type file handles objects of various types.  These include: 
  * still images 
  * image groups
  * graphics or waveforms
  * scanned documents
  * audio files  
 
 Other types are expected in the future (i.e., image overlays,
motion video chips, and office automation files).  An object,
such as an image series, may actually consist of multiple
objects.  In this case, the object type is Group.  The Object
Group multiple field is used to point to a set of objects in the
Image file.  Each object type has associated methods (software
routines) for performing certain actions.  For example, there are
methods for displaying images and image abstracts.  The group
type is used to combine multiple objects of the same or different
types to create complex objects.
 
 There are different image types, for example: 
  * black and white high-resolution x-rays
  * black and white ultrasound images (lower resolution)
  * pseudo-color nuclear medicine scans
  * medium resolution true color bronchoscopy images
  * pathology images
 
 Each type of object has a number of specific characteristics,
including the methods  required to display them.  For example,
each object type has a type name and an associated display method
or window.
 
 All accesses to objects use the file finder routine ^MAGFILE or
^MAGFILEA to find the network location needed.  Different entry
points of this routine will find locations of full files,
abstract files, and jukebox copies of files.  In addition, the
network write location will be returned for image captures.
