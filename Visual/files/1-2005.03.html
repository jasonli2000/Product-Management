The Imaging File (2005) has many "imaging multiples" pointing to it from
other packages such as Radiology, Medicine, Surgery, Mailman and the
various sub-files of Laboratory such as Surgical Pathology etc.  In order
to have a method of tracing back from the Image file to the parent file
multiple, a file was developed to aid in this process, along with some
additional fields in the Image file. Using these fields along with the
PARENT DATA FILE, backward navigation is possible whether it be to a
multiple of a file, or a multiple of a sub-file of a file. Each image that
is captured is associated with a procedure or test report.  Depending on
the service collecting the image, different types of reports will be
associated.  For example:
 
  * Medical Procedures:  Endoscopy, Dermatology, Hematology, Rheumatology, etc.
  * Anatomic Pathology:  Surgical Pathology, Cytology, Autopsy, Electron Microscopy
  * Radiology:  Xray, CT, MRI, Ultrasound
  * Surgery  Operation reports
  * Text Integration Utility  Progress notes
 
 In order to be able to display information from the associated
report, references to that report are stored in the Image file. 
One of these references is a pointer to the Parent Report file
(2005.03), which contains an entry for each package's report file
that is currently supported.
