This file holds data from modified image records of the Image file (2005)
and serves as an audit trail for modified images.  When image deletion takes
place, the image is deleted on the server if it is there, the Parent Report
file's pointer to the image file is deleted, the data from the Image file
is copied over to this file using the same IEN, and the node in the image
file is set to null as it can never be used again. The image residing on
the WORM drive cannot be deleted, so it can always be retrieved.
 This file stores the modified image record from the Image file
(2005) and serves as an audit trail for modified images.  When
image deletion takes place:
 
  * The image is deleted on the imaging server (if it is there).
  * The parent report file's pointer to the image file is deleted. 
  * The data from the image file is copied over to this file using the same IEN. 
  * The node is deleted from the image file.  
 The image residing on the WORM drive cannot be deleted, so it
can always be retrieved.  The field names and definitions are the
same as the Image file (#2005).
