 This file will contain an entry for every network storage location, as
well as MUSE (EKG) network location(s). This file maps logical device
names to physical device names, allowing continued operation even when
network storage devices are done. The Imaging site parameters has a number
of fields pointing to this file to locate where on the network different
files are written. Because the Imaging System operates in a distributed
environment, an object may be stored on one or more of the network storage
devices.  These include multiple magnetic file servers, one or more
optical jukeboxes, and possibly additional network devices accessed
through a gateway.
 
 Each logical location in the Network Location file is mapped to a
physical device.  Every physical device on the network that will be used
for objects must have at least one entry in the Network Location file.
 
 The Operational Status field allows rapid software reconfiguration in the
event of failure of one of the object storage devices.
 
 Each network storage device has a type, such as magnetic or optical.
This allows "automatic file migration," where an object resides on a fast
magnetic disk until 30 days since its last access, then it is moved to
slower, less expensive optical media.
 
 Three fields in the Image file (2005) are used to indicate the storage
device(s) on which the object resides.  For example, an object may
originally be captured to MAG1, the first magnetic server.  Within
seconds, an abstract is created and stored on this same device; the Disk &amp;
Vol, Abstract field will be set to MAG1 also.  Next, the Image file will
be copied to the optical jukebox (if present on the network), creating an
immediate backup copy.  The Disk &amp; Vol, Optical field will now be set to
point to the optical device used for the optical copy.
 
 The Network Location file was designed to allow access across a gateway.
This type of access has not been required at the test sites.
 
 We recommend using names for magnetic devices that begin with the three
letters, MAG, followed by sequential numbers.  We recommend that images be
stored in directories named IMAGE at the first level.  Do not store any
files in this directory that are not objects handled by File 2005.
 
 Logical names for Write Once Read Many (WORM) optical devices should
start with the four letters, WORM.
