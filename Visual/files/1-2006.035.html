The entries in this file each represent a file to be transmitted
to a remote location.
Entries are placed (automatically) into this file when images
are acquired, based on rules that are set up in a separate table.
Entries in this file are processed by a "background routing processor"
that takes care of the actual transmission of files to remote locations,
and also takes care of purging obsolete routed files from those locations.
Processed entries can be purged from this file using a menu option
on the menu of the "Routing Processor".
