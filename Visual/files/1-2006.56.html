The entries in this table contain the information about the various
studies that are recorded as tasks on the worklist for a DICOM "modality".
The top-level information in this table separates the activities from the
various clinics at a consolidated site; the next level contains the study
information.
 
This file contains temporary copies of information from the VistA
system that live on our satellite systems for the duration of the
study that produces the images, and the only reason for
replicating the information onto these "DICOM Gateway Stations"
is that we want to be able to allow the acquisition of images and
the presentation of "worklist information" to continue, even
while the VistA system is down, or when the DDP connection
between our Gateways and the VistA system is not operating. 
 
Information is copied from VistA to DICOM Gateway when an HL7
message is processed that announces the "exam", and removed when
an HL7 message is processed that announces that the exam is
carried out.
