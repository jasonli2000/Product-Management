This file contains information about studies
for which all images have been transmitted
to a VistA DICOM Gateway.
 
When all images for a study have been transmitted,
the study (or examination, or briefly, 'exam')
is called 'complete'.
 
The information that is collected for each study
consists of a flag that indicated whether or
not the exam is complete,
an accession number,
a patient ID as well as the patient's name,
and an unique identifier for the study (UID).
