The entries in this table describe image files that were received by the
DICOM Image Gateway, and could not be matched with a patient and an
ordered study.
 
The MAGD FIX DICOM FILE and MAGD FIX MEDICINE DICOM FILE menu options are
used to update the entries in this file.  The DICOM Image Gateway will
poll this file for corrected entries. The cross reference used to poll
this information is ^MAGD(2006.575,"AFX".
 
The routine L^MAGDLB1 is used by the above menu options and will loop thru
the following cross reference ^MAGD(2006.575,"F".  This cross reference is
set by the DICOM Study Instance UID; this is a unique number assigned by
modalities (imaging equipment) and is unique by case study.  So it is
possible to have over 20 entries in the file and only one unique "F" cross
reference.
