This is an Imaging file that temporarily stores image entries that have
been acquired on the DICOM gateways and do not have an associated
application parent report entry.  Imaging is a subscriber to the protocol
entry GMRC EVSEND OR (Consults event sent to OE/RR) and evaluates all HL7
message segments received from this protocol.  When an ORC message segment
is received for a signed result (signed TIU note) then a module is called
to lookup the entry in this file for possible matches and once found will
update the image entry in the Image file with it's associated parent
report and file the image pointer in the associated parent report.  The
matched entry is then deleted from this file.
