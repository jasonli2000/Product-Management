As a DICOM Gateway performs its various tasks, there are occasions
where error messages need to be transmitted to remote recipients
(FileMan users and/or mailgroups as well as SMTP mail recipients).
 
When such a message needs to be transmitted, a new entry is made
into this table, which will contain the message text and some
information about the message. Then an attempt is made to transmit
the message.
When the transmission is successful, the entry is removed from
this table.
 
When the transmission is not successful (which is likely since
many errors that need to be transmitted have to report some
type of "network failure") the text remains in this table while
the software on the DICOM Gateway can enter its further error
processing.
 
A supervisory task on the DICOM Gateway scans the content of
this table on a regular basis and will transmit any "left over"
messages.
As soon as a message has been transmitted successfully, its
entry in this table will be removed.
