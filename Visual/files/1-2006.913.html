An ordered list of strings that have meaning for the client software. 
Allows the client to retrieve artifacts in potentially nested groups 
defined by the client. Key List is only connected to the Artifact file (#2006.916) in 
a 0..1-to-many fashion. This approach allows the user of the Storage 
Service to store relational context of data hierarchies in the subsystem 
to enable intelligent searches by the user for groups of artifacts 
without hard coding the relationships between the affected artifacts in 
the Storage Service.
