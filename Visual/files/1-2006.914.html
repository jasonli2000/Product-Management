This file holds the various retention policies available 
to the storage subsystem. They come in two varieties: user-definable, and 
business.
 
User-definable retention policies can be created and mapped to artifact 
descriptors, to serve as intrinsic retention policies. They can be 
inactivated, or "logically deleted", but only if no artifact descriptors 
are pointing to them. They can never be physically deleted, since there 
are artifacts that still point to the old retention policies, and we need 
to keep the historical record of retention policies that have been 
applied to this artifact over time.
 
Business retention policies are designed to be called by business code 
for certain patients (e.g., Agent Orange retention policy, Employee 
retention policy, etc.). These retention policies will be installed with 
the patch and can be "replaced" with updated versions, but not deleted, 
since business logic will presumably expect to find them.
