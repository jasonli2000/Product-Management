This file contains a history of changes to key fields in the ED LOG 
file.  When a record is first created in the ED LOG file, and each time 
that record is updated, a record is also created in this file that
contains the values of the fields that actually changed.  This gives a
thorough history of what was changed when and by whom.  A major purpose to
the Emergency Department Tracking System is to measure how long it takes
to do things.  By keeping this history file, with all the time stamps, it
is possible to generate a variety of reports.  These include information
such as wait times, lengths of visit, number of delayed visits, etc.
 
The fields in this file correspond to the identically named fields in the 
ED LOG file (230).  For more detail in the field description, please 
refer to the matching field in the ED LOG file.
