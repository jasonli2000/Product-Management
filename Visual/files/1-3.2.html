<td><pre>
This file is pointed to by the Subtype field of the Device File.  This
file may hold vendor-specific code to characterize a terminal type.  For
example, escape sequences may be entered in the Open and Close Execute
fields to set pitch or font.  This file is also pointed to by the New
Person File to record sign-on subtype characteristics by user.
Data is distributed with this file to support screens handling capabilities.
This data will overwrite existing data for those terminal types of the
same name.  However, terminal types for printers will not be affected
since the data that is distributed is for a subset of known CRTs.
The Kernel Virgin Install distribution will seed a more complete
set of terminal types including those for printers as well as CRTs.
However, the Kernel Virgin Install should only be performed once
and only on a system where there is no pre-existing Kernel.
The data in this file is cross-referenced by name and synonym.
