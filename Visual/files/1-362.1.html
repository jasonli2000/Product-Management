<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
This file contains entries created by the Third Party automated biller.
As the auto biller attempts to create bills based on events in Claims
Tracking it sets entries in this file indicating the action taken by the
auto biller for the event.  The only way entries are added to this
file is by the auto biller, there is no user entry.
 
An entry may be created for the event if a bill could not be created, this
entry will contain a comment on why the bill could not be created.
If the Claims Tracking event could not be billed because the Earliest
Auto Bill date did not match the time frame set by the parameters, no
entry is made in this file but the events Earliest Auto Bill Date is 
reset.
An entry will be created for every event that a bill was created for, in
some cases these entries will have comments about the event that may be of
interest to billing the event.
 
Entries are deleted from this file in two ways.  Entries for events that
were billed are only deleted by the system, when the bill is either 
cancelled or authorized.  Entries without corresponding bills must be 
manually deleted by a user, with the option provided.
 
Per VHA Directive 10-93-142, this file definition should not be modified.
