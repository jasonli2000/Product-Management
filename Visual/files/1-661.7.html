This file implements the concept of 'First In First Out' (FIFO) stock
accounting.
 
Whenever stock items are brought into stock on a given date an entry will
be created for that date for the relevant HCPC item, location, vendor and
unit of measure. The date will include time to cater for the rare instance
where the same stock item with the same vendor, location and unit of
measure is brought into stock on the same day but with a different cost.
 
This file can then be used to look up locations containing the oldest
stock for any given HCPC item.
 
When items are removed from stock the associated vendor and location will
be identified by scanning a bar code (or manual entry in case of equipment
problems). The system will then assume that the oldest item for the vendor
and location has been issued and will reduce the stock quantity. If the
quantity becomes 0 or -ve the record will be deleted.
