This file contains data elements as specified by the Decision Support 
System (DSS) Program Office for the Laboratory extract from existing 
DHCP files. Entries into this file are made by extracting data by two 
different methods depending upon whether or not LMIP codes are used. 
Using LMIP codes, the data are extracted, in large part, from the WKLD 
LOG file (#64.03) which is populated by a routine provided by the 
Laboratory development team.  Not using LMIP codes, the data are derived 
from several Lab files as well as from several other DHCP files. Once 
approved by the DSS site manager, entries in this file are loaded into 
an electronic mail message and sent to the commercial vendor. This file 
is intended to be used for validation purposes only. Entries should be 
made only by the extract load routine.
  
Since validation techniques will be determined by the local site, it is
intended that the site add whatever cross references deemed necessary.
However, this file contains one nationally determined cross reference,
the "AC" cross reference on the EXTRACT NUMBER field (#2).  This cross
reference is used by the DSS Extracts software package as an essential
feature for managing and purging data in this file and should not be
modified.
  
This file should NOT be modified directly using VA FileMan.
