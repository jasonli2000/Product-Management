This file holds information needed to determine the DSS drug product
code for any entry in the local DRUG file (#50) which has been matched
to an entry in the NATIONAL DRUG file (#50.6).  The determining factors
are VA classification, route of administration, and, in some cases,
specific VA product name.  These factors have been determined by the
DSS pharmaceutical task force based, in part, on information provided
by the National Drug File (NDF) task force.  Use of this file depends
on fields in the local DRUG file (#50) which were set by the matching
process in the National Drug File package as specified by the NDF task
force.
 
For these reasons, it is imperative that neither the data nor the
data dictionary for this file be modified at the local VAMC.  As
modifications are required, they will be sent from the developers as
directed by the involved task force members.
