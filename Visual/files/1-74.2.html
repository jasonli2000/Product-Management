<td><pre>
This file provides the mechanism to group draft reports into logical
categories to help in the efficent processing of these reports.
 
Usually, an interpreting physician dictates a series of reports onto one
tape. The transcriptionist receives the tape and the patient folders
associated with the reports dictated on the tape. By placing the reports
for that tape in a single batch, usually by interpreting physician name,
the following processes will be improved:
 
         o re-printing the reports if the printer malfunctions.
         o verifying the report can be done by batch with the
           user only answering the 'report status' prompt for
           each report. The system automatically proceeds through
           the reports in the batch.
         o if more than one transcriptionist has to print his/her reports
           on the same printer then batch printing prevents
           interweaving of each transcriptionist's reports.
 
Naming of batches is controlled by the user and most often the name is the
name of the interpreting physician whose dictation the user is
transcribing. A user can only enter reports into a batch that he/she
created.
