<td><pre>
This file provides feedback from the sites regarding the content of the 
Lexicon.  This is done either by a user through a calling application
(user unresolved narratives) or by the calling application (application
unresolved narratives).  USER UNRESOLVED NARRATIVES occur when the user 
searches the Lexicon and fails to find a suitable expression in 
the Expression file (#757.01).  If the user select to use his/her original
text, then user's input is temporarily stored in this file.  However, for a
User Unresolved Narrative to be stored, the calling application must be 
defined in the Subset Definition file (757.2) and have the Unresolved 
Narrative flag set to 1.  APPLICATION UNRESOLVED NARRATIVE occur when an
application detects a problem with an expression in the Expression file 
(757.01).  The application can return the Internal Entry Number (IEN) of 
that expression along with a short comment stating the problem. Periodically
the entries in this file will be packed up into a mail message and sent 
to G.LEXICON@ISC-SLC.DOMAIN.EXT for consideration for possible inclusion
in the Lexicon.  After the mail message is sent the entries in this
file are deleted.  NOTE:  This file is exported without data.
