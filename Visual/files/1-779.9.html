<td><pre>
The Health Leven Seven (Optimized) software (HLO) was released as patch
HL*1.6*126 to the HL7 v1.6 software package.  Although it is structurally and 
functionally an independent system, it is officially part of HL7 1.6.  This is
a messaging system similar to the old HL7 1.6 package, but it was designed from
the ground up and is more robust, more capable, and supports a much higher
message throughput.  

This file contains the priorities of HLO queues as assigned by the system
operations staff. 

It is not necessary to assign a priority to a queue.  However, doing so
will change the frequency that HLO services the queue.  Important queues that
tend to be backed up should be assigned a higher priority.  Less important
queues may be assigned a lower priority.  The goal of setting queue priorities
is to balance the HLO resources over the queues in order to obtain a desired
performance.

Currently priorities may be set only for outgoing queues, though the file
was designed to also support the assignment of priorities for incomming queues.
The option for entering the type of queue (incomming or outgoing) currently
will automatically default to outgoing. A future enhancment may support
the ability to assign priorities to incomming queues.

To set the priority the name of the queue must be specified.  As explained, 
currently the queue will be assumed to be outgoing. Optionally,if the priority
is to be set only for a specific link then the link must be specified.

Examples:

You could set the priority of an outgoing queue named "HLO OUT" without
specifying the link.  The effect would be to set the priority of all outgoing
queues named "HLO OUT" regardless of the link.

You could set the priority of an outgoing queue named "HLO OUT" and also specify
the link.  The effect would be to set the priority of the outgoing
queue named "HLO OUT" that is sending messages via that specific link only.

If a queue's priority is specified to apply to all links, but that queue's
priority is also specified for a specific link, that specific priority setting
will override the general one.
