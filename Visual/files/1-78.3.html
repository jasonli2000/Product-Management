<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
This file contains the diagnostic codes that can be associated with an
exam.  The code is attached to an exam at the same time the interpreting
resident and/or staff physician is entered for the exam. The diagnostic
code represents a quick overall summary of what the interpreting physician
wrote in his/her report concerning the exam. [NOTE: Diagnostic code is not
the impression. The impression is stored in the 'IMPRESSION' field of the
'RAD/NUC MED REPORTS' file (#74).]
 
The following is the list of codes that are loaded when the
module is initialized:
 
         1) NORMAL
         2) MINOR ABNORMALITY
         3) MINOR ABNORMALITY, NO ATTN, NEEDED
         4) ABNORMALITY, ATTN. NEEDED
         5) MAJOR ABNORMALITY, PHYSICIAN AWARE
         6) UNDICTATED FILMS NOT RETURNED, 3 DAYS
         7) UNSATISFACTORY/INCOMPLETE EXAM
         8) POSSIBLE MALIGNANCY, FOLLOW-UP NEEDED
 
As part of the system customization process, these entries can be deleted.
However, once the system is in production, you should 'not' delete any
entries. Adding new entries is always allowed.
 
If the site decides to enter diagnostic codes for exams, then
database searches can be performed using the 'DIAGNOSTIC CODE'
field of the exam record in the search criteria. For example, the
database can be searched for all 'normal' chest procedures.
 
 Data Storage
 ------------
The data for the 'DIAGNOSTIC CODES' file is stored in the ^RA(78.3,
global. At the present time this file is very static after day-one
initialization is complete.  However, it still should be journaled.
It should also be translated if the operating system supports this function.
