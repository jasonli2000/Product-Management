<td><pre>
This file contains, for each imagaing location entry, parameters that the
module uses during various stages of exam and report processing and
inquiring.  The parameter switches allow the 'customizing' of the module
for each location by the package coordinator.
 
Within an imaging division there may be a number of physical locations
where a imaging procedure can be performed.  The module is designed to
handle multiple locations within a division.  However, each location can
only be associated with one division.
 
These parameters are loaded into the user's partition once the module
determines which division and location the user is currently
associated with.  This is determined by one of two ways: 1) the device
the user is using is an entry in the 'INPUT DEVICES' sub-file for
a location or 2) if (1) is not true than the module will simply
ask the user what his/her current location is.
 
Entries in this file should not be deleted.  Adding new entries is always
allowed.
 
 Data Storage
 ------------
The data for the 'IMAGING LOCATIONS' file is stored in the ^RA(79.1,
global. At the present time this file is very static after day-one
initialization is complete.  However, it still should be journaled.
It should also be translated if the operating system supports this function.
 
 Input Templates
 ---------------
The following is a list of input templates used by the package
and the entry in the OPTIONS file (#19) that uses the template:
 
                     Compiled
 Name                Routine      Description; Option(s)
 ----                -------     -----------------------
 RA LOCATION PARAMETERS          Used to enter/edit location parameters
                                 that are controlled by the package
                                 coordinator;
                                 RA SYSLOC
 
 RA SITE MANAGER                 Used to enter/edit location parameters
                                 that are controlled by IRM;
                                 RA DEVICE
 
If any modifications to these input templates are needed for local
purposes, then great care should be taken not to degrade any branching logic
in the template.

 The following is a list of print templates used by the package:
 
 Name                  Description; Option(s)

                       this file;
                       RA SYSLOCLIST
 
 RA EXAM ROOM LIST     Prints a list of cameras/equip/rms
                       and the locations
                       associated with the camera/equip/rm;
