<td><pre>
The ROR PATIENT file contains patient information
that is common for all local registries (mostly,
demographic information).
 
Most of the fields in the file have the same 
numbers and names as the corresponding fields in
the PATIENT file.
 
Demographic data from this file is compared to
that from the PATIENT file (#2) to determine if it
has been changed since the last registry data
extraction. These fields are updated with the
values from the PATIENT file and the UPDATE
DEMOGRAPHICS flag is set to "YES" in all active
registry records of the patient.
 
Records in the file have the same internal entry 
numbers as the patients' records in the PATIENT
file. The records are uniquely identified by
the internal value of the PATIENT NAME field.
 
A permanent screen (the ^DD(798.4,0,"SCR") node) 
restricts access to the records of this file. Only
users with the security key(s) for any defined
registry (or those with the ROR VA IRM security
key) can access records of the file.
 
If you want the changes in the security keys
allocation to have an effect immediately, you 
should rebuild the "ACL" cross-reference of the
.01 field of the SECURITY KEY multiple of the ROR
REGISTRY PARAMETERS file (#798.1). See the
description of the cross-reference for more
details.
