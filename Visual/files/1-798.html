<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
The ROR REGISTRY RECORD file contains records of
local registries. Each record associates a patient
with a registry and contains registry-specific and
additional service information (when the patient 
was added to the registry, if they were confirmed,
etc).
 
Records of the file are uniquely identified by 
the patient and the registry (the "A" primary key
and the uniqueness index "KEY" are used for that
purpose).
 
When the record of this file is deleted, the logic
of the ADELETE cross-reference tries to delete the
associated records from the ROR HIV RECORD 
(#799.4), ROR PATIENT (#798.4), and ROR PATIENT
EVENTS (#798.3) files.
 
A permanent screen (the ^DD(798,0,"SCR") node) 
restricts access to records of this file. Users
can only access records of those registries that
they have the security key(s) for. Users with the
ROR VA IRM security key can access all records of
the file.
 
If you want the changes in the security keys
allocation to have an effect immediately, you 
should rebuild the "ACL" cross-reference of the
.01 field of the SECURITY KEY multiple of the ROR
REGISTRY PARAMETERS file (#798.1). See the
description of the cross-reference for more
details.
