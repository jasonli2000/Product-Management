<td><pre>
National extract definitions were sent out with Clinical Reminders V.2.0 to
support site roll-up of reporting totals to the Austin Automation Center
(AAC).  The generic extract functionality supports corporate level management
analysis by providing reports that:
 
 - summarize patient reminder compliance totals (not applicable,
   applicable, due, not due)
 - summarize finding total counts that reflect the most recent findings
   resulting from reminder evaluation
 - summarize finding total counts that reflect site activities during the
   reporting month.  
 - list unique applicable patients included in the finding count (Patient
   List is not sent to Austin)
 
An extract definition may be manually run or set-up to automatically run
monthly or quarterly.  The extract can be defined to only produce compliance
totals, or to also include finding totals.
 
Each extract definition identifies:
 -  Which type of totals the extract will create: compliance, finding 
 -  What patient list(s) should be created first, second, third, , and
    what criteria should be used to build the patient list(s).
 -  For each patient list created when the extract is run, what reminders
    should be run.
 -  For each reminder run, what findings found should be used to include
    in finding count totals, based on the reminder status for each
    patient, and pre-defined counting groups.
 -  Counting groups are used to define findings that may have been found
    from reminder evaluation, as well as findings that may not be in the
    reminder but need to be counted for utilization counts.
 -  Counts are accumulated depending on whether the reminder status was
    applicable, not applicable, due or not due for the patient.
 -  Utilization counts count how many times the findings in a counting
    group were entered during the reporting period for the patients in
    the patient list.
 
The extract definition also identifies the last extract reporting period run
and the next reporting period to be run.  This information is used to support
managing extract runs.  The next reporting period is used by the next
automated run to know which period should be run.  
 
The reporting results are stored in the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY file (#811.3)
 
The national extract definitions are defined in this file to support generic
extract and roll-up needs by facility. The generic extract tools provide
options to:
 -  manage extract criteria 
 -  manage extract runs (manual and automated)
 -  manage transmissions to AAC
 -  view extract reporting results
 -  view the list of patients making up the patient denominator
 
When analyzing the results of an extract run, it is important to take note of
the following information before drawing conclusions:
 - list rule criteria used to create the target patient lists
   (denominators)
 - reminder definition used to create applicable, not applicable, due and
   not due compliance and finding totals
 - counting rules used to accumulate totals 
 - counting groups of findings and the type of totals accumulated (all
   patients, applicable, due or not due patients)
 
The following is a comparison of Reminder Due and Reminder Extract report
functionality: 
 
 Reminder Due reports:
 
   Use report criteria and pre-defined report templates with location/clinic
   stop, provider, and team lists to build the list of patients that will be 
   used to evaluate reminders.
   
   National Reminder Due report criteria and pre-defined report templates are 
   not nationally distributed.
 
   The Reminder Due report evaluates reminders and provides counts for Total
   patients, applicable patients and patients due.
 
   The patient with a Due status can be saved in a Reminder Patient List for
   further follow-up Patient Demographic and Health Summary reporting.
 
   The findings in the reminder are not used to accumulate counts.
 
   An existing Reminder Patient List can be used to identify target patients,
   instead of report criteria and report templates.
 
   The Reminder Due report can be created in a Summary or detailed report
   format, and is typically queued to run in a job during off-hours.
 
 National extract reports:
 
   Defines complex extract criteria into one extract definition that is
   pre-defined as a national Reminder Extract Definition.
 
   Pre-defined national extract criteria uses findings (reminder terms),
   independent of a reminder definition, to build one or more lists of
   patients that are used to evaluate one or more reminders.
 
   National extract criteria used to identify patients is similar to VA
   External Peer Review (EPRP) performance measure reporting criteria.  
   EPRP performance measures often require a current qualifying visit and
   an anchor visit during the previous year. Since some patients seen
   during a reporting month do not have a prior year anchor visit, the
   national extract's total patient counts for a given month will
   typically be less than the Reminder Due report's total patient counts
   for the same month.
 
   The lists of patients used for each reporting period's national
   extract are stored on the local system for sites to validate the
   patient denominator counts and provide local quality of care
   monitoring.
 
   Compliance total counts are accumulated based on the reminder status
   for each patient: total, applicable, not applicable, due, and not
   due.  The extract criteria used to create the totals is stored with 
   the total counts on the local system, as well as transmitted to the
   AAC.
 
   Finding total counts are accumulated for pre-defined national finding groups
   based on the findings found during reminder evaluation for the patient. The
   finding counts are totaled into categories that reflect the reminder status
   for each patient: total, applicable, not applicable, due and not due patient
   counts.  The finding counts are sent to the AAC with the extract criteria 
   used to create the counts.
 
   Utilization counts are accumulated for pre-defined national finding groups
   that count how many times specified findings were entered during the 
   reporting period for patients for each patient denominator.  The finding 
   counts are sent to the AAC with the extract criteria used to create the 
   counts.
 
   Each patient that had a finding count is stored on the local system for
   follow-up patient care and validation of reporting results. The patients are
   not sent to the AAC.
 
   The national extract tools use Mailman links with the HL7 interface to send
   compliance totals and finding totals for each monthly period to the AAC. AAC
   adds the national monthly reporting to the Compliance Totals National 
   Database stored at the AAC.
 
   The national extract reports are generated by a job. IRM Staff can help set
   up each type of extract definition to automatically reschedule itself to run
   monthly at each site. The extract run needs to occur prior to the tenth of
   each month. 
 
   The sites can manually rerun an extract and/or selectively retransmit an
   extract to AAC in the event of a failed transmission. The Extract Summary
   reports may be used to verify compliance totals.  
 
   Parties interested in viewing the AAC Compliance Totals National Database
   may be granted read-only access to this data.  The AAC uses the
   national database to create Simple Authentication and Security (SAS)
   files with read-only access.
 
File relationships:
 
   The extract definition uses list rules (#810.4) to build lists of patients.
   If the extract definition is for Compliance and Finding Totals, the extract
   definition will be defined with counting rules (#810.7). The counting rules
   will be defined based on counting groups (#810.8). 
 
   Data from the extract is stored in the extract summary file (#810.3) and 
   patient lists are saved in the patient list file (#810.5). HL7 messages 
   containing the extract data from the extract summary (#810.3) are passed
   to the HL7 package for transmission to the AAC. Individual patient
   level data is not sent to Austin. However, a list of patients with
   particular findings may be stored in the extract summary file (#810.3)
   for validation of patients.
 
Nationally distributed definitions are prefixed 'VA-' and cannot be modified 
by site.  
 
Sites should name locally created extract definitions according to their local 
naming convention.
