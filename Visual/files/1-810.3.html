<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
This file stores compliance totals found for a specific extract.  The extract 
Entries are read only and may be selected by number or extract name. 
The extract Summary entries are currently created from two types of
processing:
1) Generic EXTRACT tool manual runs and automated runs
2) LREPI ENHANCE MANUAL RUN and LREPI NIGHTLY TASK on day 15 of each month

Generic extract summary entries:

The REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY NAME is the combination of a unique abbreviation.
When the extract is created from the EXTRACT manual and automated options, the
REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY NAME will include Q, M, or Y (for quarterly, monthly,
or yearly), nn for month or quarter, and yyyy for year. The following is an
example of extract names:
     VA-IHD QUERI 2006 M2     
     VA-IHD QUERI 2006 M1    
     VA-IHD QUERI 2005 M12     

National extract summary entries created from generic Reminder Extract
functionality (not LREPI) are stored with a VA- prefixed name.  Each extract
entry contains reminder compliance totals for each unique combination of
patient list and reminder.  The extract will optionally store finding
compliance totals if the TYPE OF TOTALS for the extract is "Compliance and
Finding Totals". No patient specific data is stored in the extract summary
file for generic extracts.  The patient lists (denominators) used to create
the extract summary totals, for a particular reporting period, are available
from Reminder Patient List options.  

Generic extract summary entries will default to be purged after 5 years.  The
automated purge status can be changed for a particular extract summary entry
to retain the entry indefinitely.  

LREPI extract summary entries:

The LREPI extract names use YY/MM representing the ending year and
month of the extract date range, and the run date in the format YYMMDD. The
date and time of the run is an identifier.  The following is an example of
LREPI extract names.
    LREPI 00/05 061500     
    LREPI 00/06 073100     
    LREPI 00/07 081500   

The LREPI extract entries assume all results are for the primary institution,
and includes patient specific data with findings.  The LREPI extracts created
are based on LREPI reporting criteria which is not available for generic
reporting functionality.    This file will maintain up to 36 extract entries
for each type of extract.  After 36 entries, when a new entry is added, the
oldest entry is deleted from the file.  Sites are asked to run the LREPI
ENHANCE MANUAL RUN for months starting from 10/01/98 through 8/31/00. This will
seed the Emerging Pathogens Initiative (EPI) database with risk assessment
data.  Subsequent updates to the EPI database will automatically occur monthly
via the LREPI NIGHTLY TASK option. Sites will have up to 36 months of extracts.
This may be fewer than 36 months if the site runs extracts for the same month
more than once.  Multiple extracts for the same month occur when the site runs
the LREPI ENHANCE MANUAL RUN for a month to fix errors found by the receiving
national database.  For LREPI runs, the receiving national database is the
Emerging Pathogens Initiative (EPI) at the Austin  Automation Center (AAC).  
 
An LREPI entry in the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY file contains information that 
identifies the extract entry, the extract findings, and totals by finding item. 
The extract entry information includes the number, extract name, beginning and
ending extract dates, person who ran the extract option, task number, total
patients evaluated and total patients with findings.  The extract findings
include a number (for ease of selecting a finding item), patient, reminder
term, value, alternate id, finding date, related visit (if PCE data), encounter
type (I/O), result, value, drug and DSUP (days supply).  These extract finding
fields are returned by the reminder evaluation logic.  The result, value, and
drug are all free text fields without specific input and output transforms
because the data comes from the source VistA data it came from, with read only
access on this file.  The alternate id is specific to the LREPI extracts.  A
number value in the alternate id field indicates that the finding is for
Hepatitis C risk assessment.  The alternate id will be used for statistical
purposes in the EPI database.     
 
The flow of LREPI processing is as follows: 1) LREPI gathers Lab Search/Extract
patients and findings 2) LREPI gets all patients and findings from a reminder
extract evaluation process given the extract date range and reminder list. 
(The reminder list is from a new LREPI file 69.51).  2.1) The reminder extract
evaluation logic uses medications mapped to reminder terms in the VA-NATIONAL
EPI RX EXTRACT reminder, and the extract date range, to call new inpatient
pharmacy and outpatient pharmacy extract logic to get patient pharmacy
findings.  2.2) The reminder extract evaluation uses the remaining reminder
criteria to build a list of patients with findings from the following files in
the extract period: 
  LAB DATA           (#63) 
  V POV              (#9000010.07) 
  V HEALTH FACTORS   (#9000010.23) 
  V PATIENT ED       (#9000010.16) 
  V EXAM             (#9000010.13) 
2.3) The list of patients is used to evaluate the VA-HEP C RISK ASSESSMENT and
VA-NATIONAL EPI LAB EXTRACT reminders.  The findings within the extract date
range are added as Extract Findings in the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY file and
then returned to the Lab Search/Extract process.  3) The Lab Search/Extract
process uses the final list of patients and findings to create HL7 messages. 
Each reminder finding for a patient is used to create a DSP segment.  Pharmacy
findings contain both a DSP and ZXE segment.  4) When the AAC processes the
messages, error messages are returned for each message with the SSN related to
the erroneous data. Note: Messages with errors are not added to the EPI
database.  When erroneous data is  fixed at the site, the LREPI ENHANCE MANUAL
RUN is run for the month with the error to transmit the entire month's data
again.  The new data for each patient and finding date  replaces the old
patient and finding date's data.  5) Two new options are available on the
REMINDER REPORTS menu that provide total counts by finding item, as well as a
detailed list by finding item and SSN.  6) Sites are encouraged to provide
FileMan read-only access to the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY file (810.3) for those
who validate the extract data, the Hepatitis C implementation team, and
Hepatitis C Coordinators responsible for monitoring Hepatitis C activities at
each site.
