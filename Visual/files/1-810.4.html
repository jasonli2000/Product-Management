<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
This file is used to define what extract criteria should be used to build
reminder patient lists. Extract criteria is defined as "list rules" in this
file. The file is used by the Reminder Patient List option and Reminder
Extract Management option to create patient lists. 
 
There are four types of rule criteria in the List Rule file: 
 
  Patient List - defines an existing patient list 
  Finding Rule  - defines reminder terms that specify findings 
                  and the date ranges to use
  Reminder Rule - defines a reminder definition that builds a patient list
                  based on the patient cohort logic using the ending date as
                  the evaluation date. 
  Rule Set      - defines a multiple of sequentially defined list rules 
                  (a rule set can not be included in the multiple). 

The rule criteria are combined into a Rule Set that defines how to use the
criteria to create or modify a patient list. Rule Sets allow lists of patients
to be manipulated when a patient meets specified criteria by the following
operations: 
 
  ADD     to a new or existing patient list 
  REMOVE   from an existing list 
  SELECT   retain a patient in an existing list if the patient meets the 
           criteria, and remove the patient if the patient does not meet 
           the criteria. 
  
A rule set can contain multiple operations. One operation can be defined for
each sequence in the rule set.  
 
Nationally distributed list rules are prefixed with 'VA-' and cannot be
modified by sites.  

FINDING RULES and Date Ranges:
------------------------------------------------------------
A Date Range is used by FINDING RULES to search for findings.
List build processing determines which Beginning Date/time and Ending Date/time
to use when evaluating each finding based on where the date/times are defined.
Beginning Date/Time (BDT) and Ending Date/Time (EDT) fields can be defined at
multiple levels:

1  List Build action BDT and EDT: default when not defined at lower level
  2  Rule Set Sequence BDT and EDT: overrides previous level
    3  List Rule BDT and EDT: overrides previous levels
      4  Term Finding BDT and EDT: overrides previous levels

This override relationship can be defined with the following equation, where
"&lt;" should be interpreted as "is overridden by":

List Build &lt; rule set sequence &lt; list rule &lt; term's finding

List Build and date range evaluation:
------------------------------------

The List Build BDT and EDT are specified by the user selecting the List Build
action. The List Build BDT and EDT is the default date range when the BDT and
EDT are not defined for the rule set sequence, list rule, or term finding. The
default date range is used to find a match on each finding in the criteria. 

If no date range limits should be used to find a match on finding, either the
rule set sequence or list rule needs to be defined with a zero in the BDT or
EDT fields, or both. A zero in the BDT field means start with the patient's
oldest data. A zero in the EDT field represents the end of the day on the day
the list is built. Note: This is in contrast to Reminder Definitions, where the
BDT and EDT for a finding are left blank to specify no limits. In the REMINDER
LIST RULE file, if zero is defined in the BDT, and the EDT is left blank, the
list build tools will assume both BDT and EDT should not have date range
limits, and vice versa if EDT has the 0 and the BDT is blank. 

The use of "T" in the BDT or EDT fields always represents the List Build ending
date/time specified for the list build action or the extract reporting period,
depending on whether a reminder patient list or extract option is being used to
build the list.

"BDT" may also be used in the BDT or EDT fields and represents the starting
date/time specified for the list build process or the extract reporting period.
BDT-5Y creates a date five years prior to the beginning date/time. 

If the ending date/time is earlier than the beginning date/time, then no
finding matches will be found.

REMINDER RULES and Date Ranges:
------------------------------------------------------------
Reminder Rules do not use the Beginning Date/time from the List Build, List
Rule Sequence or Reminder Rule Beginning Date/time fields. Reminder evaluation
using date ranges is based on existing reminder definitions. However, a
Reminder Rule will use the Ending Date/time (EDT) from the Reminder Rule, List
Rule Sequence, or List Build EDT. The same EDT overrides that are used for
Finding Rule EDT are also used for Reminder Rule. The EDT used for reminder
evaluation can be defined at multiple levels:
1  List Build action EDT: default when not defined at lower level
  2  Rule Set Sequence EDT: overrides previous level
    3  List Rule EDT: overrides previous levels
      4  Reminder evaluation is not impacted by terms in the reminder
         definition.
