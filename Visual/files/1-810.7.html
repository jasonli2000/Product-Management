This file is used during extract processing when an extract definition's TYPE
OF TOTALS field is defined with COMPLIANCE AND FINDING TOTALS. When the
extract type is for COMPLIANCE TOTALS only, there will not be an extract
counting rule defined in the REMINDER EXTRACT DEFINITION file (#810.2). When
the extract type includes FINDING TOTALS, then the extract definition needs to
reference a counting rule for each reminder processed by the extract. 

In the Extract definition, there is a basic hierarchy as follows
Extract general information
   Patient List to build and list rules to build them
      Reminders to be run with the Patient List
         Extract Counting Rules that define how to count findings 

An entry in the REMINDER EXTRACT COUNTING RULE file identifies how groups of
findings should be accumulated based on the reminder status.
Each group of findings is defined as a counting group in the REMINDER EXTRACT
COUNTING GROUP file (#810.8).

One counting group can be referenced multiple times in a particular counting
rule to collect counts in multiple ways. The unique combination of a counting
group and a Reminder Status field is what makes the counts different. The
Reminder Status field is the status associated with the patient when the
reminder was evaluated. Each patient is always in the TOTAL PATIENTS count,
but the patient is included in the APPLICABLE PATIENTS, DUE PATIENTS, or NOT
DUE PATIENTS counts depending on the reminder status for each patient. 

For example: A counting group defined with possible LDL value ranges, can be
defined to get multiple counts, depending on the patient's REMINDER STATUS.
When TOTAL PATIENTS Reminder Status is defined with the counting group: Every
patient in the patient list is used to find a match on the findings in the
group. If a finding match is found, a count is accumulated into columns based
on the reminder status of APPLICABLE, NOT APPLICABLE, DUE or NOT DUE. 

When APPLICABLE PATIENTS Reminder Status is defined with the counting group:
Patients from the patient list, where the reminder was applicable, are used to
find a match on the findings in the group. If a finding match is found, a count
is accumulated into columns for each finding in the group based on the reminder
status of APPLICABLE, NOT APPLICABLE, DUE or NOT DUE. Applicable patients
should have 0 counts in the NOT APPLICABLE count for each finding.
 
When DUE PATIENTS Reminder Status is defined with the counting group: Patients
from the patient list, where the reminder was due are used to find a match on
the findings in the group. If a finding match is found, a count is accumulated
into columns for each finding in the group based on the reminder status of
APPLICABLE, NOT APPLICABLE, DUE or NOT DUE. Due patients should have 0 counts
in the NOT APPLICABLE and NOT DUE count for each finding.

When NOT DUE PATIENTS Reminder Status is defined with the counting group:
Patients from the patient list, where the reminder was not due are used to find
a match on the findings in the group. If a finding match is found, a count is
accumulated into columns for each finding in the group based on the reminder
status of APPLICABLE, NOT APPLICABLE, DUE or NOT DUE. Due patients should have
0 counts in the NOT APPLICABLE and DUE count for each finding.

The accumulated counts for each finding are stored in the REMINDER EXTRACT
SUMMARY file (#810.3). The sequence number in the file determines the order
the counts will be accumulated for, saved to, and displayed from the REMINDER
EXTRACT SUMMARY file (#810.3). 
The counts can be used to make comparisons between TOTAL PATIENTS, APPLICABLE
PATIENTS, DUE PATIENTS, and NOT DUE PATIENTS counts.  
       
If no counting groups are defined in the extract counting rule, then no finding
totals will be accumulated. 
Nationally distributed extract counting rules are prefixed 'VA-' and cannot be
modified by sites. 

Sites should name locally created extract counting rules according to their 
local naming convention.
