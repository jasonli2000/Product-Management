This file defines Clinical Reminder terms. Terms have a number of uses,
including as findings in a reminder definition, as finding rules for
building patient lists, and as elements of extract finding groups.
 
This file contains a combination of national, local, and VISN level
terms. Nationally distributed entries will have a CLASS of "National"
and the name is prefixed with "VA-". Any terms created at your site
should have a CLASS of "Local". Terms created for VISN use will have a
CLASS of "VISN"

Before a term can be used, it must have findings mapped to it. The
findings that can be mapped to a term are any of the standard
Clinical Reminder findings with the exception of terms.

Reminder terms are useful for national reminders involving findings
that are based on local file definitions (e.g., laboratory test, drug
file, radiology). National reminder terms have limited editing
capabilities, which allow sites to map their local finding items to a
term. Sites may create local reminder terms, providing an easy way to
group a variety of findings and treat them the same way in a reminder.
 
When a reminder with terms is evaluated, the finding items mapped to
the term are used to find the patient data, but the patient data is
reported based on the term the data is mapped to.
