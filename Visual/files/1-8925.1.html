This file stores Document Definitions, which identify and define behavior
for documents stored in the TIU DOCUMENTS FILE (#8925).  For consistency
with the V-file schema, it may be viewed as the "Attribute Dictionary" for
the Text Integration Utilities.
 
It also stores Objects, which can be embedded in a Document Definition's
Boilerplate Text (Overprint). Objects contain M code which gets a piece of
data and inserts it in the document's Boilerplate Text when a document is
entered.
 
Warning: objects embedded in boilerplate text are looked up by multiple
index (i.e. DIC(0) contains 'M'). Current code (see routine CHECK^TIUFLF3)
checks all present indexes to make sure object names, abbreviations and
print names are not ambiguous for this lookup. If new indexes are added,
this code MUST BE UPDATED to check the new index as well.
 
Some entries in this file are developed Nationally and exported across the
country.  Others are created by local sites.  Entries in the first
category are marked National Standard and are not editable by sites.
 
This file does NOT allow multiple entries OF THE SAME TYPE with the same
name.  That is, within a given Type, there are no duplicate names. (This
refers to the .01 field, the Technical name of the entry.)
 
This file does not allow a parent to have items with the same name, even
if the items have different internal file numbers (i.e. are different file
entries).  Again, this refers to the .01 Technical name of the entry.
 
Because of ownership considerations, the file does NOT allow an entry to
be an item under more than 1 parent.  If the same item is desired under
more than 1 parent, the item must be copied into a new entry.  There is
one exception:  Document Definitions of Type Component which have been
marked Shared may have more than one parent.
 
The Document Definition Utility TIUF categorizes certain fields as Basic,
Technical, or Upload, and displays these fields together as a group when
user edits or views a Document Definition. BASIC fields include Name,
Abbreviation, Print Name, Type, Personal Owner, Class Owner, Status, In
Use, Shared, Orphan, Has Boiltxt, National Standard, OK to Distribute, and
Suppress Visit Selection. TECHNICAL fields include Entry Action, Exit
Action, Edit Template, Print Method, Print Form Header, Print Form Number,
Print Group, Allow Custom Form Headers, Visit Linkage Method, Validation
Method, and Object Method. UPLOAD fields include Upload Target File, Laygo
Allowed, Target Text Field Subscript, Upload Look-up Method, Upload
Post-Filing Code, Upload Filing Error Code, and multiples Upload Captioned
ASCII Header and Upload Delimited ASCII Header.
 
The Document Definition file contains extensive, detailed field
descriptions. Likewise, some protocols (File 101) used in TIU have
extensive and careful descriptions in the Protocol file. Many of these
descriptions are used in TIU for online help. If it becomes necessary for
a national programmer to edit these descriptions, the programmer should
check to make sure all online help is still displayed properly.
 
Users are expected to use the Document Definition Utility TIUF to enter,
edit, and delete file entries.  In fact, the file prohibits the deletion
of entries through generic Fileman Options.  It also prohibits the edit
through generic Fileman of a few critical fields: Type, Status, Shared,
and National Standard.  Adding and Deleting (but not editing) Items is
also prohibited through generic Fileman options.  Abbreviation and Print
Name of OBJECTS cannot be edited through generic Fileman Options.
 
This does NOT imply that it is SAFE to use generic Fileman to edit other
fields.  Users are cautioned that edit through generic Fileman bypasses
many safeguards built in to the Document Definition Utility and can create
havoc unless the user THOROUGHLY UNDERSTANDS the File and its uses.
 
If users find needs which are not met through TIUF, please communicate
them to the TIU development team.
                           
                               *****************
 
WARNING: Using generic Fileman options to edit entries can cause SERIOUS
database problems.
