This file associates users with actions on documents.
 
Actions are of 2 kinds: authorization actions such as the signature action,
which an associated user is authorized to perform, and subscription
actions, such as an unsigned document notification, which the associated
user "signs up to receive."
 
An action may be associated with a USER CLASS in the User Class file
(e.g. Staff Physician class) AND/OR with a USER ROLE in relation to the
document (e.g. author of document).
 
If an Authorization/Subscription entry has both User Class AND User Role,
the AND FLAG field permits these requirements to be "AND'ed", that is, a
user must both belong to the User Class AND must fill the User Role in
order to perform the action.  If the AND FLAG has value OR, or has no
value, then User Class and User Role within the same entry are "OR'ed".
 
Each file entry associates an action with 1 user class and/or 1 role.  The
entry makes this association for a given Document Definition (e.g.
Progress Note) of a given status (e.g. Unsigned).
 
Multiple file entries for the SAME action/Document Definition/document
status allow association with more than one user class/role.  Such entries
are "OR'ed":  that is, if a user belongs to the user class/role of one OR
another of these entries, the user may perform the action.
 
User classes automatically INCLUDE user subclasses of the given class as
defined in the User Class file.
 
Document Definitions exist in hierarchy in file 8925.1, with Classes at
the top level, Document Classes at the next level down, and Titles under
Document Classes.  Authorization/Subscription entries may be defined at
any of the above levels.  For example, an authorization which applies to
most or all Progress Notes should be defined at the Class level for
Document Definition "Progress Note."  On the other hand, an authorization
which applies only to Progress Notes of Title "Dental Hygiene Note" should
be defined at the Title level for Document Definition "Dental Hygiene
Note".
 
When using authorizations/subscriptions to determine whether a given
user should receive/may perform a given action for a Document Definition
of a given Title, code begins by checking entries for that action and
status FOR THAT TITLE.  If ANY such entries exist, then entries for higher
Document Definition levels will be ignored, and the user passes/fails
based on that level alone.  Thus, if a Title is linked with a certain
action, status and user class, then rules for that Title, action, and
status should be entered for ALL user classes which can perform the
action on the Title, since broader authorization (e.g. Provider class)
set at higher levels (e.g. Progress Notes) is ignored.
 
If such entries do NOT exist, the next higher level of Document Definition
is checked.  And so on.
 
If no entries are found on any level, no users can perform/subscribe to
the action for the given Document Definition and status.
