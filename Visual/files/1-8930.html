This file is intended to allow the definition of user classes in such a
way that they are useful across packages.  It will undoubtedly evolve with
more experience in this area.
 
These user classes are then used to support part of the the
"authorization" concept - who may do what to a document, order, etc.
 
They are also used to support part of the "subscription" concept - who
should receive something, e.g. a notification that a document needs
signature.
 
The User Authorization/Subscription file points to the User Class file to
allocate authorizations/subscriptions to appropriate user classes.
 
The User Class Membership file links users in the New Person file to User
Classes.
 
This file supports an infinite hierarchy of subclasses, with each entry
having as many subclasses as desired.  Subclasses are contained in the
same file, as entries in their own right.  A class automatically contains
as members all members of its subclasses, as well as explicit members of
the class itself.
