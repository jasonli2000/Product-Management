This file is used to track the content and interactions with an alert.
Every alert which is generated is initially filed within this file.  Each
entry has the date and time the alert was generated, which user generated
the alert, whether the alert was generated in a background task, what
action was to be taken if any (the entry point or option name to be used)
and the data string, if any, for use with the alert.  There is a multiple
field which also identifies each user that the alert was sent to, and when
the user initially saw the displayed text, when the alert was selected for
processing, when the processing was completed, and when the alert was
deleted after processing or associated with another user's processing, or
when the alert was deleted by a clean-up operation.
 
Unless a longer lifetime is specified for the specific alert, it will be
deleted from the file after 30 days.  If a longer lifetime is specified,
it will not be deleted until after that period passes.
