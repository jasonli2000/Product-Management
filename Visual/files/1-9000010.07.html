This file has been designed for joint use by the Indian Health Service and
the Department of Veteran Affairs.  POV is an abbreviation for "Purpose of
Visit" (descriptive name used by IHS) or "Problem of Visit" (descriptive
name used by VA).
 
The V POV file is used to store clinical data related to the "purpose of
visit" or "problem of visit", (POV). This is the provider's definition of
what diagnosis to use to represent the patient care given at the visit.
The POV entry is not the patient's "Chief Complaint" text.  It is the
diagnosis as defined by the provider which will have an ICD Diagnosis
code related to it to support Clinical needs and additionally support
Administrative functions too such as Billing, Workload, and DSS.  
 
There should be at least one "purpose of visit" (descriptive name used by
IHS) or one "problem of visit" (descriptive name used by the VA) in the V
POV file for each patient visit whether it is an inpatient, outpatient or
field visit, and regardless of the discipline of the provider (i.e.
dental, CHN, mental health, etc.). There is no limit to the number of
POV's that can be entered for a patient for a given encounter.
  
At IHS facilities, POV's are generated automatically for this file at
time of discharge from the Admission, Discharge and Transfer (ADT) system.
POV's are entered in narrative form, and coded automatically to the 
appropriate ICD9 code. Physician entered narrative which modifies the
diagnosis, such as "doubtful, suspect, resolved" are entered by the data
entry person in the MODIFIER field.  Narrative qualifiers, such as "not
healing well", "date of onset", "severe" etc.. are stored in the NARRATIVE
QUALIFIER field.  STAGE is used only as a local option.  The file contains
pointers to the IHS Patient file, and visit file, and data must exist in
both of these files for this visit before a POV can be entered here.
 
At VA facilities, POV is used as an abbreviation for "Problem of Visit",
or the problem treated at the visit.  POV's are primarily created
for clinic visits from 3 sources:
  1) The scheduling checkout process, in which case the information
collected about the POV is limited to the ICD Diagnosis code.  The
provider narrative becomes the ICD narrative from the ICD Diagnosis file.
  2) The Encounter Form automated data scanning (AICS package).  In this
case the provider narrative is the terminology defined by the clinician to
represent the diagnosis on the encounter form. The AICS package, or other
automated data capture tool, is able to pass the narrative and the ICD
Diagnosis.  If the problem treated at the visit was a pre-existing problem
from the patient's "Problem List", the related problem entry is also
stored in the POV record. (The Problem List orientation is not utilized by
IHS.)
  3) The manual data entry process for encounter form data not collected
via automated data capture.  This process is the most like the process IHS
