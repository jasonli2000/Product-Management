<td><pre>
The V CPT file has been defined for joint use by the Indian Health Service
and the Department of Veteran Affairs. This is the file used to store CPT
related services performed at a visit.  Data must exist for a patient and
a visit before data can be entered in the V CPT file.
 
This file is used in the VA to identify procedures that were done to a
patient at an encounter or occassion of service.  The procedures may
have been performed by a primary or secondary provider of patient
care.  Procedures checked off and scanned from ambulatory care encounter
forms are stored here to record that they were done.  Results of
procedures are not included.
 
This file is restricted to procedures that have a CPT code.  The V
Treatment file is used to store procedures without CPT codes that do not
fit into any other V-file category.
 
The Provider Narrative field represents the preferred text for this
procedure as defined by the clinician.
