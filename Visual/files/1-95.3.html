Per VHA Directive, this file has been 'locked down' by Data 
Standardization (DS). The file definition (i.e. data dictionary) shall 
not be modified. All additions, changes and deprecation to entries in 
this file shall be done by Enterprise Reference Terminology (ERT) using 
the Master File Server (MFS), provided by the Common Services (CS). 
Creating and/or editing locally defined fields in the file are not

The LAB LOINC file contains an extraction of the LOINC database.  The
LOINC database provides sets of universal names and ID codes for
identifying laboratory and clinical test results.  The LAB LOINC file is
used to map the Laboratory WKLD CODE file(#64), also known as the National
Laboratory Test file, to LOINC codes.
 
This file is a standard file distributed by Dallas CIOFO and should
not be edited locally.
