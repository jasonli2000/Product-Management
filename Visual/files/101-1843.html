TRY examines selected entry for basic problems.
 
For titles and components with boilerplate text, this includes checking
any embedded objects to make sure the object is embedded correctly.
 
If the entry is a title and checks out OK, (or if its only problem is an
inactive object) the user can test the boilerplate text by choosing a
patient and entering a document using the entry. TRY does NOT require any
particular Status for the title, since documents entered during the trial
are deleted immediately after the trial.  During the trial, objects will
function even if inactive in order to permit testing of objects.
(Ordinarily, object data are not retrieved unless the object is active, so
be sure to activate when ready for use.)  Since the trial document does
show up on Unsigned lists during the time it is being edited, users should
select TEST PATIENTS ONLY.
 
If TRY is selected from the Boilerplate Text Screen, TRY shows which
objects are badly embedded and why.  Checks include whether the object as
written exists in the file, whether it is active, whether it is split
between lines, and whether the object as written is ambiguous as to which
object is intended.  If entry is OK, user can enter a trial document.
 
For objects, TRY checks object Name, Abbreviation and Print Name to make
sure they are not ambiguous.  That is, it makes sure the utility can
decide which object to invoke when given the Name, Abbreviation, or Print
Name and that it does not get the wrong object. TRY checks that the object
has an Object Method, but does NOT check that the Object Method functions
correctly.
 
For classes, document classes and components, TRY just checks for general
completeness and correctness.
