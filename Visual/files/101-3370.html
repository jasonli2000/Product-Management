<td><pre>
This protocol is an event point which monitors the editing of fields in
DG* application files.  At the time of this event point, the following
variables will be present in the environment:
 
        Variable        Description
        --------        -----------------------------------------------
        DGDA            DA array as exists during Fileman editing 
        DGFILE          File or subfile number where changed field resides
        DGFIELD         Number of changed field 
        DGTYPE          Type of cross reference action (ADD, DELETE or UPDATE)
        DGDTH           Date/time of change in $Horolog format 
        DGUSER          DUZ of user that made the change 
        DGOPT           Current menu option in "option_name^menu_text" format
        DGX             X array as documented for Fileman new style x-refs 
        DGX1            X1 array as documented for Fileman new style x-refs
        DGX2            X2 array as documented for Fileman new style x-refs
 
This protocol is triggered by "listener" cross references on selected
fields.  By employing logic such as "If DGFILE=2, DGFIELD=.361,
DGTYPE="ADD", then...", subscribers to this protocol may take action based
on edit activity which involves those fields.
 
This event point is designed to occur only once per field editing
activity.  The DGTYPE variable can be interpreted as follows:
 
       o  ADD transactions indicate that data has been added to a field
          that was previously null.  The DGX, DGX1 and DGX2 arrays will
          contain the Fileman X, X1 and X2 arrays (respectively) as
          documented for the execution of 'SET' logic.
 
       o  DELETE transactions indicate that previously existing data has
          been deleted without being replaced.  The DGX, DGX1 and DGX2
          arrays will contain the Fileman X, X1 and X2 arrays
          (respectively) as documented for the execution of 'KILL' logic.
 
       o  UPDATE transactions indicate that existing data has been deleted
          and new data has been filed.  The DGX, DGX1 and DGX2 arrays will
          contain the Fileman X, X1 and X2 arrays (respectively) as
          documented for the execution of 'SET' logic.
 
The naming convention used for these 'new style' cross-references for this
Patch are as follows:
 
  1. All names will begin with the letter "A" to denote a non-lookup MUMPS
     cross-reference.
 
  2. The next characters identify the name space (i.e. Registration ="DG").  
 
  3. The next two characters identify the field monitor utility ("FM").
 
  4. The next character will be "D" if the field contains a decimal. If 
     there is no decimal, there will not be a "D" character.
 
  5. The next characters identify the field number. 
 
The establishment of this naming convention is intended to assist with 
the easy identification of the field monitoring utility as implemented
across multiple field definitions.  It should be followed as additional
instances of this utility are distributed.
