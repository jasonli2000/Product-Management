Definition Revised (2007):
Sepsis is a vast clinical entity that takes a variety of forms. The 
spectrum of disorders spans from relatively mild physiologic 
abnormalities to septic shock. Please report the most significant level
using the criteria below:
 
1. Sepsis: Sepsis is the systemic response to infection. Report this 
variable if the patient has clinical signs and symptoms of SIRS. SIRS 
is a widespread inflammatory response to a variety of severe clinical
insults. This syndrome is clinically recognized by the presence of two 
or more of the following:
   - Temp &gt;38 degrees C or &lt;36 degrees C
   - HR &gt;90 bpm
   - RR &gt;20 breaths/min or PaCO2 &lt;32 mmHg(&lt;4.3 kPa)
   - WBC &gt;12,000 cell/mm3, &lt;4000 cells/mm3, or &gt;10% immature (band) 
     forms
   - Anion gap acidosis: this is defined by either:
      [Na + K] - [Cl + HCO3 (or serum CO2)]. If this number is 
      greater than 16, then an anion gap acidosis is present.
     or
      Na - [Cl + HCO3 (or serum CO2)]. If this number is greater
      than 12, then an anion gap acidosis is present.
 
 and one of the following:
   - positive blood culture
   - clinical documentation of purulence or positive culture from any 
     site thought to be causative
 
2. Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock: Sepsis is considered severe when it is 
associated with organ and/or circulatory dysfunction. Report this 
variable if the patient has the clinical signs and symptoms of SIRS or 
sepsis AND documented organ and/or circulatory dysfunction. Examples of
organ dysfunction include: oliguria, acute alteration in mental status,
acute respiratory distress. Examples of circulatory dysfunction 
include: hypotension, requirement of inotropic or vasopressor agents.
 
* For the patient that had sepsis preoperatively, worsening of any of 
the above signs postoperatively would be reported as a postoperative 
sepsis.
 
Examples:
 
A patient comes into the emergency room with signs of sepsis - WBC 31, 
Temperature 104. CT shows an abdominal abscess. He is given antibiotics
and is then taken emergently to the OR to drain the abscess. He 
receives antibiotics intraoperatively. Postoperatively his WBC and
Temperature are trending down.
  POD#1 WBC 24, Temp 102 
  POD#2 WBC 14, Temp 100 
  POD#3 WBC 10, Temp 99 
This patient does not have postoperative sepsis as his WBC and 
Temperature are improving each postoperative day. 
 
Patient comes into the ER with s/s of sepsis - WBC 31, Temp 104. CT 
shows an abdominal abscess. He is given antibiotics and is taken 
emergently to the OR to drain the abscess. He receives antibiotics 
intraoperatively. Postoperatively his WBC and Temp are as follows:  
  POD#1 WBC 28, Temp 103
  POD#2 WBC 24, Temp 102.6
  POD#3 WBC 22, Temp 102 
  POD#4 WBC 21, Temp 101.6
  POD#5 WBC 30, Temp 104  
This patient does have postoperative sepsis because on postoperative 
day #5, his WBC and Temperature increase. The patient is having
worsening of the defined signs of sepsis.
