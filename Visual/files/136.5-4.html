Definition Revised (2007):
Inflammation of the lungs caused primarily by bacteria, viruses, and/or
chemical irritants, usually manifested by chills, fever, pain in the
chest, cough, purulent, bloody sputum. Report as an occurrence if the
patient has pneumonia meeting the definition of pneumonia below AND
pneumonia not present preoperatively.
 
Pneumonia must meet one of the following TWO criteria:
Criterion 1.
  Rales or dullness to percussion on physical examination of chest AND
  any of the following:
  a. New onset of purulent sputum or change in character of sputum
  b. Organism isolate from blood culture
  c. Isolation of pathogen from specimen obtained by transtracheal
     aspirate, bronchial brushing, or biopsy
 
 OR
 
Criterion 2.
  Chest radiographic examination shows new or progressive infiltrate, 
  consolidation, cavitation, or pleural effusion AND any of the 
  following:
  a. New onset of purulent sputum or change in character of sputum
  b. Organism isolated from blood culture
  c. Isolation of pathogen from specimen obtained by transtracheal    
     aspirate, bronchial brushing, or biopsy
  d. Isolation of virus or detection of viral antigen in respiratory
     secretions
  e. Diagnostic single antibody titer (IgM) or fourfold increase in
     paired serum samples (IgG) for pathogen
  f. Histopathologic evidence of pneumonia
 
*If pneumonia was present preoperatively and resolved postoperatively 
and a new pneumonia is identified within 30 days after surgery, the
following criteria must be met in order to report as a postoperative
pneumonia occurrence:
   - Patient must have completed the antibiotic course for the 
     previous pneumonia.
   - Patient must have evidence of a clear chest x-ray after the 
     previous pneumonia and prior to the new pneumonia.
   - There must be evidence of a new isolate of micro-organism on 
     culture.
