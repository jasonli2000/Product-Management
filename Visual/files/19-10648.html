<td><pre>
The primary purpose of this option is to allow part-time
physicians with a Memorandum of Service Level Expectations to
record time and leave on their daily electronic subsidiary record
(ESR).  This option presents a list of pay periods for the
part-time physician to select.  Any pay period that appears in the
selection list must have one or more days that are in a status
that requires some action from the part-time physician.  Once a pay
period is selected, the option presents a summary of the memorandum
that contains the pay period and a summary of each day within that
pay period.  The physician can select any day in the pay period
that is not yet approved.  Once a day is selected, the option
presents a form that allows the part-time physician to edit and
electronically sign their time and leave for that day. 

Secondarily, this option will also present the part-time physician
with any recently ended memoranda.  Any such memoranda will appear
first in the selection list.  If selected, the option allows the 
part-time physician to review the memorandum and select a 
reconciliation option.
