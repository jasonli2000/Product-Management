<td><pre>
This Accounts Receivable option is used to schedule the DMC Debt Validity
Report to run on a recurring basis with out user intervention. The report
is used to assist users in focusing on reviewing the legitimacy of first
party bills for veterans who are SC 50% to 100% or in receipt of VA
Pension benefits. The report contains information on veterans who meet the
above criteria and have bills for episodes of care within the previous X
days with a DMC Debt Valid field not flagged as 'YES' or 'NO' and for
which the Current Status is Active, Open or Suspended. 
 
X will be the value entered in the "NUMBER OF DAYS FOR DMC REPORTS"
(#8.02) field of the AR SITE PARAMETER (#342) file. If this value isn't
entered the report will default to bills from episodes of care for the
past 365 days. This parameter can be edited using the Enter/Edit DMC
Report # Days for Episodes of Care [RCDMC EDIT DMC REPORT # OF DAY]

meeting the above criteria are reviewed and if necessary the appropriate
action is taken as follows:
     Bill is appropriate - Update the Debt Validity Status field to 'YES'
                           in order that the bill is referred to DMC via
