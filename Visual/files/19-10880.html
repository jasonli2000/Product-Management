This Accounts Receivable option is to assist users in focusing on
reviewing the legitimacy of first party bills where the veteran is neither
SC 50% to 100% nor in receipt of VA Pension benefits (Veterans not
included on the "DMC Debt Validity Report"). The report would contain
information on veterans who have bills for episodes of care within the
previous 365 days (or older selected date) and who have a new Rated
Disability during a user selected time period. 
 
Authorized billing staff can run the report to ensure that all bills
meeting the above criteria are reviewed and if necessary the appropriate
action is taken as follows:
   Bill is appropriate - There shall be no action taken.
   Bill is inappropriate - AR staff shall cancel the bill using existing 
                           functionality.
   Inappropriate bill sent to DMC - AR staff shall cancel/refund 
                                    using existing functionality.
 
The report allows for the user to select the time period for Rated 
Disabilities, to select the date from which to include bills for episodes
of care on the report, and to select if they want the report printed in a
Detailed Format or in an Excel Delimited Format. 
 
It is recommended that the user Queues this report to a device that is 132
characters wide.
 
The report will include the following data elements:
