<td><pre>
This Accounts Receivable option is used to schedule the Rated Disability
Eligibility Change Report to run on a recurring basis with out user
intervention. It is used to assist users in focusing on reviewing the
legitimacy of first party bills where the veteran is neither SC 50% to
100% nor in receipt of VA Pension benefits (Veterans not included on the
"DMC Debt Validity Report"). The report will contain information on
veterans who have bills for episodes of care within the previous X1 days
and who have a new Rated Disability during the last X2 days. 
 
X1 will be the value entered in the "NUMBER OF DAYS FOR DMC REPORTS"
(#8.02) field of the AR SITE PARAMETER (#342) file. If this value isn't
entered the report will default to bills from episodes of care for the
past 365 days. This parameter can be edited using the Enter/Edit DMC
Report # Days for Episodes of Care [RCDMC EDIT DMC REPORT # OF DAY]
option. 
 
X2 will be the value entered in the "# OF DAYS FOR RD ELIG CHG RPT"
(#8.01) field of the AR SITE PARAMETER (#342) file. If this value isn't
entered or is zero, the report will default to RD data for the last 31
days. This parameter can be edited using the Enter/Edit RD Number of Days
Report Parameter [RCDMC EDIT RD # OF DAYS PARAME] option.
 
Authorized billing staff can use the report to ensure that all bills
meeting the above criteria are reviewed and if necessary the appropriate
action is taken as follows:
    Bill is appropriate - There shall be no action taken.
    Bill is inappropriate - AR staff shall cancel the bill using existing
                            functionality.
    Inappropriate bill sent to DMC - AR staff shall cancel/refund
                                     using existing functionality.
 
The scheduled report can only be printed in the detailed format and it 
should be sent to a device that is 132 characters wide.
 
 The report will include the following data elements:
