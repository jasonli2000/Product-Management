<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
This report reviews fee invoice certification events and determines if 
there was a segregation of duty violation.  The certifier of a fee invoice
must not be the requestor, approving official, or obligator of the
associated 1358 obligation or any increase/decrease adjustments to the
1358 that were obligated before the invoice certification took place.
 
The release of a payment batch by a fee supervisor is the certification 
event.  The report examines all payment batches that were released during 
a specified period.  Each batch is associated with a single 1358. 
 
The results are sorted by 1358 and within that by the date and time of an 
event.  Three event types may be listed.
  Obligate - Initial obligation of the 1358 in IFCAP.
  Adjust   - Obligation of an increase/decrease to the 1358 in IFCAP.
  Certify  - Release of a fee payment batch associated with the 1358 
             by a fee supervisor.  The batch number is shown.
 
The IFCAP events have three roles (requestor, approver, and obligator).
 
The specified reporting period is used to select released fee batches.  
All prior IFCAP events for the 1358 are relevant to segregation to duty
and will be considered even if they precede the reporting period.
 
If YES is entered at the "Only list 1358s with a violation (Y/N)?" prompt,
only 1358s with at least one violation will be displayed.  Additionally,
the fee certifications (batch release) that do not violate segregation of
duties will not be displayed.  IFCAP and Fee Basis have been enhanced 
by patches PRC*5.1*148 and FB*3.5*117 to enforce segregation of duties for
a 1358 so no violations are expected after installation of those patches.
 
The Fee Basis batch data can optionally be purged by a site.  The IFCAP 
data is normally retained for at least 7 years, but must be purged prior 
to 10 years since the document numbers are recycled. If the source data
for this report has been purged, it will not be included in the report.  
Selection of a period starting 9 or more years ago may return inaccurate 
results due to recycling of 1358 document numbers.
