<td><pre>
This option provides information about Connector Proxy accounts for the 
purposes of:
1) Monitoring compliance with the 3-year mandate (per VA Handbook 6500)
   to expire/change verify codes for service accounts;
2) Reporting any mis-configured connector proxy accounts;
3) Listing account activity to help determine whether accounts are 
   active, and are being accessed from which remote locations.
 
When running the report, the following options determine how much 
additional content is listed for each account:
- Check/display connector proxy fields? YES/NO (checks for mis-configured
  accounts)
- Scan sign-on log for connector proxy activity? YES/NO (lists account
  activity)
 
Possible categorizations for whether accounts are reported as "Compliant 
w/3-year Service Account Mandate?" are:
- YES (account is complaint) 
- *** NO &lt;---- MUST FIX *** 
  (date created and date verify code last changed &gt; 3 years in the past)
- No, but user not active. 
- UNABLE TO DETERMINE 
  (until patch XU*8.0*574, date verify code last changed for Connector
  Proxy accounts was incorrectly recorded as 4/10/2005)
- unable to det. but not active.
 
If an account's Date Verify Code Last Changed is listed as "(changed but 
date not recorded)", that means the "fake" 4/10/2005" date is present, 
and unless the account was created within the last 3 years, it is 
impossible to determine if the account is in compliance with the 3-year 
mandate.
 
Also, if there is a value in the XUS Logon Attempt Count field, that 
value is displayed, as it could indicate a remote system attempting to 
connect and failing with an invalid verify code.
 
If the option to "Check/display connector proxy fields?" is selected, the 
following checks are performed:
- Warnings: (any field listed in the warning section should not be 
  populated. However, before changing, consult the National Help Desk or 
  Customer Support as some applications may (currently) be depending 
  (incorrectly) on a mis-configured connector configuration. 
- Values for other fields allowed/expected: (field normally populated for
  connector proxies)
- Other Fields Populated (not expected fields, but not problematic either)
- Other Multiples Populated (not expected, but not problematic either)
 
If the option to "Scan sign-on log for connector proxy activity?" is 
selected, the report will scan the sign-on log for all signon activity 
associated with the account. Any activity found is displayed, organized 
by client IP address, and within IP address, by date of sign-on. The 
purpose of this report section is to help a site determine which accounts 
are active, and which external systems (by IP address) are logging onto 
the site with the specified account. This may help determine which remote 
applications a change to the account (such as verify code change) might 
impact, and may also help a site determine whether too many remote 
applications/data centers are using the same account (which could result 
in a more widespread service disruption if an account must be changed).
