<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
This options allows the supervisor to regenerate the CENSUS WORKFILE
entries for a particular census date.
 
This option places one entry in the CENSUS WORKFILE for each
admission needing a census record for that selected census date.
 
The workfile is an extract of data from the admission data for the
patients who were inpatients as of 11:59 on the census date.  This
workfile makes the printing of the 'Census Status Report' faster 
than otherwise would be possible.  Without this workfile, it
would be neccessary to scan all admissions prior to the census 
date to determine if the admission was still active on the census date.
 
This option only needs to be run at the beginning of the census process 
and at the end of the process to ensure that no admissions have been 
added via bed control.  However, this option can be run at anytime
if desired. 
 
NOTE:  The 'Census Status Report' uses the the CENSUS WORKFILE. 
       As a result, the 'Census Status Report' should not be run until 
       after the regeneration is complete.
 
NOTE:  The first time the 'Census Status Report' is run for a
       particular census date, the CENSUS WORKFILE is automatically
       generated.
 
At the end of the regeneration process, the WORKFILE LAST UPDATED
field in the PTF CENSUS DATE file is updated with the current
date and time.
 
The 'Display Census Date Parameters' option displays all the 
parameters associated with a census date, including WORKFILE 
LAST UPDATED. A supervisor can use this option to
monitor the completion of a regeneration.
 
Also, at the end of the regeneration process, a Mailman bulletin
is sent to the user requesting the regeneration.  This bulletin
will indicate any changes that may have occurred as a result of
regeneration.
