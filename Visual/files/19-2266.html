<td><pre>
This option allows the user to check-in/check-out appointments by date 
for a selected clinic.  After a date and a clinic has been 
specified, the user is then prompted for patients to be 
checked in/checked out.
 
After a patient is selected, the system will determine if the 
patient had any appointments on that date for the clinic.  If 
there were no appointments for the clinic, the system will 
display a message and then ask for the next patient.
 
If there was an appointment, the system will display the 
clinic name, date/time of apppointment and the status of the 
appointment.  Next, the user will be asked to confirm that 
this is the correct appointment.  If the user answers 'yes', 
the check-in/check-out process is invoked.
 
If there was more than one appointment on the date for that 
clinic, the user will be asked to select an appointment.
 
After the user finishes processing one clinic, another clinic 
may be selected.  The user is also allowed to select another 
date.
 
 
This option is designed to allow input from a CRT's keyboard 
and from a barcode reader.  In order to use the barcode 
capibilities, the clinic's appointment list must be printed 
on a device that supports the printing of barcodes.
 
Also, the user can use the barcodes produced by the Record Tracking 
system, that are on the patient's medical record, to identify 
the patient.
