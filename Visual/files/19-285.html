<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
This option automatically purges unreferenced MailMan messages, that is,
it deletes from file 3.9, MESSAGE, any messages which are not in
anyone's basket.  It is strongly recommended that this option be
scheduled to run daily, right after option XMCLEAN.

The following messages are considered 'referenced', and will not be
purged:
 - Messages in user baskets
 - Messages in transit (arriving or being sent)
 - Server messages
 - Messages being edited (including aborted edits)
 - Messages which have been latered

Several fields in file 4.3, MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS, influence the
behavior of this option.  Here they are, but feel free to look at
their Data Dictionary descriptions for more information on them:

4.301 - NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER - MailMan does not purge any messages
created or received in the last few days.  You choose how many days.
The default is 2.

142   - NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER (LOCAL) - MailMan does not purge local
messages created in the last few days.  You choose how many days.
The default is 7.

4.304 - WEEKDAY DAYS TO PURGE - On Saturdays, MailMan goes through the
entire MESSAGE file looking for messages to purge.  On the other days
of the week, however, MailMan has the option of only looking at
messages created or received recently.  You choose how many days.  The
default is to go through the entire MESSAGE file.  It is strongly
recommended that you set this field to something reasonable, like 30
to 60 days.  (But only if you follow the recommendation to schedule
this option to run daily.  Otherwise leave this field blank.)

4.303 - AUTOMATIC INTEGRITY CHECK - MailMan gives you the option of
running the MAILBOX file portion of the integrity checker (option
XMUT-CHKFIL) before it actually purges the unreferenced messages.
The M xref on file 3.7 is used to determine whether a message is
referenced (in someone's basket) or not.  If the M xref is messed
up, then the purge might delete messages it shouldn't, or leave
message it should delete.  The integrity checker ensures that the
M xref is correct.  You choose whether to run it or not.  The default
is to run it.  The recommendation is to run it.  However, if you find
that it is simply taking too long, you may opt not to run it.  If
you opt not to run it, then it is recommended that you schedule option
XMUT-CHKFIL to run monthly, because globals can and do become corrupted.
