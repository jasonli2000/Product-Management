This option will print the status of data that is being uploaded
or has been uploaded from barcode readers.  The following are status
codes that are used as progress reports.
 
o ATTEMPTING DATA UPLOAD          - User is currently uploading data
o DATA UPLOAD FAILURE             - Data upload has failed
o DATA UPLOAD SUCCESSFUL          - Data has successfully uploaded
o TASKED FOR JUL 07,1989@14:50    - Data will be processed at specified time
o DEVICE NOT SELECTED             - User has not selected a device for processing
o RUN FAIL, RTN FLD IS MISSING    - Routine is not defined (446.4,.04)
o RUN FAIL, RTN IS MISSING        - Routine (446.4,.04) is not on system
o STARTED AT JUL 07,1989@14:52    - Data has started processing at specified time
o FINISHED ON JUL 07,1989@15:31   - Data finished processing at specified time
 
The above status give the ability to view the progress of data from the
point of when it was uploaded from the barcode reader to the time it has
been processed.  Certain status are errors, such as RUN FAIL, DEVICE NOT
SELECTED and these mean the data will never be processed because of an
unexpected error in the process.
 
The normal progression of status that data will take is:
 
  1) ATTEMPTING DATA UPLOAD
  2) DATA UPLOAD SUCCESSFUL
  3) TASKED FOR [date/time]
  4) STARTED AT [date/time]
  5) FINISHED ON [date/time]
