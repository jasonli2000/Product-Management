<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
You must hold the XMMGR and XMSTAR keys to run this option.
 
XMPURGE-BY-DATE will delete *all* messages originating before a cutoff
date. It will delete those messages from users' mailboxes, and then delete
them from the MESSAGE file, along with any responses chained to them. This
flexible option can be run interactively or scheduled to run on a
recurring basis, the cutoff date can be controlled, users may or may not
be sent a warning bulletin to warn them of the purge ahead of time, and
the option may produce a report to show how many messages and responses it
deleted.
 
When the option is run interactively:
 
1) It asks for the cutoff date. The default is based on the DATE PURGE
CUTOFF DAYS field (10.03) in the MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS file (4.3). If
that field is null, it defaults to 730 days (2 years) in the past.
 
2) It asks whether to run the option in Test mode. In Test mode, the
option will not purge any messages, just report how many and which would
have been purged.
 
3) It asks for the output device on which to print the report. The purge
and report can be queued here to run later.
 
4) If it's queued more than 3 days in the future, the option immediately
broadcasts the XM DATE PURGE WARNING bulletin to all users to notify them
of the upcoming purge and give them a chance to save off old messages
beforehand.
 
5) If it's queued less than 3 days in the future, or is not queued, no
bulletin is sent.
 
When the option is scheduled:
 
1) The option runs at the scheduled time, as specified by the QUEUED TO
RUN AT WHAT TIME field (2) of the OPTION SCHEDULING file (19.2).
 
2) If the RESCHEDULING FREQUENCY field (6) of file 19.2 is set, the option
is scheduled to run repeatedly.
 
3) It uses the DATE PURGE CUTOFF DAYS field, or the default of 730 days if
it's empty, to calculate the cutoff date.
 
4) It does not run in Test mode.
 
5) If the DATE PURGE GRACE PERIOD field (10.04) of file 4.3 is empty, the
purge runs at the time for which the option is scheduled.
 
6) Otherwise, at the scheduled time the option only broadcasts the XM DATE
PURGE WARNING bulletin to all users and queues a second task to perform
the date purge GRACE PERIOD number of days later.
 
7) If the DEVICE FOR QUEUED JOB OUTPUT field (3) of file 19.2 is empty,
the purge runs without printing a report.
 
8) Otherwise it prints the report on the selected device.
 
*Messages in SHARED,MAIL's mailbox and messages in the POSTMASTER's
remote transmit queues and server baskets (including released patch
messages on FORUM) are exempt from the purge.
