<td><pre>
This report produces two lists: most frequent diagnoses (ICD) and most
frequent diagnostic categories.  The list entries are ordered with the
most frequent encounter diagnosis first.  The most frequent
diagnosis categories list is based on the ICD diagnostic category related
to each diagnosis in the frequent diagnosis list.
 
The report can be generated using a number of different selection
criteria. The selection criteria are:
 
  Facility - select the facilities encounters to include in the report.
 
  Primary Diagnoses only or All Diagnoses - if primary is selected then
  only primary diagnosis associated with an encounter will be included in
  the report.  All diagnosis will include Primary and secondary diagnoses
  associated with an encounter.  
 
  Encounter Date Range - only encounters that fall within the specified
  date range will be used to generate the report.
 
  Number of most frequent diagnoses - this will determine how many
  diagnoses and diagnoses categories will be listed on the report. For
  example, if 20 was input for this criteria, the report would list up to
  20 of the most frequent diagnoses found associated with encounters.  The
  diagnoses are ranked from most frequent to least frequent.  The same is
  true for diagnostic categories.  If the encounters contained less than
  20 different diagnoses, then the report would list all the different
  diagnoses that were found.
 
The remaining criteria are optional for singling out diagnosis entries
based on other encounter or patient data. The user can accept the default
"other" encounter/patient criteria which is all VA Clinic encounters
(Service Category of "A" or "I") for all patients.
 
Other encounter/patient report selection criteria:
 
   Service Category - only encounters with the specified service
   category or categories will be used to generate the report. This
   defaults to "AI" for Ambulatory encounters and encounters at a clinic
   where the patient had an inpatient status.
 
   Clinic Stop Code - only encounters with the specified list of clinic
   stop codes will be used to generate the report.
 
   Provider criteria can specify All Providers, Primary
   Providers, Selected Providers, or Selected Provider Classes.
 
        Providers - only encounters, where one of the encounter providers
        is the same as one of the providers selected, will be used to
        generate the report.
 
        Primary Providers - only encounters, where one of the encounter
        providers is designated as a Primary provider, will be used to
        generate the report.
 
        Provider class - only encounters, where one of the encounter
        providers has the same provider class as one of the providers
        classes selected, will be used to generate the report.
 
   Patient Date of Birth Range - only encounters, where the patient's date
   of birth falls in the specified range, will be used to generate the
   report.
 
   Patient Sex - only encounters, where the patient's sex matches the
   specified sex, will be used to generate the report.
 
To include all encounters, ignoring all defaults for the other criteria,
the user may specify "A" for All Encounters at the Other criteria prompt.
