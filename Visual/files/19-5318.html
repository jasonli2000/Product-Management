<td><pre>
This function allows the package coordinator to enter new
procedures into the system and to edit existing procedures.
 
Entries in this 'procedure' file are the allowable choices the
user will be able to choose from at the 'Procedure' prompt.
This prompt appears as part of the 'Request an Exam', 'Register' exam,
'Case No. Edit', and the 'Exam Status Tracking' functions.
 
If the procedure has an inactivation date of less than the current
date then the procedure is not a valid choice and will not appear
on the list of valid/active procedures when displayed to the user.
 
There are four types of procedures.  They are the following:
 
      1) Detailed - Procedure is associated with one or more AMIS codes
                    and must have a CPT (Current Procedural Terminology)
                    code assigned to it.
 
      2) Series   - Procedure is associated with more than one AMIS
                    code and must have a CPT code assigned to it.
 
      3) Broad    - Procedure is mainly used by the receptionist when
                    scheduling a patient for an exam.  It is used
                    when he/she is not exactly sure which 'detailed' or
                    'series' procedure will be performed. However,
                    before the exam can be considered 'complete', the
                    procedure must be changed to 'detailed' or 'series'.
 
                    If the 'division' parameter requiring a 'detailed'
                    or 'series' procedure upon initial exam registration
                    is set to 'yes', then the receptionist will not be
                    allowed to select a 'broad' procedure.
 
       4) Parent  - Procedure is a "placeholder" used for ordering.  It
                    does not have a CPT and cannot be registered.  Parent
                    procedures must have one or more descendant procedures
                    associated with them.  The descendants should be
                    detailed procedures with valid CPT codes.  During
                    Registration, the system automatically cycles through
                    each descendant and asks if you want to register it.
                    After each descendant is either registered or
                    bypassed, the opportunity to add additional procedures
                    is given.  All are registered under the same exam
                    date/time.  Parent procedures can be set up to require
                    a single report for all CPT's, or individual reports
                    for each CPT.
