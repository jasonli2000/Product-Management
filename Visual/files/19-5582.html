This option will utilize the List Manager utilities to list the SSNs
available for uploading to DHCP.  The IVM Center has sent the SSNs for the
patient and his/her spouse to SSA for review.  In some cases, they were
unable to match the SSN and found a likely SSN based on name, sex, and
date of birth.
 
This list will give the name of the patient, the DHCP SSN, the suggested
SSN from SSA, the spouse's name, the spouse's DHCP SSN, and the suggested
SSN for the spouse.  If no spouse is listed, it does not necessarily mean
that the patient is not married, but rather there is no new suggested SSN
for uploading.  In cases where there are suggested SSNs in both the
veteran and spouse columns, you will be able to choose to upload one or
both of the SSNs.
 
There are two options available:  The first is UP or Upload.  This will
allow you to put the data in the SSA SSN columns into the DHCP fields for
the veteran and/or spouse.  If both the veteran and the spouse columns
contain data in the SSA SSN column, you will be asked if you want to
upload the veteran SSN, the spouse SSN, or both.  Once you upload the SSNs
for a patient, the uploadable data will be deleted and the line will no
longer display on the screen.
 
The second option is PU or Purge.  If you feel the SSA SSNs for a patient
and/or spouse are not the correct ones, you may choose this option to
purge the upload data from the file and remove the line from the list.
 
Also available are several standard List Manager options.  To get a list
of the options available in these 'hidden' options, enter a '??' at the
action prompt.  One option of particular interest would be PRINT.  This
will allow you to print the entire list to a printer for review before you
begin uploading data.
