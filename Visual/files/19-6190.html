<td><pre>
This option produces the M&amp;M Verification Report which may be useful for
  (1) reviewing occurrences and their assignment to operations
  (2) reviewing death unrelated/related assignments to operations
 
The full report includes all patients who had operations within the 
selected date range who experienced intraoperative occurrences,
postoperative occurrences or death within 90 days of surgery. The
pre-transmission report is similar but includes operations with completed
risk assessments that have not yet transmitted to the national database.
 
Full Report:
Information is printed by patient, listing all operations for the patient
that occurred during the selected date range, plus any operations that may
have occurred within 30 days prior to any postoperative occurrences or
within 90 days prior to death. Therefore, this report may include some
operations that were performed prior to the selected date range and, if
printed by specialty, may include operations performed by other 
specialties. For every operation listed, the intraoperative and
postoperative occurrences are listed. The report indicates if the
operation was flagged as unrelated or related to death and the risk
assessment type and status. The report may be printed for a selected list
of surgical specialties.
 
Pre-Transmission Report:
Information is printed in a format similar to the full report. This report
lists all completed risk assessed operations that have not yet transmitted
to the national database and that have intraoperative occurrences,
postoperative occurrences, or death within 90 days of surgery. The report
includes any operations that may have occurred within 30 days prior to any
postoperative occurrences or within 90 days prior to death. Therefore,
this report may include some operations that may or may not be risk
assessed, and, if risk assessed, may have a status other than 'complete'.
However, every patient listed on this report will have at least one
operation with a risk assessment status of 'complete'.
