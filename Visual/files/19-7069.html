<td><pre>
The New Clinic Visits option allows you to enter A&amp;SP clinic visits 
into the computer. When entering a new visit, if all required 
information is not typed in, the entire visit is deleted. This is 
done to eliminate errors caused by incomplete data.
  
After you identify the division and clinic location, the software asks you
for the visit date. QUASAR defaults to today's date and will accept any
DHCP date format except a future date.
  
At the "Select A&amp;SP Patient Name" prompt, enter the patient's name. 
If a new name is entered (i.e., a name not previously in the A&amp;SP 
PATIENT file (#509850.2)), QUASAR asks if you want to add the new 
patient to the file. The software also gives you the cumulative count 
of unique patients entered in the file.
 
If the selected patient does not have a Primary Eligibility the system
displays an error message to this effect and returns to the division
prompt.
 
If you have not selected an existing visit and the Send to PCE value on
the Site Parameters file for the selected division is set to true the
system checks to see if there are any appointments set up for this patient
on this date.  If there are they are displayed, you have the option to
select one.  If you select an appointment the appointment time is used to
populate the visit time field in the visit record.  If there are no
appointments for the patient the system then checks if there are any PCE
visits for the patient on the selected day.  If there are they are
displayed and you are given the option to select one.  If one is selected
data from the PCE visit (that is valid within QUASAR) is used to populate
the visit record.
  
Next, QUASAR provides a brief patient inquiry excerpt, a list of rated 
disabilities, Service Connected data and the A&amp;SP problem list if any
diagnostic codes have been entered.
 
You are then required to enter a visit time.
  
You are asked to enter the initial visit date. If the patient is a 
new patient, the initial visit date is the date of the patient's first 
A&amp;SP clinic visit.
 
If the USE ASP CLINIC FILE NUMBER parameter is set to YES for the
Division, the system shall prompt you to enter the Local Clinic Number for
the Patient.
 
If the USE C&amp;P parameter is set to YES for the Division, then the system
shall look for an open C&amp;P request for the Patient. If one is found then
the system will prompt if the Visit you are entering is a C&amp;P Exam.
 
If you have selected a PCE Visit then the system will have retrieved
all the Diagnosis Codes from the PCE Visit that are valid for QUASAR and
these codes shall be displayed. You will not have to re-enter the same
Diagnosis Codes into QUASAR.
QUASAR asks for a diagnostic code (i.e., ICD-9-CM code). For evaluations, 
the disease codes are those conditions found to be present during the 
evaluation. For treatment and therapy visits, the disease codes are those 
conditions which are TREATED. Conditions previously diagnosed during an 
evaluation but not treated during the visit are NOT entered. The 
first code entered is always assumed to be the primary complaint. 
Disease codes are added to the Problem List.  You should exercise 
caution when entering disease codes.
 
If the Send to PCE parameter for the Division is set to NO the Visit
Eligibility will not be prompted.
If the Send to PCE parameter for the Division is set to YES and the
Patient is not defined as Service Connected then the system will set the
Visit Eligibility to the Patient's Primary Eligibility and this field will
not be displayed.
  
If the Send to PCE parameter for the Patient is set to YES and the Patient
is Service Connected the system will prompt for the Visit Eligibility. It
will display all the Patient's Eligibilities. If the list of Eligibilities
does not include NSC (Non-Service Connected) then this will also be
displayed. The system shall prompt the user to select an Eligibility for
the Visit from those displayed.
 
If the Send To PCE parameter is set to YES for the Division, and the
Patient is Service Connected then the system shall prompt if the Visit's
Treatment was Service Connected. 
 
If the Send To PCE parameter is set to YES for the Division, the Visit's
Treatment is Service Connected and the Patient is classified as having
been exposed to Agent Orange, the system shall prompt if the Visit's
Treatment was related to Agent Orange Exposure. 
 
If the Send To PCE parameter is set to YES for the Division, the Visit's
Treatment is Service Connected and the Patient is classified as having
been exposed to Radiation, the system shall prompt if the Visit's
Treatment was related to Radiation Exposure. 
 
If the Send To PCE parameter is set to YES for the Division, the Visit's
Treatment is Service Connected and the Patient is classified as having
been exposed to Environmental Contaminants, the system shall prompt if the
Visit's Treatment was related to Environmental Contaminants. 
 
Depending on your site parameter settings, the software may ask for
audiometric data. These data fields are used to enter audiometric 
thresholds and word recognition scores. The audiometric fields appear 
for all C&amp;P exams (even when a code for normal hearing [389.8] is 
entered) and for any routine audiometric evaluation where a hearing 
loss code is entered in the diagnostic code field. The audiometric 
data field does not appear when a code for normal hearing (389.8) or 
when a non-hearing loss code (e.g., dizziness 780.4) is entered in 
the diagnostic code field. Enter a whole number between -10 and 105. 
Missing data is coded as 1. No response at the limits of the 
audiometer or 105 dB HL, whichever is lower, is coded as 110.
Note: VACO prohibits presentation of audiometric stimuli.
 
If the user selected a PCE Visit, the system shall copy the Providers
associated with the PCE Visit over to QUASAR, discarding any that are not
defined as active on the A&amp;SP Staff file. Prior to prompting for the
Providers for this visit, the system shall display the Providers copied
over from PCE.
  
Next, you are prompted for Primary Provider, Secondary Provider and
Student. The Primary Provider field contains the name of the primary A&amp;SP
Provider who participated in the exam. If a second Provider was involved
with the visit, enter his or her name.  If a Student was involved with
this visit, enter the student's name. A screen allows you to select only
Providers and Students, who are active on the exam visit date.
 
If the you selected a PCE Visit, the system shall copy the Procedure
codes and any associated CPT Modifiers and Procedure Volumes, for that
Visit over to QUASAR, discarding any that are not defined as active on the
A&amp;SP Procedure file or the A&amp;SP CPT Modifier File. Prior to asking you to
enter the Procedures for this visit, the system shall display any
Procedures (with CPT Modifiers and Volume) copied over from PCE.
 
QUASAR asks for a procedure code (i.e., CPT-4 code).
After entering a CPT Procedure code the system shall prompt for any CPT
Modifiers (if appropriate) and a Volume, before returning to ask for
another CPT Procedure Code.
 
The final prompt is for the total time spent during the clinic visit. 
Time is recorded in minutes and is to include direct (e.g., face-to-face) 
and indirect time (e.g., paperwork, documentation, administration).
 
If the Send to PCE parameter is set to YES for the Division the system
shall ensure that the each of the required PCE fields has had data
entered.  If any required fields have not had data entered they are
displayed.  You then have the option to return to the amend the visit or
quit and therefore delete the visit.
  
The New Clinic Visits option is not used to edit visits. Existing 
clinic visits can be edited with the Edit an Existing Visit option.
