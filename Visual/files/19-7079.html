<td><pre>
The A&amp;SP Site Parameters option allows you to enter data into the
A&amp;SP SITE PARAMETERS file (#509850.8). This data determines how
QUASAR behaves when entering Visit information at your site.
  
After entering your site name you will be asked whether you wish
QUASAR to INTERFACE WITH PCE. If you answer YES then the overnight
batch transmission job that sends the data to PCE will be activated.
  
Next you must define each Division for which Visit data is recorded
at your site. For each Division you will then be asked whether or
not data for this Division should be sent to PCE, whether or not to
use Local File numbers to identify patients, whether or not to use 
the AMIE C&amp;P Interface, whether or not to require audiometric data 
for hearing loss Diagnosis Codes, and the names of all the clinics 
at which the visits take place.
  
In order to use Quasar to record visit data for a Division, the 
Division must be defined on this file and have a status of ACTIVE.
The Status should be set to INACTIVE if you no longer record visits
for a Division or you have entered a Division by mistake. (You can 
not delete a Division from this file but changing the status to 
INACTIVE has the same effect). The Division status referred to here
applies only to Quasar and has no effect on any other packages.
  
If the parameter INTERFACE WITH PCE is set to YES, then visit data 
will be transmitted to PCE for all Divisions that have the SEND TO
PCE parameter set to YES. This means the interface may be turned off
for a single Division by setting the SEND TO PCE parameter for that
Division to NO. If the INTERFACE TO PCE parameter is set to NO then
NO DATA will be sent to PCE for any Division.
  
Answer YES or NO to the USE ASP CLINIC FILE NUMBER field. Some sites 
have existing LOCAL (not medical center) file numbers associated with 
their Audiology and Speech Pathology patients and wish to continue 
using these numbers. If you answer YES, you can cross-reference 
QUASAR visit entries to your current file numbering system.
    
The USE C&amp;P field can be answered YES or NO. Answer YES if you wish 
to use QUASAR's AMIE/C&amp;P interface. If you use a different reporting
procedure and do not wish to use the AMIE/C&amp;P interface, answer NO.
  
The AMIE linkage feature allows entry of text and audiometric data
in the AMIE format, adequation of the results, and hand-off of the 
report to the AMIE Compensation and Pension package. If this option 
is enabled, QUASAR is informed when an Audiology C&amp;P exam is 
scheduled. When an entry is made for the patient, the user is asked 
"Is this a C&amp;P exam?" If the user responds yes, in addition to the 
usual QUASAR information, narrative data is requested for generating
the AMIE report.
  
If the C&amp;P exam prompt does not appear, the patient entered is either 
(1) not a C&amp;P patient, (2) Veterans Affairs Regional Office (VARO)
did not request an AUDIO exam (see Form 2507), or (3) the patient's 
C&amp;P claim has been closed by the C&amp;P Unit. Users should contact their 
C&amp;P Unit. If it is determined that the patient has a C&amp;P visit, the 
C&amp;P prompt can be turned on by entering ^C after the patient 
identifying information is entered.
  
Answer YES or NO to the BYPASS AUDIOMETRICS field. Certain diagnosis 
codes (i.e., hearing loss codes) are flagged to require audiometric 
data to be entered when those codes are used for a visit. By 
answering YES for the BYPASS AUDIOMETRICS field, you allow users to 
bypass the entry of that data.  If you answer NO, users are not 
allowed to bypass the entry of audiometric data.
  
The final prompt is for CLINIC LOCATION. Clinics can be established 
by name (e.g., Audiology or Speech Pathology), by function (e.g., 
Hearing Aid Clinic or Dysphagia Clinic), or by clinician (e.g., 
Audiology-Smith). Only clinic locations established by MAS can be 
selected. Contact MAS for further information. Multi-divisional sites 
or those with more than one A&amp;SP location are entered. There must be 
at least one clinic entered for this field.
