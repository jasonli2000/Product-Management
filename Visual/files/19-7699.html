<td><pre>
This option goes through the MAIL BOX global and removes any mailbox if
 - the user is not in the NEW PERSON file.
 - the user has no access code and was not terminated.
 - the user has no access code and was terminated w/o mailbox retention.
 - the user has an access code, but no primary menu.
 - the user has an access code and primary menu, but no verify code, AND
   - has never signed on or used mail, since being added before a cutoff date.
   OR
   - last signed on or used mail before a cutoff date.

However, if the user meets one of the last two conditions above, but has
a forwarding address, the user's mailbox will not be removed.  The fact
will be noted on the report, and the user should be investigated further.

Remove means:
 - Delete user's private mail groups
 - Remove user from membership in all groups
 - Remove user as an authorized sender from all groups
 - Remove user from anyone's list of surrogates
 - Delete user's latered-messages list
 - Delete user's mail box

As a result, the user will not receive any mail.

This option can be run in 'test' or 'real' mode.

The report lists, in DUZ order:
 - The user's DUZ and name
 - Whether the user has an access code, verify code, and primary menu
 - When the user was added to the NEW PERSON file
 - When the user last signed on or used mail
 - When the user was terminated (if applicable)
 - If the user was terminated, then whether the site manager chose to
   delete the user's mailbox.  (It's generally a good idea to go ahead
   and delete the mailbox upon termination.)
 - If the user has an access code and a forwarding address, the user
   is marked with '***', and the forwarding address is shown.
   (Again, the mailbox is not deleted in this case, but the user should
   be investigated further.)
