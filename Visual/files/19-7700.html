<td><pre>
This option goes through the MailBox global and reports on users who
*perhaps* should have their mail access terminated.
 
Users are included in the report if
 - the user was DISUSER'd.
 - the user was terminated before a manager-supplied cutoff date
   and allowed to keep a mailbox.
 - the user has an access code, verify code, and primary menu,
   but last signed on or used mail before a manager-supplied cutoff date.
 - the user has an access code, verify code, and primary menu,
   was added before a manager-supplied cutoff date, but has never signed on
   or used mail.
 
This option does not terminate mail access.
 
The report page breaks on Service/Section and includes the following
information:
 - User's DUZ and name
 - Whether the user has an access code, a verify code, and a primary menu
 - When the user last signed on or used mail
 - When the user was terminated (if applicable)
 - If the user was terminated, then whether the site manager chose to
   delete the user's mailbox.  (Remember, you should usually answer 'yes'
   to this question, unless the user is coming back and needs to have his
   mail retained.)
 - Whether the user was DISUSER'd
 - How many new messages the user has.  (New messages are never purged,
   except during purge-by-date purges.)
 - If the user has any surrogates, the first surrogate is shown.
 - If the user has an access code and a forwarding address, the forwarding
   address is shown.

Besides being of interest to the Site Manager, this report is also
designed to be submitted to other services. The intent is that the
other services would check each of their users listed in the report,
annotate whether MailMan or VistA access should be terminated, and
return the report to the Site Manager to act on.
