<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
This is an option for entering differential counts in hematology using
a CRT keyboard.  It functions very much like an automated instrument
that is connected to the LSI.  The parameters that define what characters
on the keyboard represent what portions of the differential are defined
in the AUTO INSTRUMENT file under the entry KEYBOARD DIFF.  For each
test there are 3 parameters (PARAM).  PARAM 3 is the character on the 
keyboard that represents that test.  For example, if the test SEGS had a 
PARAM 3 equal to 1, then whenever the character 1 was pressed, a SEG would
be added to the total count of SEGS.  Tests that occupy internal numbers
1-27 in the AUTO INSTRUMENT file at the level CHEM TESTS are used in the
entry of the WBC count.  WBC count occupies three rows of characters: (1-9),
(10-18), (19-27).  The keys '-', '!', '?' are reserved functions.
  If PARAM 2 is equal to 1 for these tests, then
these tests will be used in the total count of WBC cells.
PARAM 2 equal to 2 means that the test is not included in the total count.
PARAM 1 is used to change the value of V, which is the value of the test
you are counting or editing.  For example, using the previous example,
whenever you press 1, you are adding 1 to the total count of SEGS, so the
value of SEGS (V at this point) is changed to a percentage of total WBC
cells counted.
RBC Morphology tests are located at internal numbers 31-58 occupying
3 rows on the keyboard (31-39), (40-48), (49-58).  
The backslash '\' is used to display the WBC values.
To verify data entered with this option use the EA option.
The conditions of reviewing and
verifying data entered with this option are the same as any other
automated instrument.  The LOAD/WORK LIST field entries used to test
this option are as follows:
NAME: DIFF
LOAD TRANSFORM: UNIVERSAL
TYPE: SEQUENCE/BATCH
CUPS PER TRAY: 0
FULL TRAY'S ONLY: NO
VERIFY BY: ACCESSION
PROFILE: DIFF
ACCESSION AREA: (whatever is appropriate)
TEST: (whatever is appropriate)
 
This option will only work with CRT's that have cursor addressing
capabilities and is VT-100 compatible.
