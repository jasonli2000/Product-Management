<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
This option invokes an instrument specific routine to take a load list
and prepare it for sending (downloading) to the instrument.
The option first asks what instrument to work on, Then tells what load
list will be used.  There is a question asking if the job should be 
queued to the background.  Then each cup of each tray that has been
built into the load list is worked on by the instrument specific
routine to prepare it for sending.  The data from this pass is saved
in the load list file in node 2 of the cup entry.  This means that
only one instrument can use the load list at a time.  The lab techs
MUST be carefull in management of the load list for the instrument.
At this time all cups that are on the load list will be sent, so
care must be taken to see that only accessions that should be sent
are built and that after sending the load list is unloaded and
these accessions are not built to the load list when setting up the
load list for the next run.
 
Tech notes:  This is done in a two pass operation.
1. This pass gets the accession and tests from the load list and
builds records for the instrument that are stored in node 2 of the
cup entry (see DD listing).
2. In this pass the data from pass 1 is put together in the form
that is needed for the protocol. For the Ektachem700, LAEKT7D
builds the records that need to be sent, and LAKERM2 adds
the kermit file headers, record head and checksum, and file trailer.
This is all controled by LADOWN along with the AUTO INSTRUMENT file.
The entry points into LAKERM2 or other protocol routines have
fixed names: START^LAxxx is called once before the first data call.
NEXT^LAxxx is called once for each tray before the cup data is 
started. (with the ektachem each tray is a file.)
DATA^LAxxx (both parts from the file) is called for each record
found in the load list.
END^LAxxx is called once at the end to close out the file.
