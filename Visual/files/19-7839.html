This report may be run for either selected hospital locations, all
hospital locations, selected clinics, or all clinics. The report format
is a summary by patient for each selected location. For each location,
Scheduling data is used to identify patients with appointments during
the Patient Appointment Date Range. (The user can specify whether or not
each location should be started on a new page.  This is useful for
clerks printing and then distributing the reports to multiple
locations.)

VISTA data for these patients is then examined for possible patient
activities during the Patient Activity Date Range.  Patient
activities include inpatient stays, emergency room encounters and
critical lab values.  A summary of each of these follows.

Inpatient stays:  All inpatient activities within the Patient Activity Date
Range are reported.  These include admissions and corresponding discharge, if
there is one, discharges and corresponding admission, and current
in-patient status.
 
Emergency Room encounters:  All encounters within the Patient Activity
Date Range that have an identified Emergency Room location are
reported. Emergency rooms are identified through the PCE PARAMETERS
file.  This data is entered by the clinical coordinator or IRM staff
through the 'PCE Report Parameter Setup' option.
 
Critical Lab Values:  All critical lab values reported within the
Patient Activity Date Range are presented, along with a column to identify
whether the value is critically high or critically low.
 
Finally a search for future appointments is made within the Future
Appointment Date Range.  Any future appointments within this date range
are listed.

Within each location the patients are listed alphabetically followed by
a list of their appointments and activities.  Only patients with
activities will be included in the report.
 
This report was developed as a measure of continuity of care. If a
provider of record has his or her care-giving interrupted through
clinical rotation, leave, reassignment, or for any other reason, this
report may be used to get an update on patient activities in his/her
caseload. This report is also useful when care is not interrupted.
Clinical staff may wish to review patient activity by location for
events  which they may be unaware of.
 
 
Technical Description:
 
Patient appointments are found by examining the appointment multiple of
the Hospital Location file for the specified locations during the time
frame specified by the Patient Appointment Date Range.
 
Admissions and discharges that occurred during the Patient Activity Date
Range are found using the ATT1 and ATT3 cross-references of the
Patient Movement file.  A search for the corresponding discharge or
admission is made using the IN5^VADPT call.  Current inpatient status
is determined using this same call.
 
Emergency room locations must be defined in field 801 of the PCE
PARAMETERS file, which is a multiple pointing to the HOSPITAL LOCATION
file. The ER clinic names are stored permanently at the global
location: ^PX(815,D0,RR1,D1,0). The Visit File is examined for
encounters during the Patient Activity Date Range which have a location
matching one of the defined emergency room locations.
 
Laboratory data assessed for critical values is based on the Subfile 63.04
of the Lab DATA file (63), which stores results from Chemistry,
Hematology, Toxicology, RIA, Serology, and others.  Critical values are
identified through a pattern match of a numeric value followed by a "*".
The global location read is ^LR(LRDFN,"CH",INVERSE LAB DATE, LAB TEST
FIELD NUMBER). Piece one contains the result. Piece 2 indicates a critical
value and if it is high or low (e.g. *H).  This search is confined to
the Patient Activity Date Range.

Future appointments are found using the SDA^VADPT call for each patient
within the Future Appointment Date Range.
