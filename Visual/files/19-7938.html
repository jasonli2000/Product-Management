<td><pre>
 This option allows the DSS extract manager to create the CLINICS AND
 STOP CODES file (#728.44) which will contain clinics, the stop codes
 assigned to those clinics by MAS, and the stop codes used for those
 clinics by DSS.  The process by which new clinic entries are added and 
 existing clinic entries are edited is as follows:
  
 NEW CLINIC ENTRIES
  1. The HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) is searched for all clinics.  
     Clinics that are currently inactive are ignored.  
  2. New clinic entries to the CLINICS AND STOP CODES file (#728.44) are 
     added with the following field defaults:
     a. STOP CODE field (1) = STOP CODE NUMBER field (8) in HOSPITAL 
        LOCATION file (#44)
     b. CREDIT STOP CODE field (2) = CREDIT STOP CODE field (2503) in 
        HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44)
     c. DSS STOP CODE field (3)= STOP CODE NUMBER field (8) in HOSPITAL 
        LOCATION file (#44)
     d. DSS CREDIT STOP CODE field (4) = CREDIT STOP CODE field (2503) 
        in HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44)
     e. ACTION TO SEND field (5) = 
        "1" (SEND STOP CODE) if CREDIT STOP CODE field (2) does not
            exist
        "5" (SEND BOTH AS ONE RECORD WITHOUT NATIONAL CODE) if CREDIT 
            STOP CODE field (2) exists
        "6" (DO NOT SEND) if Clinic is flagged as a "non-count" clinic 
            in HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44)
 
 EXISTING CLINIC ENTRIES
  1. All pre-existing clinics are checked against their counterpart in 
     the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) to be sure that the STOP CODE 
     field (1) in the CLINICS AND STOP CODES file (#728.44) matches the 
     STOP CODE NUMBER field (8) in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44).  
     The same check is made on the CREDIT STOP CODE field (2) to be sure 
     that it matches the CREDIT STOP CODE field (2503) in the HOSPITAL 
     LOCATION file (#44).
  2. Any pre-existing clinic that has had a change to its active status
     or non-count status in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) will be
     reported in an 'UNREVIEWED CLINCS' report with a symbol that 
     identifies the change.  This is the same report that is printed
     via the 'UNREVIEWED CLINICS' option of the 'Clinics and DSS Stop
     Codes Print' menu option.
  3. Any stop code changes to pre-existing clinics will delete the DATE 
     LAST REVIEWED field (6) in the CLINICS AND STOP CODES file (#728.44).
     This will ensure that the edited clinics will print out as 
     "unreviewed" the next time the clinic worksheet (from the "Clinics 
     and DSS Stop Codes Print") is produced.
