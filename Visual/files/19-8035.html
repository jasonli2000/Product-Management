This option can take a few minutes to run.  Use it when you have some
extra time to explore the sharing relationships among files.  With it,
though, you can find out which tables are often referenced by others.
 
You will be prompted for a cutoff point.  This is used to subset the
resulting groups.  If you use a high cutoff, like 150, you will get back
a fairly short shared table list, including only those files that have
more interconnections that the cutoff, like New Person and Patient.
 
A cutoff around five might give the most useful subdivisions.  That
might put 200-300 tables in the shared group, leaving all the other
tables in fairly small mutually exclusive groups of 30 or so.  This
approach ends up with a large number of small tables, though, like around
700 or more.
 
The purpose of this utility is to give you an idea about how to group
tables when assigning access to users by profile.  If you already had a
user profile with access to a set of interrelated tables, you could use
the profile for other users who were interested in the same tables.
 
Note that this utility doesn't list tables without any connection to
others (a relatively small set, however!).  Also note that the table that
has the most sharing activity compared with other members of the group
is used to identify the group in this option's printout.
 
After entering a cutoff, you are prompted for a table of special
interest.  If you want to see where a particular table ends up in the
final analysis, enter it here.  As a result, after the shared tables
are listed, you will get a special report showing your table and its
group.  After that, all the groups are listed.
 
Running this option with several cutoff points might show the following:
 
 Cutoff   Total Shared   Number of other Groups   Member totals

There isn't any right way; just experiment as you wish!
