<td><pre>
This report is based on "parent" encounters in the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER
file.  The term "parent" in this case is used to refer to records where
the PARENT ENCOUNTER field is null ("child" encounters are OUTPATIENT
ENCOUNTER records that contain a pointer in this field to another 
OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER record). 
 
Facility workload, via transmission to NPCDB, is derived from "parent"
encounters that have a status of CHECKED OUT and have been referred to
the transmission process.  Information contained in "child" encounters
is not referred directly to the transmission process, but rather, 
gathered with the "parent" encounter when the "parent" encounter is
transmitted.
 
The OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER WORKLOAD section of the report is a count of
"parent" OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTERS by status values that are considered
to be "for credit".  These statuses include CHECKED IN, CHECKED OUT,
NO ACTION TAKEN, FUTURE, and ACTION REQUIRED.  Only statuses found
in the database for the date range are reflected on the report.
 
Only encounters in the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER WORKLOAD section (encounters
with "for credit" statuses) are used to calculate visits and uniques as
reflected in the FACILITY OUTPATIENT VISITS and FACILITY OUTPATIENT
UNIQUES sections of this report.
 
The NON-WORKLOAD section of the report is a count of "parent" encounters
by statuses that are not given outpatient workload credit (nationally).
These include DELETED, NON-COUNT, INPATIENT APPOINTMENT, NO-SHOW, and
CANCELLED statuses.  Only statuses that are found will appear on the
report.
 
Within the CHECKED OUT category of the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER WORKLOAD
section, encounters are further sub-categorized by transmission status.
Only sub-categories that are found will appear on the report.  These
sub-categories include:
 
   'No transmission record' - These are "parent" encounters that are
    checked out but have not been referred to the transmission 
    process (which should have happened when the record was checked
    out).  
 
    'Rejected for transmission' - Encounters in this category have failed
    to pass the checks for data elements required for transmission of
    workload to Austin.
 
    'Not required, not transmitted' - These are encounters that have
    been referred to the transmission process (they have a record in
    the TRANSMITTED OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER file) but are not flagged to
    be transmitted, nor have they been transmitted. 
 
    'Awaiting transmission' - These are records that have been referred
    to the transmission process since the last nightly transmission.  
    They will be sent in the next nightly transmission if they pass the
    the pre-transmission screening requirements.
 
    'Transmitted, no acknowledgement' - These are encounters that have
    been referred to HL7 for transmission to Austin.  If there were no
    problems with HL7, they have been sent to Austin.  The number in 
    this category should roughly match the average number of encounters
    produced by a facility on any given work day.  If these numbers are
    substantially greater than the facility's average daily workload,
    it may indicate a problem with HL7 has caused a failure to transmit
    data to Austin; or, it may indicate a problem with the incoming
    filer that processes the acknowledgment messages returning from
    Austin.
 
    'Transmitted, rejected' - These are encounters that have been sent
    to Austin but have failed the requirements for filing into NPCDB.
 
    'Transmitted, error' - One of the possible Austin acknowledgement
    statuses (not currently in use).
 
    'Transmitted, accepted' - These are encounters that have been
    sent to Austin, processed, and an acknowledgment message indicating
    acceptance has been returned to the facility.  This indicates the
    encounter has been recorded in NPCDB for national facility workload
    credit.
 
The FACILITY OUTPATIENT VISITS section of the report is a count of one
per patient per day (regardless of the number of encounters a patient
may have had on a given day).  For multi-divisional sites, the station
totals are not the sum of all divisions.  If a patient was seen at more
than one division on a single day, they reflect as a visit to each 
division; however, they are still just a single visit for the facility
on that date (as calculated by this report).
 
A patient visit will accrue to only one of the sub-categories in this
section.  If a patient had multiple encounters on a single day and as
few as one of those encounters has a "transmitted, accepted" status,
the patient's visit will accrue in the 'Transmitted, accepted visits'
sub-category.  If none of the patient's encounters on that date have
have a "transmitted, accepted" status, the visit will accrue to the
'Act. Req./not accepted' sub-category.
 
The FACILITY OUTPATIENT UNIQUES section of the report is a count of one
per patient for the entire date range (regardless of the number of visits
a patient had).  For multi-divisional sites, the station totals are not
a sum of all of the divisions.  If a patient was seen at more than one
division during the date range, they reflect as a unique patient for
each division; however, they are still counted as a single unique for
the facility (as calculated by this report).
 
The unique patient will accrue to only one of the sub-categories in this
section.  If the patient had multiple visits during the date range and
as few as one of those visits had an encounter with a "transmitted,
accepted" status, the unique will accrue to the 'Transmitted, accepted
unique pts.' sub-category.  If none of the patient's visits had any
encounters with a "transmitted, accepted" status, the unique will accrue
to the 'Act. Req./not accepted unique pts.' sub-category.
