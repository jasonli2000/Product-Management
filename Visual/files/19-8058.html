<td><pre>
This report provides a summary of PCE encounters. For the purposes of this
report an encounter is any entry in the Visit File. The report can be run by
location or by provider. Encounters included in the report
are selected by a combination of date range, service categories, and encounter
types.

Data for the selected encounters is categorized and summarized in several ways.
CPT codes associated with encounters are classified by Evaluation and
Management Code. Those falling into the E&amp;M group are
sorted into the categories new, established, consult, and other.

The number of unique patients is determined for each location and for all the
locations selected for the report. The sum of the uniques for each location
will generally be larger than the total number of uniques
because a patient may be counted as a unique in more than one location but will
only be counted once for the entire facility.

Three visit totals are calculated. A visit is defined as any patient activity
at a location in one day.  Thus a patient having multiple encounters at a
location on one day will count as one visit. The three visit totals given are
total visits, inpatient visits, and outpatient visits. The sum of the inpatient
and outpatient visits will not be equal to the total visits if a patient had
both an inpatient and outpatient visit on the same day.

For each selected encounter an attempt is made to find an associated
appointment. This is done using the Outpatient Encounter file which provides a
link between encounters and appointments. Purpose of Visit data is tabulated
for each appointment that is found. Purpose of Visit includes the categories
C&amp;P, 10-10, scheduled, and unscheduled.

If there is an appointment without an associated encounter it will not be
tabulated on this report. Cancelled and no-show appointments do not have an
associated encounter so they cannot be included in this report. Even if they
could, the information on cancelled and no-show appointments stored in
Scheduling is not complete making it impossible to give accurate counts.
