<td><pre>
This option generates a report of the estimated savings or cost from use
of the RBRVS Fee Schedule during a user-specified date range.  The Date
Finalized field is used to select the payments.  The results are grouped
and reported by CPT CODE-CPT MODIFIER(S) values.  Additional detail is
printed when the output device supports 130 characters per line.  The
report columns are described below:
 Total Occurrences: The count and total amount paid for all payments.
 Payments at RBRVS: The count and total amount paid for payments whose
     amount paid is equal to the RBRVS fee schedule amount that was
     calculated during payment entry.
 Estimated Payment if RBRVS was not used: This column is only displayed
     when the output device supports 130 characters per line.  It displays
     what the system believes might have been paid if the RBRVS fee
     schedule had not been implemented.  If the service is covered by
     the VA 75th Percentile Fee schedule, then the system assumes that
     payment would have been made at that amount.  Otherwise, the system
     assumes that the amount claimed is usual &amp; customary and would have
     been paid.
 Est. Savings from RBRVS: The estimated payment amounts minus the actual
    RBRVS payment amounts.  Negative values are shown in parenthesis.
