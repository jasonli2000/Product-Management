WARNING:  CAUTION SHOULD BE TAKEN WHEN USING THIS OPTION!!
 
This option should be used only on Medicare Group plans that were created
combining Part A and Part B coverage on the same policy.  The Medicare
Remittance Advice enhancements require patients to have separate Medicare,
will not reimburse, Part A  and Part B policies.  This tool will assist
sites with separating combined policies they may have.  The MCCR
Coordinator should select someone to have this option on their secondary
menu.  IRM may need to assist with the placement of the option. 
 
Not all sites will need to run this option.  If this option is not needed
or no longer needed, please remove it from all user access.  This is a one
time run option and will be deleted in a future IB patch.  Users of this
option must be experienced with creating and managing Medicare Insurance
Information using the Patient Insurance Menu options.  When executing this
option the steps described below are executed. 
    
   
Functional Description:  
    
   
1. A check will be made to ensure that the standard Medicare, Will not
   Reimburse, Part A and Part B plans are setup at the site.  If not,
   the site cannot proceed.
     
2. This option will allow a user to select an Insurance Company 
   whose Type of Coverage is Medicare.  This should be the Medicare
   company that holds the combination plan.
        
3. The user selects a Medicare Insurance Company plan.  This should
   be the non-standard combination Part A and Part B plan.
                              
4. The user will be asked if it is Okay to continue. 
                                      
5. If the user responds 'NO' then nothing is changed and they are exited
   from the option.
                   
6. If the user responds yes they have the opportunity to queue the output
   to a printer or their screen.
     
7. Each policy associated with the combination plan will be changed to
   point to the standard Medicare Part A plan.  A duplicate copy of the
   policy will be created but associated with the standard Medicare
   Part B plan.
   
8. A check for duplicate entries will be made.
  
9. The output will list the policies that could not be converted.
   If the patient already has a Medicare WNR Part A or Part B
   policy entered, the combination policy will remain with the 
   combination plan and be listed on the report. These exceptions
   will need to be reviewed and inactivated manually.
  
10. When no subscribers are left under the combination plan. All annual 
    benefits coverage limitations associated with the non-standard 
    combination plan will be deleted. 
    
11. The non-standard combination plan will be deleted.
     
12. If no plans and no subscribers are associated with the non-standard
    Medicare Insurance company, users may use the Delete a Company
    action to remove the Insurance Company entry.
