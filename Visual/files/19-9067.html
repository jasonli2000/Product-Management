<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
This option allows printing extract results stored in the REMINDER
EXTRACT SUMMARY file (810.3).  This option lists extracted data by
finding item and social security number. The finding items are loaded into
the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY file when one of the following options is
run:
   LREPI ENHANCE MANUAL RUN    Lab Search/Extract Manual Run (Enhanced)
   LREPI NIGHTLY TASK          Lab Search/Extract Nightly Task
 
The Lab EPI (Emerging Pathogens Initiative) extract name follows the
convention: LREPI YY/MM MMDDYY, where the YY/MM is the year and month from
the date range specified by the LREPI extract option that created the
extract. MMDDYY is the month, day and year that the extract was run. The
prefix of LREPI identifies the extract as the result of LREPI extract
options (manual or automatic run for the LREPI Lab Search/Extract
Protocol).
 
To print all extracts for the target reporting month,enter "LREPI YY/MM"
at the FROM prompt, with the year and month's data to be reported.  At
the TO prompt, you can limit the print to extracts for the reporting month
by adding a suffix to the LREPI YY/MM, for example "LREPI YY/MM z" will
get all extracts that were created for the target reporting month,
regardless of when they were run.
 
If there have been multiple runs for the target month, you can further
define the FROM and TO range by specifying LREPI YY/MM MMDDYY with the
MMDDYY being the date the report was run. There will normally only be one
extract per month.  More than one will exist if your site runs the LREPI
ENHANCE MANUAL RUN to correct errors found by the Austin Automation
Center on the monthly transmission of EPI data sent by the LREPI NIGHTLY
TASK.
