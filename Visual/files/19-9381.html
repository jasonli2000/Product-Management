<td><pre>
 
 
This is a very powerful utility option to be used to reconcile
previous LOINC historical mapping. A knowledgeable LOINC mapper is 
required to properly implement this functionality.
  
After initial historical mapping has been completed, adjustments maybe 
required to modify the LOINC code lookup parameters to properly map past 
results. Careful review of current LOINC mapping should be done to 
establish IF there is a systematic error in LOINC code assignments. File
definition corrections should be done to prevent future LOINC mapping
errors. Re-running LAB DATA LOINC Mapping [LR LOINC HISTORICAL MAPPER 63]
option will correct the problem.
  
In those situations when editing LOINC mapping parameters is not 
desirable, this option provides a method for the user to intervene in the
mapping logic for specific tests.
  
The user is able to select test(s) [Atomic or Panel], then assign a 
specific suffix code to be used during LOINC mapping logic. In addition
the user is able to force the Result NLT CODE (#64.1) of LABORATORY TEST
(#60) for the test and the designated suffix code pair to override
previous LOINC mapping.
  
This is a very powerful feature, great care and study should be used 
before attempting correct past LOINC mapping systematic errors.
After the user has completed the modify LOINC mapping procedures, the 
LAB DATA LOINC Mapping option is called. All considerations of this option
still applies. Most notably, only performing this mapping exercise during
week ends or in a 24 period of lowest system activity. Even with the
increased logic iterations, the process should complete within the 24 hr
window of time.
  
 Option example: 
  
      This option will allow you to manage how specific DataNames
          will be mapped to LOINC Codes for historical data.
  
 You are able to override file definitions to correct past LOINC 
mappings. Select the CH subscripted tests, indicate the suffix to be
used. The user can indicate if this suffix should override
previous LOINC Mapping.
  
This option will REMAP your entire database.
  
  
 This option should only be run on weekends after hours.
  
  Do you wish to continue ? YES 
  
           Selection can be a 'CH' Atomic or Panel test.

           Selection can be a 'CH' Atomic or Panel test.

 [NOTE: Those tests in the panel that do not have a RESULT NLT CODE 
assigned will be omitted. If this is the case abort and attend to the
missing panel tests.
