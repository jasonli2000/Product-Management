<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
This bulletin will be delivered to the OR CACS Mail Group. It informs the 
group that a new NTRT Request has been initiated by a Clinician at their 
facility. Upon receipt, the CACs should discuss the request internally, 
and with their local Medical Records Committee. If the group concurs, they
should file an official NTRT request for the new term/expression at the
NTRT website: 
 
http://vista.domain.ext/ntrt/
 
The NTRT Terminology Stewards for the Problem List Domain will consider
the request, and inform the facility of their decision as to whether the
new term should be added to the Enterprise Terminology.
 
If the local group does not concur with the request, they should defer
filing an NTRT Request, and discuss the decision with the requester.

A New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) mail message has been sent to you

subset.

clinically useful, and does not already exist within the Problem List 
subset. If the term is found appropriate, then submit a NTRT request at 
the NTRT website, http://vista.domain.ext/ntrt/. Follow the link to 
Access the NTRT Request Web Site.
 
The Problem List domain steward will review each request and respond to 
you with the outcome of this request. If the term is approved by the 
Problem List NTRT committee it will be added to the Problem List subset 
and made available within future searches.  
 
The progress of this request may be monitored by accessing the NTRT 
website at the NTRT website.
 
If you have questions, need more information, or are having accessibility 
problems with this website, please contact STS by Exchange E-Mail: [VHA
