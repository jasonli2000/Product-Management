NOTE: THIS CLASS INCLUDES IMAGE FORMING DEVICES AND ASSOCIATED AIDS, THEIR
SUBASSEMBLIES AND COMPONENTS, UTILIZING PASSIVE AND/OR ACTIVE TECHNIQUES FOR
DETECTION, OBSERVATION, AND IDENTIFICATION OF TERRAIN AND OBJECTS AT NIGHT,
WHILE MAINTAINING CONCEALMENT AFFORDED BY DARKNESS. INCLUDES SIGHTING AND
OBSERVATION DEVICES; TARGET DETECTORS; LOCATORS AND VIEWERS UTILIZING 
RADIATION PROJECTED FROM NEAR INFRARED SOURCES AND/OR DETECTION. EXCLUDES
OPTICAL SIGHTING DEVICES WHICH INCORPORATE BOTH DAY AND NIGHT VIEWING 
CHARACTERISTICS WITHIN AN INTEGRAL UNIT FOR FIRE CONTROL PURPOSES; AND
NONIGHT VISION OPTICAL SIGHTING DEVICES DESIGNED FOR USE WITH GUIDED MISSILE
COMMUNICATIONS, OR LABORATORY EQUIPMENT. ALSO EXCLUDED FROM THIS CLASS ARE
ITEMS FOR WHICH MORE SPECIFIC CLASSIFICATIONS ARE SUITABLE AS PRESCRIBED BY
THE STRUCTURE AND INDEXES OF THE FSC.
INCLUDES SIGHTING, OBSERVATION, AND COUNTERMEASURE DEVICES; TARGET DETECTORS
LOCATORS AND VIEWERS UTILIZING RADIATION PROJECTED FROM NEAR INFRARED SOURCE
AND/OR UTILIZING LOW LEVEL NATURAL RADIATION AS REFLECTED FROM AN OBJECT(S).
ALSO INCLUDED ARE ASSOCIATED RADIATION SOURCES, IMAGE CONVERTER AND INTEN-
SIFYING TUBES; POWER SUPPLIES AND OTHER COMPONENTS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR
NIGHT VISION USE; SIGHTING AND OBSERVATION DEVICES; TARGET DETECTORS AND 
LOCATORS; REMOTE VIEWING SYSTEMS UTILIZING HEAT RADIATION EMITTED FROM
OBJECT(S); ASSOCIATED SOLID STATE RADIATION INTENSIFIERS; PHOTOCONDUCTERS; 
HEAT SENSITIVE TUBES, CELLS, AND ELEMENTS, AND OTHER COMPONENTS SPECIFICALLY
DESIGNED FOR NIGHT VISION EQUIPMENT. ALSO INCLUDES ITEMS HAVING THE COM-
BINED CAPABILITY OF UTILIZING BOTH REFLECTED
AND EMITTED READIATION.
EXCLUDES OPTICAL SIGHTING DEVICES WHICH INCORPORATE BOTH DAY AND NIGHT
VIEWING CHARACTERISTICS WITHIN AN INTEGRAL UNIT FOR FIRE CONTROL PURPOSES,
AND NONIGHT VISION TYPE ITEMS DESIGNED FOR USE WITH GUIDED MISSILES, 
COMMUNICATIONS, OR LABORTORY EQUIPMENT.
