NOTE: (1) A MICROCIRCUIT IS DEFINED AS FOLLOWS: A SMALL CIRCUIT HAVING A      HIGH          
EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT ELEMENT DENSITY, WHICH IS CONSIDERED AS A SINGLE PART 
COMPOSED OF INTERCONNECTED ELEMENTS PLACED AND/OR FORMED ON OR WITHIN A
SINGLE SUBSTRATE TO PERFORM AN ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT FUNCTION. THE ELEMENTS MAY
BE FORMED ON OR WITHIN A SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIAL SUBSRATE; MAY CONSIST OF

MICROCIRCUIT AS APPLIED TO CIRCUIT DEVICES INCLUDED IN THIS CLASS IS DELIMITED TO EXCLUDE  ITEMS CONSISTING SOLELY OF MONOLITHIC THICK-FILM OR THIN-FILM 
STRUCTURES THAT IN THEMSELVES ARE NOT FUNCTIONAL ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS
(e.g. CAPACITORS,RESISTORS, TRANSISTORS, OR "ARRAYS" THEREOF)
INCLUDES INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DEVICES; INTEGRATED CIRCUIT MODULES; INTEGRATED
ELECTRONIC DEVICES; HYBRID, MAGNETIC, MOLECULAR, OPTO-ELECTRONIC, AND THIN
