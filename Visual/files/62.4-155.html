To set up the VITEK unidirectionally you will need to run the program
CIEP on the VITEK to configure the instrument.  If you are running with
bidirectional you will need to run the program BCIEP to accomplish this.
 
To set up the VITEK for unidirectional the following paramaters should
be set as:
 
ON/OFF SWITCH:      OFF
RETRY WAIT:         10 SECONDS   (SET TO MAX ALLOWED)
ACK WAIT:           3  SECONDS   (SET TO MAX ALLOWED)

In some instances the VITEK will not recieve our acknowledge back in the
10 second time limit of VITEK and will retransmit the record a second time.
If this is occuring from the console of the VITEK enter /ETC/HOSTCTS OFF
This command will in most cases clear up double sending of records.
 
The VITEK has one caution that must be remembered.  If during transmission
the VITEK does not receive acknowledgement from the CPU that the records
had been received within 3 tries it will turn the interface off.  When 
this occurs several things must be remembered.
1.  The VITEK will not transmit again until the operator turns the
interface back on.
2.  Once the interface has been turned back on the operator can retransmit
records ONLY if the cards have NOT been removed from the machine.  If they
have been removed the entire test must be rerun.
 
This node of the Auto Instrument file is configured to support revision
AI of the VITEK software.  Sometime around release of Revision L there was
a change in the reporting of values out of the VITEK.  Then with the release
of Revisions W and above to Revision AI they have periodically changed
values being reported.  The entries in this file have been set up for
Revision AI and therefore NOTE that we will support only revision AI or
later.
 
The VITEK has several tables which need to be built before the
instrument can be run.  These tables have an entry and then a
abbrreviation.  These tables are set up to match your DHCP tables.
 
Now we are ready to start setting up the VITEK entry which has several
steps that must be followed in sequence in order to set the entry up
properly.
 
STEP 1.
The VITEK uses a large number of drugs when doing its reporting.
You MUST have all drugs entered into the Antimicrobial Sensitivity file
(62.06) and the Lab Data File (63) before setting up the Autoinstrument
file (62.4).  See the Lab installation guide for particulars for 
adding new drugs to the system.
 
STEP 2.
Also since the VITEK can report over 100 different organisms make sure that
all the organisms are entered into the Etiology file (61.2) before setting
up the Autoinstrument node (62.4).  See lab installation guide for
procedures on adding a new organism to the etiology file.
 
STEP 3.
Step thru the beginning fields and fill them in as you would normally
do.  Several fields will need to be set up differently depending on
whether you are running unidirectionally or bidirectionally.
These fields are:
Program Name  uni = LAMIVTK  bi = LAMIVTKU
Handshake response   uni = S OUT=$C(6)  bi = D ^LAMIVTKC
 
STEP 4.
The entry comes with 10 card types already started for you.  These entries
are never to be deleted as other entries will refer back to them.
Using your VITEK interface documentation enter the card type you will
want to enter organisms or drugs for.  Step thru the prompts until you
come to the Select Organism prompt.  Enter the organism name and its
card code for each organism for this card type.   Once you have organisms
entered for the intitial 10 entries you do not have to enter organisms for
any of the following card types as the code will refer back to these
initial entries.
 
When entering a new card the process card call field needs to be filled
in with the MUMPS code listed below for PRocessing call.  For example
if you want to process a GNS-F1 card which has a card code of 54 you
would enter 'D ^LAMIV12'.
 
Card  Ref. 
Code  Spec.   Name    Processing call
 01   5.1     GPS-A   D ^LAMIV11
 02   5.3     GPSSA   D ^LAMIV11

 0FB  5.11    GPI-2   Mate to '0F' which holds 2nd organism table.
                      Called from '0F' card if needed.
 10   5.13    GPS-M   D ^LAMIV11
 11   XXX     SCC     NOT SUPPORTED BY VITEK
 12   5.10    UID-3   D 510^LAMIV10
 13   5.14    GNS     D ^LAMIV12
 14   5.15    GNU     D ^LAMIV12
 15   5.16    GNS-T   D ^LAMIV12
 16   5.17    GNU-T   D ^LAMIV12
 17-A4   GNS FLEX     D ^LAMIV12
 
Since so many of the cards have the same organisms identified they are
entered only once on one type of card.  The Gram Positive cards
use 1 of 2 tables of organisms which are listed under card types '0F'
and '0FB' and these tables are used for lookup of the organism for all
gram positive identifications whether it is on an GPI card or on a 
GPS flex card.  The Gram Negative codes are handled by a single table
identified under the GNI card and is used for all flex panals also.
Gram Negative flex cards can list up to 5 organisms on one card and
when this occurs the organism list is found on the GNS card.
 
The following is a list of where the organisms will be found for 
the different cards.
 
Card '0F' is the main GPI card, and is used by all GPS cards for
          Org ID lookup.
Card '0FB' is the secondary GPI card used to hold second table of
          organisms.  It is used by processing routine when needed.
          This card is a Pseudo card and therefore does not have a call.
Card '0E' is the main GNI card, and is used by all GNS cards for
          Org ID lookup.
CARD '10' is the main GPS flex card and is used by all other flex cards
          for Organism lookup when multiple organisms are identified.
CARD '05' is the main card used for identifying yeasts.
CARD '0B' is used to identify urines
CARd '12' is also used to identify urines.
CARD '13' is the GNS flex card and is used by all other flex cards
          for organism lookup when multiple organisms are identified.
CARD '14' is the GNU flex card and is used by all other flex cards
          for organism lookup when multiple organisms are identified.
CARD '0C' is used for Bacillus identification.
 
STEP 5
Now step to the Select drug prompt for the card type.  If the
documentation has a list of drugs for that card type then enter the
drug name, its param 1, its card code, and the print order.
 
Many of the drugs listed for a card type have more than one code
associated with the drug.  When this occurs you will add the drug
name to the listing once for each code associated with that drug.
 
The VITEK data is processed by a set of routines that start LAMIV.
        LAMIV00 is routine used to determine MIC value for the drug.
                The routine is called from the param1 field of the drug
                subfield of the micro card type field.  The param1 is in
                the form: "S RUN="x"_U_LARTN D @RUN  where "x" is the line
                tag to enter the routine LAMIV00..  The Tag line in the
                routine LAMIV00 for each entry point tells which drug codes
                and type of card (pos, neg) are valid for this entry point.
                For example if you are using a gram negative card which
                reports out the drug code as 'C' for tetracycline you 
                would find by looking at the routine LAMIV00 that the 
                proper entry point would be at 'I' and the entry in param1
                would then be 'S LARTN="I"_U_"LAMIV00" D @LARTN'.
        LAMIV10 is routine used for processing bacillus and urine ID cards
        LAMIV11 is routine for processing Gram Positive identification,
                flex cards and Yeast cards.
        LAMIV12 is routine for processing Gram Negative identification
                and Gram Negative flex cards cards.
 
The above routines will convert the VITEK coded data to an organism
name, a drug name, a raw MIC value, and an interpretation which will
all be shown to you upon verification.
 
Certain drugs have codes which can not be entered thru fileman.  These
drug codes are "^@?".  These characters have special meaning to FILEMAN
and cannot be entered directly.  To get around this problem the routine
LAMICRA is included.  This routine will prompt for the autoinstrument
entry, the card type and then walk thru the drug nodes displaying the
entered code.  You can enter the code or enter a return at this time.
The routine will either continue when a return is entered or enter the
code into the file and build the "C" cross reference entry for you.
 
****NOTE**** If the autoinstrument file is ever recross referenced you
will have to reenter these codes as they will be lost.
 
The last field here is the print order field.  This field is used by
the verify code to display the list of drugs in whatever order you
chose.  This was primarily added so that the organisms and drugs would
display in the same order as the printed VITEK form.
 
Occasionally VITEK will start producing a new card type.  These cards will
usually have a card code above A4.  If you want to use the new card be
sure of the type of card it is and use the process card call that is used
for a similar card.
 
When running in bidirectional mode some additional fields need to be
filled in.
 
The FILE BUILD ROUTINE field needs to have the program name LAMIVTKD
which builds and stores the download records from the load list file.
 
In the Lab Site Parameter file you will need to respond to the new field
DOWNLOAD FULL DATA.  If you answer YES the routines will download all
of the data available about the patient and test.  If you answer NO the
routines will only download the minimum information needed by the 
instrument to run the test.
 
In the LAB TEST file those tests that are to be downloaded will need a
unique number assigned to it (0-9) in the field MICRO PREFIX CODE.
 
The auto instrument file has 3 additional fields to fill in.
Send tray/cup - which is a yes/no answer and is the default display
when you start generating the download file.
Queue build - is a yes/no answer that is the default display when
starting to generate a download file and determines if the file is
built while you wait or is queued out to run by itself giving you
you terminal back immediately.
 
Be very aware that the verify routines used by the rest of the LAB will
NOT work for microbiology.  Use only the verify routines for micro
which will be supplied.
