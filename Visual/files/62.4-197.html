<td>INTERFACE NOTES</td>
<td><pre>
 To enable the interface, press SYSTEM, then FILES, enter 1.18, then press
 DISPLAY. Enter the password 2215 and press STORE. Set the
 communication defaults for the COM2 port, turn the IMX system
 off, wait 10 seconds, then turn it back on. This initializes the
 parameters in memory.

 The interface may be tested by reprinting the results from the last run.
 
 ***The instrument uses a DCE configuration. Lines 2 and 3 must be
 crossed so that it will transmit as a DTE interface.
 
 The LAIMX routine is written to process data that is transmitted in
 the MEIA Quantitative layout as defined in the IMX unidirectional RS232
 Interface Guide, pages 7-10.
 
 Param 2 holds the number of decimal places for the result.
 Param 3 holds the number of the test as identified by the instrument.

 This interface will transmit in a multiple of different formats depending
 on the tests being run. This version as of 8/13/93 will handle the data
 streams for the ASSAY NUMBER, %GHb and %A1C tests, as well as linearity
 checking.
 **The %A1C test will require the following code to be placed into Param
 1: S LATFLG=1. All other tests should not have this variable set. The
 linearity functionality can be controlled by entering the following code
 in Param 1: S LRLN(III)="X.X" where the X.X represents the linearity value
 for this test. If no linearity checking is to be enabled, Param 1 should
 be set LRLN(III)="0.0".
