---------------Radiology Site Parameter Initialization Routine-------------
  In order to run the radiology module you must have at least one
  radiology division and one radiology loacation defined in the
  database.
 
  Use this program to either initialize your division and location
  parameters or to update them if they are already defined.
 
Radiology Division
------------------
The radiology module is designed to handle multiple divisions within a
medical center.  While most medical centers only have one division,
there are a number that are multi-divisional.  As a result, it was necessary
to structure the entire system around the division concept.
 
However, single division medical centers will not notice this in the 
everyday execution of the module.  Only in the initial set-up will there
be any reference to 'division' for these single division sites.
 
Each division will have its own set of parameters defining such
division-wide criteria as, should the exam 'requested date' be asked
and are impressions required on reports.
 
Radiology Location
------------------
Within a specific division there may be a number of physical locations
where a radiology procedure can be performed.  For example, a division
may have its main radiology department on the second floor and it may also 
have a satelite location on the first floor at an outpatient clinic area.
 
The module is designed to handle multiple locations within a division.
Each location will have its own set of parameters defining such
location-specific criteria as printer devices for flash cards and jacket
labels.
 
Location Within Division Diagram
--------------------------------
The following diagram illustrates the multi-division, multi-location within
a division concept.

  A       B       C              D               E    F . . . . y    z
 
NOTE: A location can only be associated with one division.
 
Prerequistes for Initialization
-------------------------------
If you are running this routine for the first time then you will not be 
able to answer many of the location parameter prompts.
These parameters are pointer fields to files that you will need to 
build as part of the initialization process (day-one files).
 
However, the important thing at this point is to enter at least one
division and one location under that division.
 
The other steps required as a prerequisite to the initialization process
are the following:
          1) site manager should add the 'RA OVERALL' menu option to
             the 'XUCORE' menu option so s/he will have access to 
             the module.
          2) site manager should give the radiology coordinator access
             to the 'RA OVERALL' menu.
          3) site should manager should have all 'RA' keys.
          4) radiology coordinator should have all 'RA' keys except
             the 'RA SITE' key. ('RA SITE' is used as a lock to the 
             'Computer Site Manager Menu'. Functions in this menu should
             only be performed by the site manager after discussions
             with the coordinator.)
 
After these actions are taken, the initialization of the module can be
accomplished entirely within the radiology module itself.
 
File Manager
------------
Use of File Manager should not be needed unless a change in a template
is desired.  However, be advised that some input templates contain a large
amount of branching logic and as a result modifications of these
templates should be approached with great care.
 
The following input templates fall under this category:
           a) RA REGISTER           - exam registration
           b) RA EXAM EDIT          - exam edit
           c) RA REPORT EDIT        - report entry/edit
           d) RA STATUS CHANGE      - status tracking
           e) PROCEDURE EDIT        - editing the procedure type file
           f) STATUS ENTRY          - editing examination status file
           g) RA VERIFY REPORT ONLY    - verifying reports
 
 
Day-One Files
-------------
The following chart lists which day-one files that have to be initialized.
The chart also indicates which radiology option to use to accomplish this 
initialization and whether the file is pointed to by a division or
location parameter field.

 Device Specification        COMPUTER SITE MANAGER;DEVICE SPECIFICATION
                                 - assign default printer devices for 
                                   each location.
                                 - create a table of input devices for 
                                   each location. The system uses this
                                   table upon user entry into the radiology
                                   module to determined the user's radiology
                                   location. If user's current device is not
                                   in the table then user will have to be
                                   prompted for radiology location. Once
                                   the module knows the user's location
                                   the system will automatically use the 
                                   parameters for that location and division
                                   during the session.
 
 Failsoft/Timeout             COMPUTER SITE MANAGER;FAILSOFT
                                 - specify DTIME for radiology module
                                 - specify if computer system is in
                                   normal operating mode or a failsoft
                                   mode as far as radiology is concerned.
                                   If radiology is placed into a failsoft
                                   mode the devices specifications are not
                                   used by the system.
