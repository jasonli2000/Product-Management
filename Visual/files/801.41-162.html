{FLD:VA-WH MAMMOGRAM GUIDANCE}
 
*The VHA recommends screening for breast cancer with mammography every 2 
years for average risk women age 50 through 74.
 
*The decision to start regular screening every 2 years with mammography 
for average risk women age 40 to 49 years should be an individual decision
and take the patient's values into account including  values about
specific benefits and harms.
 
*The VHA neither recommends for or against screening for breast cancer for
women age 75 and older.  The current evidence is insufficient to assess
the balance of benefits and harms of screening for breast cancer with
mammography in women age 75 and older.  If screening for breast cancer
with mammography is offered, patients should understand the uncertainty
about the balance of benefits and harms.
 
*The VHA neither recommends for or against clinician breast exam for 
breast cancer screening.  The current evidence is insufficient to assess 
the additional benefits and harms of clinical breast examination beyond
mammography for breast cancer screening.
 
*The VHA recommends AGAINST clinicians teaching women how to perform 
breast self-examination for breast cancer screening.  While routinely 
teaching women how to perform systematic, structured breast
self-examinations is not recommended, women should be encouraged to report
breast changes or abnormalities they discover to their provider.
