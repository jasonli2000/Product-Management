Major Depressive Episode (abstracted from DSM-IV, page 327)
 
 
a. At least five of the following symptoms have been present during the
same 2-week period, nearly every day, and represent a change from previous
functioning. At least one of the symptoms must be either (1) depressed
mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure:
 
   (1) depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by
   self or others.
 
   (2) markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all,
   activities.
 
   (3) significant weight loss or weight gain (5%/mo.) or loss/gain in
   appetite nearly every day.
 
   (4) insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
 
   (5) psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (as noted by
   others*).
 
   (6) fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.
 
   (7) feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt
   nearly every day.
 
   (8) diminished ability to think or concentrate or indecisiveness nearly
   every day.
 
   (9) recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a
   specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing
   suicide.
 
b. The symptoms caused clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
 
c. Symptoms are not better accounted for by a Mixed Episode, Mood Disorder
Due to a General Medical Condition, a Substance-Induced Mood Disorder, or
Bereavement (normal reaction to the death of a loved one).
 
d. Symptoms are not better accounted for by a Psychotic Disorder (e.g.,
Schizo-affective Disorder).
 
 
NOTE: The criteria for a Major Depressive Episode are set at a fairly high
threshold. At least five symptoms must occur simultaneously, and the
symptoms must be present for most of the day, nearly every day, for at
least 2 weeks. When evaluating a patient for a Major Depressive Episode,
the symptoms of depressed mood, loss of interest, psychomotor agitation or
retardation, and diminished ability to concentrate can be indicated by
either subjective account of the patient or by evidence that the symptoms
are apparent to others. Contacts with family members may be necessary to
make an accurate diagnosis.
