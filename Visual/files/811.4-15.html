<td><pre>
This multiple occurrence computed finding returns a list of
appointments for a patient in the specified date range from 
the Scheduling Package. 

The Computed Finding Parameter can be used to specify which 
appointment data fields should be returned from the Scheduling 
package and filter the results returned based on location 
and status. The Computed Finding Parameter entry uses
FLDS: to specify appointment data fields, STATUS: to filter 
specific statuses, and LL: to specify a Reminder Location List 
to filter locations.  

FLDS, STATUS, and LL are all optional and can be defined in any 
order in the computed finding parameter field.
Some examples of how to use FLDS, STATUS and/or LL:
  FLDS:1,2,16^STATUS:R^LL:DIABETIC LOCATIONS
  STATUS:CP,CC^FLDS:25
  LL:DIABETIC LOCATION

FLDS parameter information:
The appointment data fields are specified as follows:  
FLDS:F1,F2,... where F1,F2,... are any of the possible ID values
listed in the Available Appointment Data Fields table below.
The F1,F2,... ID values specify what data associated with the 
appointment will display in the clinical maintenance output. 
If no FLDS is specified, the default display fields will be 1,2
for APPOINTMENT DATE/TIME and CLINIC. 

Additionally, each F1,F2,... specified will be returned as CSUB 
data that can also be used in the computed finding's CONDITION
field. The CONDITION can be used to further screen the filtered
appointments, returned by Scheduling, by setting the USE STATUS/COND
IN SEARCH field to YES. 

For example, if you only want appointments that were checked out, 
use FLDS: 1,2,11 to get the APPOINTMENT DATE/TIME, CLINIC, and 
CHECK-OUT DATE/TIME for display purposes. The FLDS:1,2,11 will
return the CSUB data "APPOINTMENT DATE/TIME", "CLINIC" and 
"CHECK-OUT DATE/TIME".

CSUB values are used in the CONDITION field to do a comparison to
numeric or string values. Using +V causes the CSUB data to be
interpreted as numeric. Strings that cannot be converted to a
number are set to zero. For example, a CONDITION such as I
+V("CHECK-OUT DATE/TIME")&gt;0 would be true if the appointment had a
check-out date/time.

STATUS information:
STATUS: is used to set a filter on the appointment status; only
those appointments with a status that matches the STATUS: values
list will be returned. The possible values that the Scheduling
API allows are:

VALUE     Description 
--------------------------------------------------------
    R      SCHEDULED/KEPT
    I      INPATIENT
    NS     NO-SHOW
    NSR    NO-SHOW, RESCHEDULED
    CP     CANCELLED BY PATIENT
    CPR    CANCELLED BY PATIENT, RESCHEDULED
    CC     CANCELLED BY CLINIC
    CCR    CANCELLED BY CLINIC, RESCHEDULED 
    NT     NO ACTION TAKEN

If STATUS is not specified, the default is R,I.

The APPOINTMENT STATUS returned by the API is a summarized list
which does not include detailed statuses such as Future, Checked-In,
or Checked Out. These  statuses are summarized as SCHEDULED/KEPT. 
As a result, a CONDITION may be required to make sure you are
getting the correct results. For example, if you are looking for an
appointment that was kept, you would set STATUS:R combined with a
CONDITION of I (+V("OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER IEN")&gt;0)!(+V("CHECK-OUT
DATE/TIME")&gt;0) with USE STATUS/COND IN SEARCH set to YES.

LL information:
LL:Reminder Location List specifies a list of locations so that only
appointments for those locations will be returned. If LL is not
specified, then appointments for all locations will be returned.
