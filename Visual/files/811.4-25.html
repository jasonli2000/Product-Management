<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
This computed finding calls an API to the WH package that returns up to n 
number for a specific date range of Pap smear procedures found in the WH 
package that have an abnormal diagnosis.

The results from the computed finding will be returned in the Data Array; 
the format of the array is:
DATA(n,"LINK")=
DATA(n,"STATUS")=
DATA(n,"VALUE")=
DATA(n,"WVIEN")=

The data assigned to the Link subscript is a boolean value. If the value is 
a 1, then the Pap smear procedure was entered through the Radiology package.

The data assigned to the Status subscript is used to determine if the 
procedure is Open, Closed, or Pending. Pending means that the Pap smear 
procedure in the Women's Health package needs to have a result entered. Open 
means that the Pap Smear procedure has been resulted but the provider has 
not closed the case. Closed means that a result has been entered for the 
procedure and it has been closed.

The data assigned to the Value subscript is used to determine the diagnosis 
of the Pap smear procedure. The diagnosis in the Women's Health package can 
either be Normal, Abnormal, or Unsatisfactory. For this computed finding, 
the Value should always be Abnormal

The data assigned to the WVIEN subscript is the Women's Health procedure 
IEN.

The text display in the Clinical Maintenance will be found in the Text 
array.
