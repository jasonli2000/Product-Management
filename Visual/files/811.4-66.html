<td><pre>
This multi-occurrence computed finding returns a list of the ASU
User Classes that the user belongs to. The user is the person who is
running the reminder evaluation or processing a reminder dialog.
  
When a user is assigned to an ASU User Class, there can be an
Activation Date and an Expiration Date. For the purpose of this
computed finding, the date of the finding will be the Activation
Date. In those cases when there is no Activation Date, 00/00/0000
will be displayed as the date of the finding. If a Beginning
Date/Time and Ending Date/Time are used with the finding, then the 
period defined by the Activation Date and Expiration Date must
overlap the period defined by the Beginning Date/Time and the Ending
Date/Time in order for the finding to be true. When the Activation
Date is missing, a 0 will be used in its place for determining the
overlap. When the Expiration Date is missing, the evaluation date
will be used in its place for determining the overlap.
  
The Computed Finding Parameter can be used to specify either the
internal entry number or the exact name of an ASU User Class. If
this option is used, then each User Class the user is a member of is
checked to see if it is either the specified User Class or a child
of the specified User Class. Only the User Classes that pass this
test will remain on the list of the user's User Classes. For
example, if the user is a member of the user class ATTENDING 
PHYSICIAN, which is a child of the user class PHYSICIAN, and the
Computed Finding Parameter is set to "PHYSICIAN," then ATTENDING
PHYSICIAN will remain on the list. If the Computed Finding Parameter
was set to CARDIOLOGIST, then ATTENDING PHYSICIAN would be removed
since it is not a child of CARDIOLOGIST.

If you want to specify the user class as PHYSICIAN, in the computed
finding parameter field, type the following:
 COMPUTED FINDING PARAMETER:PHYSICIAN 

This computed finding uses date ranges like drug findings do, so if
the user was an active member of the class anytime during the date
range, the computed finding will be true. If you want to know if the
user is active as of today, then use T for the beginning and ending
date/time.
