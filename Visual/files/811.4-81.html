<td><pre>
This list type computed finding builds a list of patients who have
been deployed in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) or Operation Iraqi
Freedom (OIF). If the location was either OEF or OIF, but cannot be
disclosed/determined, then it is listed as unknown (UNK).
  
Date range searching is done by looking for an overlap in the
period defined by Beginning Date/Time (BDT) and Ending Date/Time
(EDT), with the period defined by OEF/OIF From and To Dates. In order
for a patient to be included on the list, there must be an overlap of
these two time periods. In other words, if patients had service
at any time in the date range specified by BDT and EDT, they will be
included.
 
The Computed Finding Parameter can be used to include only patients
who had service at a specific location. The locations can be OEF,
OIF, or ANY. The value ANY, which is the default, will include all
locations. Each location is separated by the "^" character. For
example, to include patients who had OEF, service the Computed
Finding Parameter is:
 OEF
To include patients who had either OEF or OIF service, the Computed
Finding Parameter is:
 OEF^OIF
To include patients who had UNK, service the Computed Finding Parameter is:
 UNK
