<td><pre>
This term is available for patients who have previously had an assessment
completed at an institution outside the VA system, at another VA site, or
from historic records on site that may be unavailable in the current
VistA/CPRS system (i.e. archived electronic information, or information
contained within a paper chart not in the computer system).  
 
This term is primarily used to resolve the National Hepatitis C Risk
Assessment Clinical Reminder.  However, if the patient has had a previous
positive test, previous positive diagnosis for hepatitis C disease that
has been verified, but that the computer algorithm did not capture, use
one of this terms findings (health factor, education topic,...) to resolve
the Clinical Reminder. Further, you will be given the opportunity to place
a Free text comment on where and when this previous assessment occurred
and what criteria (i.e. lab test, diagnosis) were used.  For example, if
you choose this option, you could then type into the free text section
("Previous positive Hepatitis C antibody test at St. X hospital in Local
City, State on March 2000").
