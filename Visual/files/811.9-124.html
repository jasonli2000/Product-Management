<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
The VHA recommends that PAP smear results be reviewed and that the
clinical review be documented in the patient record.
 
The main changes to this reminder for the 2013 update are:   
        Modification of the dialog to require completion of both the 
clinical review as well as the patient notification sections of the 
dialog while also making it possible for staff to use the 'Next' button 
when addressing more than one reminder.
        Addition of links in the dialog to new VHA screening guidance and 
algorithms that also include links to 2012 updated ASCCP guidelines for 
management of patients with abnormal cervical cancer screening 
results.       
 
This reminder will be due when PAP smear results are present in the
Women's Health package and are pending clinician review.
 
This reminder will be satisfied when the clinical review of PAP smear
results is recorded in the Women's Health package.

<td>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
This reminder has been developed to interface with the Women's Health (WH)
package. The associated reminder dialog will update the WH package at the
same time clinical care is recorded in CPRS GUI, thus eliminating dual
data entry and encouraging synchronization of data.  
 
Sites that use mechanisms other than the Women's Health package to 
generate letters for notifying patients of Pap results may copy the 
dialog and remove or replace the patient notification section.  If this 
is done, this reminder may still be used to trigger a clinical review of 
pap results by the clinican.
 
This reminder is recommended for use by clinicians at Primary Care Clinics
(PACT/Primary Care, Medicine, Geriatric, Women's) and any other
specialty clinics where primary care is given to female patients.
 
The reminder was developed to interface with the Women's Health package:
   * When the reminder is evaluated, PAP results pending review in the
     Women's health package will be used to determine if the reminder is
     due.
   * The VA-WH PAP SMEAR REVIEW RESULTS reminder dialog will display the
     PAP smear results and will record clinical review information in the
     current progress note and in the Women's Health package.
   * The VA-WH PAP SMEAR REVIEW RESULTS reminder dialog offers selections
     the clinician can use to document patient notification of PAP smear
     results in the Women's Health package.
 
Setup issues before using this reminder: 
     
1.  Use the Reminder Term options to map local representations of 
    findings:
     
    VA-WH PAP SMEAR PENDING REVIEW
                  No mapping necessary.  A new VA-WH PAP SMEAR PENDING
                  REVIEW computed finding will be installed with this
                  reminder term. This computed finding will make the
                  reminder due when the condition is: I V="Pending".  It
                  will then return PAP smear results pending clinician
                  review from the WH package.
 
2.  Use the Reminder Dialog edit option to define the national reminder
    dialog finding items which should be updated during CPRS GUI reminder
    processing.
 
    Review dialog elements in the national reminder dialog and change
    any national health factors to local health factors, if necessary.
    It is not unusual for local findings to be used in your national
    dialogs. Any local findings used in the national dialogs should be
    mapped to the appropriate national reminder term.  
 
3.  Alternately, use the Reminder Dialog options to copy the national 
    dialog, dialog elements, and dialog groups to make local changes.
 
    Add local dialog elements with local Order Dialogs for additional 
    ordering options for the clinicians. Some sites have clinicians 
    order a consult to a service that provides PAP smears.  If your
    site does this, copy the reminder dialog to a local reminder
    dialog and then add the local dialog element for the consult order
    to the reminder dialog so this practice can continue.
 
    Some sites have local entries in the Women's Health WV Notification
    Purpose file.  If your site does this, copy the reminder dialog to 
    a local reminder dialog, then add or modify the notifications 
    so this practice can continue.  Under reminder findings, use the new
    "WH" finding type to point to the entries.
 
4.  Use the  AEP  Add/Edit a Notification Purpose &amp; Letter manager
    option in the Women's Health package to set up entries in the WV 
    Notification Purpose file.  The breast or cervical treatment need and 
    due date should be set and the default letter text should 
    modified to explain the reason for the letter.
