<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
The VHA recommends that mammogram results be reviewed and that the
clinical review be documented in the patient record.
 
This reminder will be due when mammogram results are present in the
Women's Health package and are pending clinician review.
 
This reminder will be satisfied when the clinical review of mammogram
results is recorded in the Women's Health package.  
 
This reminder is based on VHA guidelines for Women Veterans Health and 
the Integration of Women Veterans Health with CPRS GUI project workgroup.
The workgroup reviewed materials from several sources:
 
   * Guidelines from the VA National Center for Health Promotion and
     Disease Prevention (NCHPDP) and the US Preventive Services Task 
     Force (USPSTF)
   * External Peer Review Process (EPRP)
   * Guidelines from the American Cancer Society

<td>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
This reminder has been developed to interface with the Women's Health (WH)
package. The associated reminder dialog will update the WH package at the
same time clinical care is recorded in CPRS GUI, thus eliminating dual
data entry and encouraging synchronization of data.  
 
This reminder is recommended for use by clinicians at Primary Care Clinics
(Primary Care/Medicine, GIMC, Geriatric, Women's) and any other specialty
clinics where primary care is given to female patients.  
 
The reminder was developed to interface with the Women's Health package.
   * When the reminder is evaluated, mammogram results pending review in 
     the Women's Health package will be used to determine if the reminder 
     is due.
   * The VA-WH MAMMOGRAM REVIEW RESULTS reminder dialog will display the 
     mammogram results and will record clinical review information in 
     the current progress note and in the Women's Health package.
   * The VA-WH PAP SMEAR REVIEW RESULTS reminder dialog offers selections 
     the clinician can use to document patient notification information 
     of mammogram results in the Women's Health package.
 
    During the clinical review process, clinicians will be directed to use
    the term "NEM", which stands for No Evidence of Malignancy, in place 
    of the term "Normal".
 
Setup issues before using this reminder: 
 
1.  Use the Reminder Term options to map local representations of 
    findings:
 
    VA-WH VA-WH MAMMOGRAM PENDING REVIEW
                  No mapping necessary.  New VA-WH MAMMOGRAM PENDING 
                  REVIEW  computed finding will be installed with
                  this reminder. This computed findings will make the
                  reminder due when the condition is: I V="Pending".
                  It will then return mammogram results pending
                  clinician review from the WH package.
 
2.  Use the Reminder Dialog edit option to define the national reminder
    dialog finding items which should be updated during CPRS GUI reminder
    processing.
 
    Review dialog elements in the national reminder dialog and change
    any national health factors to local health factors, if necessary.
    It is not unusual for local findings to be used in your national
    dialogs. Any local findings used in the national dialogs should be
    mapped to the appropriate national reminder term.  
 
3.  Alternately, use the Reminder Dialog options to copy the national 
    dialog, dialog elements, and dialog groups to make local changes.
            
    Add local dialog elements with local Order Dialogs for additional 
    ordering options for the clinicians. Some sites have clinicians 
    order a consult to a service that provides PAP smears.  If your
    site does this, copy the reminder dialog to a local reminder
    dialog and then add the local dialog element for the consult order
    to the reminder dialog so this practice can continue.
 
    Some sites have local entries in the Women's Health WV Notification
    Purpose file.  If your site does this, copy the reminder dialog to
    a local reminder dialog, then add or modify the notifications so
    this practice can continue.  Under reminder findings, use the new 
    "WH" finding type to point to your entries.
 
4.  Use the AEP Add/Edit a Notification Purpose &amp; Letter manager
    option in the Women's Health package to set up entries in the WV 
    Notification Purpose file.  The breast or cervical treatment need and 
    due date should be set and the default letter text should explain the
    reason for the letter.
