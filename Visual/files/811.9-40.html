Assess all patients for hepatitis C risk factors once. Patients with a

hepatitis C do not require further risk assessment.

<td>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
This reminder is based on a policy letter published by the Under Secretary
of Health (USH) in June 1998.  The USH directed that "all patients will be
evaluated with respect to risk factors" for HCV. Clinicians are required
to record this assessment in the patients' medical records.  Based on risk
factors, antibody testing should be used according to an algorithm
included in the policy letter. 
 
According to the VHA Chief Consultant for its Acute Care Strategic Health
Care Group, the USH intends that each patient seeking care in a VHA
facility will be screened for HCV risk factors.  VISN officials were
advised of this mandate.
 
BEFORE USING THIS REMINDER, sites need to use the Reminder Term
Management option to define the local findings that are used to
represent the national reminder terms:
 
   RISK FACTOR FOR HEPATITIS C
     This term is released with the health factor RISK FACTOR FOR
     HEPATITIS C.  Map any local findings that meet the intent of this
     term in the REMINDER TERM file (811.5).
 
   NO RISK FACTORS FOR HEP C
     This term is released with the health factor NO RISK FACTORS FOR HEP
     C.  Map any local findings that meet the intent of this term in the
     REMINDER TERM file (811.5).
 
   DECLINED HEP C RISK ASSESSMENT 
     This term is released with the health factor NO RISK FACTORS FOR HEP
     C.  Map any local findings that meet the intent of this term in the
     REMINDER TERM file (811.5).
 
   PREVIOUSLY ASSESSED HEP C RISK
     This term is released with the health factor PREV POSITIVE TEST FOR
     HEP C. Map any local findings that identify the patient as previously
     assessed for Hepatitis C risk factors in the REMINDER TERM file
     (811.5). This term was originally distributed as PREV POSITIVE TEST
     FOR HEP C, but was changed to provide sites with a way to identify a
     patient as previously assessed for Hepatitis C risk factors.
 
     This term will also be used to document historical positive
     tests completed outside the facility.
 
   HEP C VIRUS ANTIBODY POSITIVE
     Map local HCVAb lab tests with a condition in the REMINDER TERM file.
     An example of the condition field might be: I V="positive"
     or I (V["P")!(V["p"). The text used in the condition definition 
     (I V="text") should be based on the local LABORATORY TEST file (60)
     print codes when defined, rather than the result in the LAB DATA file
     (63).
 
   HEP C VIRUS ANTIBODY NEGATIVE
     Map local HCVAb lab tests with a condition in the REMINDER TERM file.
     An example of the condition field might be: I V="negative"
     or I (V["N")!(V["n"). The text used in the condition definition 
     (I V="text") should be based on the local LABORATORY TEST file (60)
     print codes when defined, rather than the result in the LAB DATA file
     (63).
 
   HEPATITIS C INFECTION
     This term is released with the reminder taxonomy VA-HEPATITIS C
     INFECTION.  Note:  This taxonomy can be copied. The copy can be
     modified for local changes. The changes should be limited to the data
     source, since the diagnoses are already defined. (e.g. To eliminate
     using problem list diagnosis from the findings, use the PATIENT DATA
     SOURCE field to control where to look for the HEPATITIS C INFECTION
     diagnosis.  Alternatively you can define an expiration period to
     consider the diagnosis valid.)
     Map any local findings that meet the intent of this term in the
     REMINDER TERM file (811.5).
 
Each reminder term is defined in the reminder definition with an
expiration period of 2Y, so that sites can follow-up on patient risk
assessment data that was entered prior to 10/1/98. All sites will send
risk assessment data entered from 10/1/98 through the present to the
Emerging Pathogen Initiative (EPI) database. If the most recent data for
risk assessment was prior to 10/1/98, this reminder will be due.  The data
found prior to 10/1/98 is displayed to help the clinician document an
entry for the current encounter to reflect the risk assessment information
for the patient.

   8.  Unexplained liver disease
   9.  Unexplained abnormal ALT value
  10.  Intemperate alcohol use
