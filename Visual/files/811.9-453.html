<td>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
The reminder is due for all patients.  
The reminder term for flu vaccination will need to be updated yearly to
reset the start date of the flu vaccine so that it is due each fall for
patients in the cohort no matter when they received their last
immunization.
A few weeks prior to beginning flu vaccinations each fall, change the 
start date for each finding in the vaccination term to a recent date.  For
example, if flu vaccines in the community are to begin around September
20, then change the start date to August 31 in order to be sure to allow
any entries made for Sept to resolve the reminder (entries made for
immunizations for just the month and year are recorded as MO/00/YR). The
reminder is resolved by the reminder term for flu vaccine or by the 
reminder term for contraindications.

<td>GENERAL COHORT FOUND TEXT</td>
<td><pre>
All persons should get the seasonal flu shot every year.  This vaccine 
will protect you from getting the seasonal flu in most cases. The vaccine
will also help prevent the spread of the flu to your family members.\\
 
Influenza or "flu" is a serious disease that spreads easily. It causes 
fever, chills, cough, fatigue, aches, or loss of appetite. It can lead to 
bronchitis, pneumonia or death.  Flu causes thousands of deaths each year 
in the US.  Flu shots could prevent many of these deaths.\\

<tr>
<td>GENERAL RES. NOT FOUND TEXT</td>
<td><pre>
Our records show that you have not received your seasonal flu shot for 
this year. Please get your seasonal flu shot soon or tell your primary 
care team if you already got one.
 
Everyone should get a seasonal flu shot.  Some people are at higher 
risk of serious complications from the seasonal flu:\\
*     People who are age 50 and older\\
*     Anyone with long-term health problems of the lungs, heart, or
kidney, asthma, or diabetes.\\
*     Anyone who has a weak immune system from HIV/AIDS, steroid
treatment, or cancer treatment.\\
*     Residents of nursing homes or other long-term care facilities.\\
*     Pregnant women.\\ 
 
Some flu vaccines are not recommended for people who are allergic to eggs
or who had a severe reaction to flu shot in the past.  Tell your primary
care team if you have any of these problems.  There may be a different
vaccine that you can take.  Also, tell your provider if you have a history
of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) or if you feel sick or have a high fever
on the day of your flu shot. \\
 
The flu shot or vaccine protects most people from the flu. Some may still
catch the flu after having the shot but are likely to have a milder case.
 
The flu shot does NOT cause the flu. It protects one from the flu. The
vaccine is safe and it works. Most people will not have side effects. A
few may feel sore at the site where the shot was given. Fewer may have
fever, chills, headaches, or muscle aches. The best time to get a flu shot
is in October or November. However, getting the flu shot later in December
thru March will still give very good protection. VA Clinics offer flu
shots usually from September thru March.
