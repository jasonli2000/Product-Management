<td><pre>
This reminder is set to prompt for a lipid panel every 2 years for 
patients ages 51 to 75 and every 5 years between the ages of 35 and 50 
for men and 45 and 50 for women.  Patients with diabetes (2 entries of an 
ICD code) will have the reminder due every 2 years and patients with IHD 
or atherosclerosis will have it due every one year.
 
The reminder is resolved by a local LDL in the lab package or by an 
outside LDL entered as a health factor.  The reminder term - VA-LDL - was 
exported with the IHD reminders and should already be mapped at all 
sites.

<td>GENERAL COHORT FOUND TEXT</td>
<td><pre>
Everyone should have a blood test for elevated cholesterol or blood fats 
at some time. This test measures the level of four types of lipids: total 
cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides.  \\
To prepare for this test, you should not eat or drink anything for at 
least 9 hours before blood is drawn to get a correct reading.  You may 
take your pills and drink water prior to the blood test but you should 
not have any coffee, other drinks or any food.\\
Lipids are needed by the body to promote healthy cells, make certain 
hormones, and absorb Vitamin D.  They are naturally made by the body and 
also come from food.  Abnormal lipid levels increase the risk for heart 
disease, heart attack, or stroke because of their effect on blood 
vessels.  Patients with diabetes should aim to keep their lipid levels 
within the recommended ranges. How often the blood test for lipids needs 
to be done depends on what the levels have been. What your lipid levels 
should be depends on your risk for heart disease. Talk with your primary 
care team about your blood lipid levels. 
 
The four kinds of lipids are: \\
   Low Density Lipoprotein or LDL, also known as "bad" cholesterol. The 
level should be less than 120 mg/dl in patients with heart disease or 
diabetes.  LDL at high levels can narrow, harden, or close off the walls 
of blood vessels that supply vital parts of the body such as the heart 
causing a heart attack or the brain causing a stroke. \\   High Density 
Lipoprotein or HDL, also known as "good" cholesterol. The higher the 
number the better. HDL prevents the build-up of lipids on the walls of 
blood vessels. \\   Triglycerides. High levels increase the risk of heart 
disease and stroke.\\   Total cholesterol. High levels increase the risk 
of heart disease and stroke.\\   \\
\\
There are things you can do to keep or bring lipid levels to a desired
range.\\
   Work with your provider to make a plan that will work for you.\\
   Work with your provider and dietitian to develop a healthy\\
        eating plan.\\
   Eat less food high in saturated fat or cholesterol, such as\\
        fatty portions of meat, butter, eggs, lard, shortening,\\
        foods with coconut oil or palm oil, liver, organ meats,\\
        whole milk, and ice cream. \\
   Choose lean meats, fish, and low or fat-free dairy products.\\
   Use olive, canola, corn, or sunflower oil.\\
   Eat foods high in fiber such as fruits, vegetables, and\\
        oat bran.\\   
   Keep your weight at desired levels or lose weight if you\\
        need to.\\
   Engage in a physical activity for at least 30 minutes\\
        on most days.  Check with your provider for an activity\\
        level good for you.\\
   Do not smoke cigarettes or tobacco. \\
   Keep your blood sugar controlled.\\
   Consult your provider about drinking alcohol. \\
   Talk to your provider about lipid-lowering medications that\\
        may be appropriate for you. \\
