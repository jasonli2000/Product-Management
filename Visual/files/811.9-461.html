<dt>FOUND TEXT:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Your BMI is between 25 and 30.  This means that you are likely 
carrying too much weight for your height.  Please discuss with your
primary care team any questions you have about resources available to you
to help you keep your weight down.
If you have developed weight-related health problems such as diabetes,
high blood pressure, high cholesterol, sleep apnea, or a condition called
metabolic syndrome, excess weight is an even greater risk for you.  Losing
weight may also help you in managing these weight-related health problems.

The more excess weight a person carries, the higher the risk of
health  problems. Excess weight leads to heart disease, diabetes,
high blood  pressure, stroke, some forms of cancer, osteoarthritis,
sleep apnea, lower quality of life, and shorter life expectancy.
Overweight is measured by the Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a measure of
weight for height. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered "overweight." Above
30 is considered "obese." \\
