<td><pre>
The Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs has made it a 
priority to eliminate homelessness in our Veteran population.
 
The objective of the VA-Homelessness Screening Clinical Reminder is to: 
(a) identify Veterans and their families who are at imminent risk of 
homelessness or who have very recently become homeless; (b) ensure that 
those who are at-risk or who are currently homeless are referred for the
appropriate assistance; and (c) update the current living situation for
Veterans. Information collected by the VA-Homelessness Screening reminder
will guide staff to refer Veterans for further assessment and the
appropriate intervention to prevent or quickly end homelessness.

<td>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
The reminder applies to all Veterans, EXCEPT any Veteran where one of
the following findings in the Reminder Term (Finding #1) apply: 
1. Those who have had a visit in one of the specific Stop Code Clinics
(Homelessness-related) listed in the Reminder Location List ; or 
 
2. Those who have had the Health Factor, ALREADY RECEIVING ASSIST WITH
HOUSING entered into a visit by using the corresponding option in the
dialog; or 
 
3. Those that have had a Progress Note written with a SPECIFIC Title (that
is already entered into the logic of the Computed Finding [VA-PROGRESS
NOTE]) by a provider in a NON-Homelessness Stop Code clinic, who provided
those services.
 
Entering a Beginning Date/Time of T-6M on that Reminder Term is a logic
trick to ensure that only visits in those locations, or the Specific
Health Factor, or the specific Progress Note Title IN THE PAST 6 MONTHS
are evaluated.
 
This reminder's frequency is set to 1 year, but this required somewhat
complex resolution logic so that various findings and conditions resolve
the reminder for different time frames.
 
Negative Screens result in resolution for 6 Months. This was accomplished 
by creating a Function Finding - FF(#1), that sets the frequency.
 
 ---- Begin: FF(1) ----------------------------------------------
              Function String: MAX_DATE(3,5)'&lt;MAX_DATE(2,4) 
     Expanded Function String: 
      MAX_DATE(POSITIVE - HAS WORRIES ABOUT HOUSING, 
      POSITIVE - HAS NO STABLE HOUSING)'&lt;MAX_DATE(
      NEGATIVE - HAS STABLE HOUSING,NEGATIVE - HAS NO HOUSING CONCERNS)
          Match Frequency/Age: 6 months for all ages 
                   Found Text: Positive Screen more recent than Negative
                   Screen. Frequency changed to 6M.
 ---- End: FF(1) ----------------------------------------------
 
Finding #9 - NURSING HOME RESIDENT - resolves the reminder for 2 years 
(Frequency set on that finding, but Beginning Date/Time set to T-2Y, so 
that after 2 years, the finding no longer applies, and normal frequency 
(1Y) applies), until and if that living arrangement is documented again.
 
Findings #2 &amp; #4 - NEGATIVE - HAS STABLE HOUSING and NEGATIVE - HAS NO 
HOUSING CONCERNS - are BOTH Required for Negative Screen. If BOTH are
found, the reminder is resolved for 1 year, but if 3 consecutive screens
are negative, and the Computed Finding that looks at the Reminder
Definition VA-HOMELESSNESS FREQUENCY 2Y is evaluated as TRUE, it is
resolved for 2 years.
 
A Positive Screen (Finding #5 - POSITIVE - HAS NO STABLE HOUSING; or
Finding #3 -POSITIVE - HAS WORRIES ABOUT HOUSING ) resolves for 6 months,
as does documenting UNABLE TO PERFORM HOMELESS SCREEN (Finding #7).
 
Finding #6 (Declines Homeless Screen) Resolves for 1 year.
                                 
Customized RESOLUTION LOGIC defines findings that resolve the Reminder:
 FI(9)!(FI(2)&amp;FI(4))!FI(6)!FI(3)!FI(5)!FI(7)
 
Expanded Resolution Logic:
 FI(NURSING HOME RESIDENT)!(FI(NEGATIVE - HAS STABLE HOUSING)&amp;
 FI(NEGATIVE - HAS NO HOUSING CONCERNS))!FI(DECLINES HOMELESS SCREEN)!
 FI(POSITIVE - HAS WORRIES ABOUT HOUSING)!
 FI(POSITIVE - HAS NO STABLE HOUSING)!
 FI(UNABLE TO PERFORM HOMELESS SCREEN)
