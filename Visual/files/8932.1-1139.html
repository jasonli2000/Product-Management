<td><pre>
Occupational therapists work with older adults in virtually every 
setting: assisted living, wellness programs, hospitals, nursing homes, 
senior centers, clinics and in the home. Occupational therapists bring an 
understanding of the importance of participation and occupation for 
overall well-being to those who are experiencing disabling conditions 
related to aging. The primary overarching goal of occupational therapy 
services with this population is to maximize independence and 
participation, thereby enabling an older person to continue to live 
successfully in his or her chosen environment. Occupational therapists 
can help older adults by developing strategies to help or maintain safety 
and well-being, to assist with life transitions, and to compensate for 
challenges they experience in activities of daily living, instrumental 
activities of daily living, leisure participation, social participation, 
and productive activities.
