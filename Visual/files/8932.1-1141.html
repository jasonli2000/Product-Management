<td><pre>
Occupational therapists are experts at helping people lead as independent 
a life as possible. Occupational therapists bring an understanding of the 
physical and psychological implications of illness and injury and their 
effects on peoples' ability to perform the tasks of daily living. 
Occupational therapists provide interventions that can aide a person in 
completing ADL and IADL tasks, such as dressing, bathing, preparing 
meals, and driving. They also may fabricate custom orthotics to improve 
function, evaluate the environment for safety hazards and recommend 
adaptations to remove those hazards, help a person compensate for 
cognitive changes, and build a persons' physical endurance and strength. 
Occupational therapists' knowledge of adapting tasks and modifying the 
environment to compensate for functional limitations is used to increase 
the involvement of clients and to promote safety and success.
