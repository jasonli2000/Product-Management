<td><pre>
Occupational therapy practitioners are experts at identifying the cause 
of difficulties in performance of activities of daily living and 
instrumental activities of daily living. Occupational therapy 
practitioners evaluate the client, their environment, and their 
occupational performance in that environment, as well as make 
recommendations for products to improve the fit between the client, 
place, and activity. Occupational therapists can evaluate both the skills 
of the client and the environmental features that support or limit the 
performance of meaningful or necessary activities, thereby enhancing 
health, safety and well-being. Based on this assessment, they recommend 
modification and intervention strategies that improve the fit between the 
person and his or her environment.
