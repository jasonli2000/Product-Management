<td><pre>
Occupational therapists provide interventions to clients of all ages with 
feeding, eating and swallowing difficulties. Occupational therapists 
provide comprehensive rehabilitative, habilitative, and palliative 
dysphagia care, which includes collaborating with clients to provide 
individualized compensatory swallowing strategies, modified diet 
textures, adapted mealtime environments, enhanced feeding skills, 
preparatory exercises and positioning to clients, reinforcement of 
mealtime strategies to enhance and improve swallowing skills, and 
training to caregivers to enhance eating and feeding performance. 
Occupational therapists provide screening and in-depth clinical 
assessment which may include instrumental dysphagia assessments including 
videofluroscopy.
