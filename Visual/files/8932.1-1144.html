<td><pre>
Occupational therapists enable children and adults with visual impairment 
to engage in their chosen daily living activities safely and as 
independently as possible. This is accomplished by 1) teaching the person 
to use their remaining vision as efficiently as possible to complete 
activities; (2) modifying activities so that they can be completed with 
less vision; (3) training the person in use of adaptive equipment to 
compensate for vision loss, including high and low technology assistive 
devices; and (4) modifying the person's environment.
