<td>DEFINITION</td>
<td><pre>
Occupational therapy assistants contribute to the completion of an 
individualized occupational therapy driving and community mobility 
evaluation by administering delegated assessments and identifying 
findings that impact the client's occupational performance. Clients 
engage in the assessment and occupational profile process to customize 
the evaluation to their individual driving and community mobility needs. 
Occupational therapy assistants administer and continuously modify 
individualized in-vehicle and community mobility assessments within the 
naturalistic context of the community in response to the occupational 
performance and safety behaviors of the client. They also implement an 
individualized intervention plan, within the parameters established in 
collaboration with the occupational therapist that reflects the contexts 
of the client and meets his or her occupational performance and safety 
needs. Occupational therapy assistants address immediate and long-term 
implications of psychosocial issues related to compromised driving and 
community mobility throughout the occupational therapy process and makes 
recommendations to the occupational therapist for modification to service 
delivery.
