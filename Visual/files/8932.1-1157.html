Phlebology is the medical discipline that involves the diagnosis and 
treatment of venous disorders, including spider veins, varicose veins, 
chronic venous insufficiency, venous leg ulcers, congenital venous 
abnormalities, venous thromboembolism and other disorders of venous 
origin. A phlebologist has attained a minimum of 50 hours of CME units in 
phlebology-related courses, and is knowledgeable of and trained in a 
variety of diagnostic techniques including physical examination, venous 
imaging techniques such as duplex ultrasound, CT and MR, plethysmographic 
techniques and laboratory evaluation related to venous thromboembolism. 
The phlebologist is also trained in a variety of therapeutic 
interventions, which may include compression, sclerotherapy, cutaneous 
vascular laser, endovenous thermoablation procedures (laser and 
radiofrequency) endovenous chemical ablation, surgical procedures (e.g., 
ambulatory phlebectomy, venous ligation), vasoactive medications and the 
management of venous thromboembolism.   Source: American College of
