<td>DEFINITION</td>
<td><pre>
A pathologist deals with the causes and nature of disease and contributes 
to diagnosis, prognosis and treatment through knowledge gained by the 
laboratory application of the biologic, chemical and physical sciences. A 
pathologist uses information gathered from the microscopic examination of 
tissue specimens, cells and body fluids, and from clinical laboratory 
tests on body fluids and secretions for the diagnosis, exclusion and 
monitoring of disease.   Source: American Board of Medical Specialties,

This taxonomy code identifies the combined anatomic "clinical pathology 
only" route. Board Certification for Medical Doctors (MDs) is provided by 
the American Board of Pathology. To acknowledge the diverse activities in 
the practice of pathology and to accommodate the interests of individuals 
wanting to enter the field, the ABP offers primary certification through 
the following three routes: combined anatomic pathology and clinical 
pathology, anatomic pathology only and clinical pathology only. Primary 
certification in anatomic pathology or clinical pathology may be combined 
with some of the subspecialty certifications.
