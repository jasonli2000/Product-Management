<td>DEFINITION</td>
<td><pre>
A medical or mental health professional who has attained credentials 
after satisfactorily completing a poetry therapy training program 
approved by the National Federation for Biblio/Poetry Therapy (NFBPT). 
Training includes didactic work, peer group experience, and supervised 
practicum.  An NFBPT credentialed certified poetry therapist (CPT) or 
registered poetry therapist (PTR) integrates discussion of published 
literature and reflective or creative writing into the psychotherapeutic 
process to achieve goals of emotional well-being, symptom reduction, and 
improved interpersonal communication.  Certified poetry therapists and 
registered poetry therapists are licensed mental health professionals 
with advanced training in the theory and practice of poetry therapy. CPTs 
and PTRs are qualified to work independently with emotionally troubled 
populations in clinical, rehabilitative, community and educational 
institutions. They also work with emotionally healthy individuals 
adjusting to developmental issues, life crises, or disabilities. The PTR 
completes an advanced level of training and fieldwork, commensurate with 
the highest levels of clinical practice. The terms poetry therapy, 
applied poetry facilitation, journal therapy, bibliotherapy, 
biblio/poetry therapy, and poetry/journal therapy reflect the interactive 
use of literature and/or writing to promote personal growth and emotional 
healing. In addition to poetry, poetry therapy applies all forms or 
written and spoken language including story, myth, folk and fairy tale 
and other genres of poetic expression as well as journal, memoir, and 
narrative. The poetry therapy process integrates discussion of published 
literature and reflective or creative writing for expression and 
communication of thoughts and feelings to facilitate participants' 
emotional well-being. The field of poetry therapy encompasses all of 
these modalities, though only a duly trained and licensed clinical 
practitioner can be credentialed as CPT or PTR.
