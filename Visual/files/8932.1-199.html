<td>DEFINITION</td>
<td><pre>
Chiropractic Orthopedics is defined as that branch of chiropractic 
medicine that includes the continued acquisition of knowledge relative to 
both normal functions and diseases of the human body as they relate to 
the bones, joints, capsules, discs, muscles, ligaments, tendons, their 
complete neurological and vascular components, referred organ systems and 
contiguous tissues. This also includes the development and perfection of 
skills relative to health maintenance when such exists and when not, the 
investigations, historical review, physical detection, correlative 
diagnosis development and complete management of any disorder within the 
bounds defined herein. Also necessary is the delivery of the combined 
knowledge and skill on a primary basis to patients who both need and 
desire this service to the eventual outcome of remissions, whenever 
resolution is not readily achievable. In addition the certified 
chiropractic orthopedist provides consultation services at the request of 
other qualified doctors seeking assistance in the care of their patients. 
The chiropractic orthopedist may also engage in the teaching and or 
research of subjects and materials relevant to pursuing the quest for 
knowledge in the ever changing field of the orthopedic specialty.
