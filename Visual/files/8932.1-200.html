<td><pre>
Chiropractic radiology is a referral specialty that provides consultation 
services at the request of other qualified doctors. Chiropractic 
radiologists provide consultation in health care facilities (private 
offices, hospitals and teaching institutions) to meet the needs of 
referring doctors and their patients. The quality of the consultative 
services by the chiropractic radiologist in independent practice is 
reflected by the quality of their professional credentials. Chiropractic 
radiologists recommend, supervise, and interpret radiologic studies as 
well as advanced imaging procedures. They advise referring physicians on 
the necessity and appropriateness of radiologic services and whether to 
select or to avoid certain diagnostic or clinical procedures. In some 
instances the radiologist may act as a private practitioner. They may 
conduct research and apply diagnostic radiologic procedures and may be 
called upon to act as expert witnesses in matters of litigation. 
 
Chiropractic radiologists are also concerned with imaging technology 
including image production, demonstration of normal and abnormal anatomy, 
and the interaction of energy and matter. The advances in the 
technological facets of radiology are so rapid that only qualified 
radiologists can reasonably be expected to maintain the high level of 
proficiency required to supervise and interpret these procedures. The 
practice of radiology continuously involves the application of this 
technology to patient imaging and treatment. 
 
It is now well recognized that chiropractic radiology includes, but is 
not limited to, plain film radiography, fluoroscopy, tomography, 
ultrasonography, radioisotope imaging, computed tomography, digital 
radiography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Individual practices may 
vary by intent, licensure, and scope of practice laws.
