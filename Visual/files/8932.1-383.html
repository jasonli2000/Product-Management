(1) Physical therapists are health care professionals who evaluate and 
treat people with health problems resulting from injury or disease. 
PT&amp;apos;s assess joint motion, muscle strength and endurance, function of 
heart and lungs, and performance of activities required in daily living, 
among other responsibilities. Treatment includes therapeutic exercises, 
cardiovascular endurance training, and training in activities of daily 
living. (2) A physical therapist is a person qualified by an accredited 
program in physical therapy, licensed by the state, and practicing within 
the scope of that license. Physical therapists treat disease, injury, or 
loss of a bodily part by physical means, such as the application of 
light, heat, cold, water, electricity, massage and exercise. They develop 
treatment plans based upon each patient&amp;apos;s strengths, weaknesses, 
range of motion and ability to function. (3) A health professional who 
specializes in physical therapy- the health care field concerned 
primarily with the treatment of disorders with physical agents and 
methods, such as massage, manipulation, therapeutic exercises, cold, heat 
(including short-wave, microwave, and ultrasonic diathermy), 
hydrotherapy, electric stimulation and light to assist in rehabilitating 
patients and in restoring normal function after an illness or injury.
