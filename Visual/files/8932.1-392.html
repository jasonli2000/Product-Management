procedures and related tasks that have been selected and delegated by the 
supervising physical therapist. Duties of the PTA include assisting the 
physical therapist in implementing treatment programs, training patients 
in exercised and activities of daily living, conducting treatments, and 
reporting to the physical therapist on the patient&amp;apos;s responses. In 
addition to direct patient care, the PTA may also perform such functions 
as patient transport, and clinic or equipment preparation and 
maintenance. Currently more than half of all states require PTAs to be 
licensed, registered or certified. (2) An individual who works under the
