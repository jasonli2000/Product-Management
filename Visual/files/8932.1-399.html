<td><pre>
An occupational therapist is a person who has graduated from an 
entry-level occupational therapy program accredited by the Accreditation 
Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE) or predecessor 
organizations, or approved by the World Federation of Occupational 
Therapists (WFOT), or an equivalent international occupational therapy 
education program; has successfully completed a period of supervised 
fieldwork experience required by the occupational therapy program; has 
passed a nationally recognized entry-level examination for occupational 
therapists, and fulfills state requirements for licensure, certification, 
or registration. An occupational therapist provides interventions based 
on evaluation and which emphasize the therapeutic use of everyday life 
activities (i.e., occupations) with individuals or groups for the purpose 
of facilitating participation in roles and situations and in home, 
school, workplace, community and other settings. Occupational therapy 
services are provided for the purpose of promoting health and wellness 
and are provided to those who have or are at risk for developing an 
illness, injury, disease, disorder, condition, impairment, disability, 
activity limitation, or participation restriction. Occupational 
therapists address the physical, cognitive, psychosocial, sensory, and 
other aspects of occupational performance in a variety of contexts to 
support engagement in everyday life activities that affect health, 
well-being, and quality of life.
