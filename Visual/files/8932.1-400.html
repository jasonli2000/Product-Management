<td><pre>
An occupational therapy assistant is a person who has graduated from an 
occupational therapy assistant program accredited by the Accreditation 
Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE) or predecessor 
organizations, has successfully completed a period of supervised 
fieldwork experience required by the accredited occupational therapy 
assistant program, has passed a nationally recognized entry-level 
examination for occupational therapy assistants, and fulfills state 
requirements for licensure, certification, or registration. An 
occupational therapy assistant provides interventions under the 
supervision of an occupational therapist which emphasize the therapeutic 
use of everyday life activities (i.e., occupations) with individuals or 
groups for the purpose of facilitating participation in roles and 
situations and in home, school, workplace, community and other settings. 
Occupational therapy services are provided for the purpose of promoting 
health and wellness and are provided to those who have or are at risk for 
developing an illness, injury, disease, disorder, condition, impairment, 
disability, activity limitation, or participation restriction. 
Occupational therapy assistants address the physical, cognitive, 
psychosocial, sensory, and other aspects of occupational performance in a 
variety of contexts to support engagement in everyday life activities 
that affect health, well-being, and quality of life.
