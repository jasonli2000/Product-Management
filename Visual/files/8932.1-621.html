<td><pre>
Occupational therapists provide services to infants, toddlers and 
children who have or who are at risk for developmental delays or 
disabilities. Occupational therapy is concerned with a child's ability to 
participate in daily life activities or "occupations." Occupational 
therapists use their unique expertise to help children with 
social-emotional, physical, cognitive, communication, and adaptive 
behavioral challenges and to help children to be prepared for and perform 
important learning and school-related activities and to fulfill their 
rule as students. Through an understanding of the impact of disability, 
illness, and impairment on a child's development, plan, ability to learn 
new skills, and overall occupational performance, occupational therapists 
design interventions that promote healthy development, establish needed 
skills, and/or modify environments, all in support of participation in 
daily activities.
