Occupational therapists can optimize and prolong an older driver's 
ability to drive safely and ease the transition to other forms of 
transportation if driving cessation becomes necessary. By identifying 
strengths as well as physical or cognitive challenges, occupational 
therapists can evaluate an individual's overall ability to operate a 
vehicle safely and recommend assistive devices or behavioral changes to 
limit risks. Occupational therapy practitioners offer a continuum of 
services related to community mobility, from evaluation of driving 
performance, through counseling and support for lifestyle changes, to 
maintaining independence and quality of life.
