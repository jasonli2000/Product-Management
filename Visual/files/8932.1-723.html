<td>DEFINITION</td>
<td><pre>
(1) An individual educated and trained in clinical chemistry, 
microbiology or other biological sciences; and in gathering data on the 
blood, tissues, and fluids in the human body. Tests and procedures 
performed or supervised center on major areas of hematology, 
microbiology, immunohematology, immunology, clinical chemistry and 
urinalysis. Education and certification requires the equivalent of an 
associate degree and alternative combinations of accredited training and 
experience. (2) A specially trained individual who works under the 
direction of a pathologist, other physician, or scientist, and performs 
specialized chemical, microscopic, and bacteriological tests of human 
blood, tissue, and fluids. Also known as medical technologists, they 
perform and supervise tests and procedures in clinical chemistry, 
immunology, serology, bacteriology, hematology, parasitology, mycology, 
urinalysis, and blood banking. The work requires the correlation of test 
results with other data, interpretation of test findings, and exercise of 
independent judgment. The minimum educational requirement (for one of 
several certification programs in medical technology) is a baccalaureate 
degree with appropriate science course requirements, plus a twelve-month, 
structured, AMA approved medical technology program and an examination; 
or a baccalaureate degree with appropriate science course requirements 
and experience.
