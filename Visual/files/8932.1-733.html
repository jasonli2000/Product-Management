<td><pre>
Midwifery practice as conducted by certified nurse-midwives (CNMs) and 
certified midwives (CMs) is the independent management of women's health 
care, focusing particularly on pregnancy, childbirth, the post partum 
period, care of the newborn, and the family planning and gynecologic 
needs of women. The CNM and CM practice within a health care system that 
provides for consultation, collaborative management, or referral, as 
indicated by the health status of the client. CNMs and CMs practice in 
accord with the Standards for the Practice of Midwifery, as defined by 
the American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM).

The American Midwifery Certification Board, Inc. [AMCB, formerly the ACNM 
Certification Council, Inc. (ACC)] opened its national certification exam 
to non-nurse graduates of midwifery education programs and issued the 
first certified midwife (CM) credential in 1997. Certified midwives are 
educated to meet the same high standards that certified nurse-midwives 
must meet. These are the standards that every state in the U.S. has 
recognized as the legal basis for nurse-midwifery practice. All education 
programs for CMs, like CNMs, award a post-baccalaureate certificate or 
higher degree. CMs take the same AMCB certification exam as CNMs and 
study side by side with nurse-midwifery students in some education 
programs. As an organization, ACNM supports efforts to legally recognize 
CMs as qualified midwifery practitioners granted the same rights and 
responsibilities as CNMs.
