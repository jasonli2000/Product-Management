<td>DEFINITION</td>
<td><pre>
A pediatrician who is responsible for continuous care in the field of 
sports medicine, not only for the enhancement of health and fitness, but 
also for the prevention of injury and illness. A sports medicine 
physician must have knowledge and experience in the promotion of wellness 
and the prevention of injury. Knowledge about special areas of medicine 
such as exercise physiology, biomechanics, nutrition, psychology, 
physical rehabilitation, epidemiology, physical evaluation, injuries 
(treatment and prevention and referral practice) and the role of exercise 
in promoting a healthy lifestyle are essential to the practice of sports 
medicine. The sports medicine physician requires special education to 
provide the knowledge to improve the healthcare of the individual engaged 
in physical exercise (sports) whether as an individual or in team 
participation.   Source: American Board of Medical Specialties, 2007.
