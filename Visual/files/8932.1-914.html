<td><pre>
Legal Medicine is a special field of medicine that focuses on various 
aspects of medicine and law. Historically, the practice of legal medicine 
made contributions to medicine as a scientific instrument to solve 
criminal perplexities. Since World War II, the domain of legal medicine 
has broadened to include not only aspects of medical science to solve 
legal and criminal problems but aspects of law as it applies to medicine. 
Legal Medicine continues to grow as medicolegal issues like medical 
malpractice and liability, government regulation of health care, issues 
of tort reform, and moral and ethical complexities presented by 
technological advances become increasingly prominent. Many medical 
schools have implemented courses which supply medicolegal instruction for 
medical students, and many law schools now offer medicolegal courses. 
Also, dual degree programs in law and medicine have been created to 
assist physicians to bridge the gap between medicine and the law.
