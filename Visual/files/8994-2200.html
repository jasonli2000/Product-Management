<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The value of this parameter is a string.
This string is a DICOM UID (unique identifier) that specifies
the study for which the image information is to be retrieved.
 
A DICOM UID is a string consisting of only digits and periods,
and may be up to 64 characters long.

<dt>INPUT PARAMETER:  &nbsp;&nbsp;PRMUID</dt>
<dt>PARAMETER TYPE:  &nbsp;&nbsp;LITERAL</dt>
<dt>MAXIMUM DATA LENGTH:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1</dt>
<dt>REQUIRED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;NO</dt>
<dt>SEQUENCE NUMBER:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2</dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The primary UID flag determines what type of error checks will be
performed on the UID provided.
 
There are two UID checks that may be performed depending on the value
of the primary UID flag.
 
A duplicate UID check can be performed which will check to see if 
the PACS UID is associated with multiple patients. If duplicate
UIDs are found a "-13" error message will be returned.
 
A multiple UID check can be performed which will check to see if
the PACS UID is associated with multiple entries in the IMAGE
(#2005) file. If multiple UIDs are found a "-14" error will
be returned.
 
A PRMUID value of 0 will perform a duplicate and multiple
UID check.
 
A PRMUID value of 1 will perform neither a duplicate nor multiple
UID check.
 
A PRMUID value of 2 will perform a duplicate UID check, but
will not perform a multiple UID check.
