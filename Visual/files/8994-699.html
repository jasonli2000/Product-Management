<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
After viewing unsigned orders for a patient via an alert, evaluates
whether the alert should be deleted for the current user.
 
The following two exception conditions exist when determining how alert
deletion will occur.  In all other cases, alert deletion will occur when
the patient has no unsigned orders.
 
1)      If the recipient of this alert does NOT have the ORES key, the
alert will be deleted for that recipient after he reviews the unsigned
orders. 
 
2)      If the recipient has the ORES key and is NOT linked to the patient
as attending, inpatient primary provider or via OE/RR teams, his alert
will be deleted when his unsigned orders are signed.  (If unsigned orders
written by other providers for the patient remain, alerts for these other 
providers will not be deleted.)  For example, a consulting surgeon (with
ORES) places three unsigned orders for a patient.  He then receives an
"Order requires electronic signature" alert for the patient.  He uses the 
View Alerts follow-up action and is presented with ten unsigned orders for
the patient.  Only three of the ten orders are his.  The surgeon signs his
three unsigned orders.  If the surgeon is not linked to the patient as
attending, inpatient primary providers or via OE/RR teams, the alert will 
be deleted (for him only.)  
 
In most cases alert deletion will occur when the patient has no unsigned
orders.  For example, if a recipient has the ORES key and is linked to the
patient as attending, inpatient primary provider or via OE/RR teams, all
unsigned orders for the patient must be signed before his alert is
deleted.
