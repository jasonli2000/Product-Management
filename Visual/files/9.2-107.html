There are two factors which influence how VA FileMan will control access to
files.  First is the FileMan Access Code, DUZ(0).  If this variable is set
to the programmer's at-sign (@), VA FileMan will allow complete file access.
If it is set to anything else, VA FileMan will use the 'Accessible File'
specifications in the User File to grant varying levels of file access.
But, as usual, for access to fields or templates, VA FileMan will check the
user's DUZ(0) character string for a match.
 
Use of options, though, does not concern the user's specific file access
except when VA FileMan is called.  Options that provide editing of word
processing fields are calling VA FileMan's text editor.  Options that
reference other files may navigate via VA FileMan.  If so, access to the
files will be monitored as VA FileMan checks the user's file access.
 
In any file access attempt by a user without DUZ(0)=@, VA FileMan first
checks that read access is allowed.  If so, data values may be displayed.
Read access will also permit use of VA FileMan's 'Transfer' capability as
an edit option within word processing fields.  Write access will allow the
changing of data values. 
 
Adding new entries or navigation to a pointed-to file are controlled by
laygo access.  If a pointing field allows laygo, as specified in the data
dictionary, and the pointed-to file also allows laygo, the user won't need
explicit file access.  If the pointed-to file is protected, however, the
user will need to have been permitted laygo access to the file.  Delete
access would be checked at the moment the user tried to delete a file entry.
 
When coding calls, if DIC(0) contains an 'L', DIC will allow the user to
add a new entry if one of three conditions are met:
 
 - the user has been granted laygo access to the file.
 
 - the user's DUZ(0) is equal to '@', or
 
 - the variable DLAYGO is defined equal to the file number.
