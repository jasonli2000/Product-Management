                         Using NOIS in a Workgroup
 
Who supports what sites, packages, or systems is not always the same from
ISC to ISC or from day to day.  To allow for variations in organizational
structure and changing events (changes in staff, vacations, training, site
visits, projects, etc.), the NOIS software is very flexible.
 
NOIS is user-oriented and allows working in groups without imposing an
organizational structure.
 
NOIS is maintained by its own users.  Users can review and act on the
calls they are responsible for.
 
Calls can be grouped to meet your needs.
 
Calls can be grouped that reflect a group of individuals (site
specialists, package specialists, package development) that remain within
the boundaries of an ISC or cross over ISCs, EPs, or sites.
 
Supervisors can define other users lists, defaults, and notifications.
 They can also use NOIS to easily monitor what problems are being taken
care of and what arent.
 
Mailgroups can be used for sending notifications on calls.
 
Users can know of other users involved on a call by using the Other
Information action on the edit screen.  This shows what lists this call is
on (with the lists owner and functional area) and users that have
notifications.
 
Support sections need to organize such that calls are directed to the
appropriate person.
 
Development is involved in calls referred to them and can take appropriate
action.
