This LEDI Order Test Mapping option is used to identify where the data
is in File 60, so the HL7 messages can be created and the report can be
sent to the collecting lab.  This option must be completed for all tests
that a lab performs as the "Host Site" in order for the report to be 
transferred to HL7 messages.  
  
The first step of the option is to choose which Lab Subscript area the
test is located in. (MI for Microbiology, SP for Surgical Pathology and
CY for Cytology).  
  
The second step is to choose the local Laboratory Test Name (File #60).  
 
The third step is to choose the associated National VA Lab Code for that
test (File 64 entry).  Once a valid National VA Lab Code is chosen - the
system will ask if the user wants to link the File 60 entry to the File 
#64 entry.  It is strongly recommended to link the entries so that the
associated name fields will be activated allowing easier lookups of the
tests in the future.  
  
The last choice is to choose the report format for the lab test that will
be accepted for LEDI transmission. This is called the MI/AP Database Code
(File #64.061).  This code must contain the same lab area subscript as 
well as the words "Rpt Date" in the name field of the Database code 
(ex: MI Gram Stain Rpt Date).  
  
The test can now be reported electronically  via HL7 messaging through 
the LEDI interface with other labs.  
  
 Example of the screens involved: 
 
  
      Select one of the following: 
  
           MI        Microbiology 
           SP        Surgical Pathology 
           CY        Cytopathology 
  
Choose Lab Area Subscript: MI  Microbiology 
Enter Laboratory Test Name: GRAM
 STAIN       GRAM ST NATIONAL VA LAB CODE: Gram Stain// 
60 = GRAM STAIN 
64 = Gram Stain   87754.0000 
     
   Link the two entries? No// Y  (Yes) 
                                 o----LINKED----o 
  
      MI/AP Database Code for this test is 
        MI Gram Stain Rpt Date [9194] 
 
Do you want to keep this mapping? y  YES
