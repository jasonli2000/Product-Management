As an authorized user of VHA automated information systems (AISs) and
having access to data stored in them, I will be given sufficient access to
perform my assigned duties.  I will use this access ONLY for its intended
purpose and understand the following policies that apply to VA data and
computer systems:
 
I agree to safeguard all passwords (e.g., Access/Verify codes, electronic
signature codes) assigned to me and am strictly prohibited from disclosing these
codes to anyone including family, friends, fellow workers, supervisor(s), and
subordinates for ANY reason.
 
I understand that I may be held accountable for all entries/changes made
to any government AIS using my passwords.
 
I am aware of the regulations and facility AIS security policies designed
to ensure the confidentiality of all sensitive information.  I am aware
that information about patients or employees is confidential and
protected from unauthorized disclosure by law.  I understand that my
obligation to protect VA information does not end with either the
termination of my access to this facility's systems or with the
termination of my government employment.
 
I will exercise common sense and good judgment in the use of electronic
mail.  I understand that electronic mail is not inherently confidential
and I have no expectation of privacy in using it.  I understand that
technical or administrative problems may create situations which requires
viewing of my messages.  I also understand that facility management
officials may authorize access to my electronic mail messages whenever
there is a legitimate purpose for such access.
 
I understand that a violation of this notice constitutes disregard of a
local and/or VHA policy and will result in appropriate disciplinary action
as defined in VA employee conduct Regulations (VAR 820(b)) as well as
suspension/termination of access privileges.
 
I affirm with my signature that I have read, understand, and agree to
fulfill the provisions of this User Access notice.
