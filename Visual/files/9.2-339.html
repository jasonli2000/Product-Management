The merge process really begins when two records are Verified as
Duplicates.  When two records are verified as duplicates the operator
is asked which record they wish to merge to the other record (the From
and To records).  After the From record is established the following
steps occur:
 
The packages that have a file entry for the 'Affects Record Merge'
are first checked to see if they have data for the From record which
is being merged.  If they do have data they are then checked to see
if they have their own special merge routine or if an interactive
special merge process has to occur for them.  This is done for all
packages.
 
If none of the packages have an interactive merge (which means the
main merge has to wait until that packages merge has taken place)
the merge process will continue.  If there is an interactive merge
process that has to occur for a particular package a bulletin will
be sent to all members of the Verified Duplicate Mail Group notifying
them about the records that have been identified as Verified duplicates.
 
Once all the package interactive merge processes have been completed
the two records will be merged and a Merged Bulletin sent to all them
members of the Merged Mail Group.
