                DELETE INTERVENTION
 
The DELETE INTERVENTION option is used to delete a Pharmacy 
Intervention that was made in error.  You may only delte a intervention that 
was entered on the same day that you are deleting.  The option appears on the 
INTM (Pharmacy Intervention Menu) menu as:
 
        DINT   Delete Intervention
 
You can choose the option by entering DINT at the
 
        Select Pharmacy Intervention Menu option:
 
prompt.
 
You will be asked for the Intervention Date, however it is much easier to put 
in the patient's chart number or the patient's name in the usual manner.  In the 
example we will first enter a date that is in the past and you will see that the 
computer will not allow you to delete one in the past.
