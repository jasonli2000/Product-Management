                PRINT PHARMACY INTERVENTION
 
The PRINT PHARMACY INTERVENTION option is used to print a report 
by date range of all the interventions sorted by the intervention type or what 
the reason for the intervention was.  The option appears on the INTM 
(Pharmacy Intervention Menu) menu as:
 
        PINT   Print Pharmacy Intervention
 
You can choose this option by entering PINT at the
 
        Select Pharmacy Intervention Menu option:
 
prompt.
 
First you enter the date range of the report by entering the start and go to 
dates.  You may enter the standard Fileman formats for the dates.
 
  START WITH INTERVENTION DATE: FIRST// T-120
  GO TO INTERVENTION DATE: LAST// T
 
Next you enter the device to print the report on.  It is always recommended to 
enter a 'Q' to queue the report for some later time after the clinic or hospital is 
not as busy.  You cannot queue a report to your terminal or to a slave printer.
 
DEVICE: 
 
The report will print out sorted by the type of Intervention over a date range.  
You will get a subcount and total count for the interventions.  The subtotal and 
total will give you the number of interventions that your recommendation was 
accepted while the subcount and count will give you the number of 
interventions of each type and the total number of interventions over the 
specified date range.
 
The following is an example of printing a Pharmacy Intervention report.
