<td><pre>
MILD:  Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the
    diagnosis.  Symptoms result in only minor impairment in occuptional
    functioning or in usual social activities or relationships with
    others.
     
MODERATE:  Symptoms or functional impairment between "mild" and 
    "severe".
    
SEVERE:  Several symptoms in excess of those required to make the
    diagnosis.  Symptoms markedly interfere with occupational
    functioning or with usual social activities or relationships
    with others.
    
IN PARTIAL REMISSION OR RESIDUAL STATE:  The full criteria for the
    disorder were previously met, but currently only some of the
    symptoms or signs of the illness are present.  In partial
    remission should be used when there is expectation that the
    person will completely recover (or have a complete remission)
    within the next few years, as, for example, in the case of a
    Major Depressive Episode.  Residual state should be used when
    the next few years, as, for example, in the case of Autistic
    Disorder or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  (Residual
    state should not be used with Schizophrenia, since by tradition
    there is a specific residual type of Schizophrenia.)  In some
    cases the distinction between in partial remission and residual
    state will be difficult to make.
    
IN FULL REMISSION:  There are no longer any symptoms or signs of the
    disorder.  The differentiation of in full remission from
    recovered (no current mental disorder) requires consideration
    of the length of time since the last period of disturbance, and
    the need for continued evaluation or prophylactic treatment.
