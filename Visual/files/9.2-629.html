If is seems likely that an initialism or acronym is the offical
title of a journal, it is recommended that you use this as the first
search strategy, especially for current titles.  Initialisms and
acronyms are not often found on older journals; they are a fairly
recent trend.
  
If the initialism/acronym is not the official title but is prominent
on the cover, it will be present in the SYNONYM field, which has
been cross-indexed so that it will find the correct official title.
  
Bibliographic information entered in the fields for GENERAL NOTES,
FIRST ISSUE, LAST ISSUE, FORMERLY, and CONTINUED BY will give the
specific details of the history of the title.  Most titles have 
undergone some name changes.  A library with 15 to 20 years of a
journal may well have to list it under several titles in order to
present an accurate history of its holdings for that journal.
