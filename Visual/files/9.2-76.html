   You may respond to this prompt with an exact device name which matches
a device in the DEVICE FILE; a device name preceeded by a minus sign; or
1, 2, or 3 question marks.
  
   '?' will show you this help screen again.
   '??' will show you the lists of devices you have already selected and
        deselected.
   '???' will show you the DEVICE FILE, which is the list of devices from
         which you may choose.
  
   Devices entered at this prompt become PERMITTED DEVICES for the options
you have already selected.  If the RESTRICT DEVICES field for a particular
option is set to YES then the kernel software will look through the list of
PERMITTED DEVICES to insure that the user can run that option from that
device.  If the device being used is not in the PERMITTED DEVICE list the
option will not work.  If the RESTRICT DEVICES field for an option is set 
to NO or is null then no check is made.
  
   When the program encounters a device name preceeded by a minus sign
it will first of all try to remove that device from the list you have
already entered.  If it cannot find it in that list it will assume that
it has been entered in a previous session and will attempt to remove it
from the PERMITTED DEVICE list already associated with the options
selected.
  
   Great care should be used if your system uses port contention as the
'device' may be somewhat arbitrary from the CPU end.  Device restriction
works best, of course, with hard-wired devices.
