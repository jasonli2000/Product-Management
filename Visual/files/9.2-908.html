MailMan gives you the opportunity to have your mail automatically
forwarded to a remote e-mail address. MailMan also gives you the option to
continue to receive e-mail at your local address as well.
 
The MailMan interface provides the Forwarding Address Edit option located
on the Personal Preferences menu to allow you to have your mail
automatically forwarded.
 
NOTE: This option may or may not be available to you. It depends on
      whether or not your site restricts access to this option to users
      holding the XMNET security key. For example, if your site requires
      users to hold the XMNET security key and you don't hold that key,
      you won't be able to use this option.
 
The Forwarding Address Edit option asks you to enter the following
information:
 
  * Forwarding Address - To what remote address should the mail be routed?
 
  * Local Delivery Flag - Should the mail be sent both remotely and
    locally or just remotely?
 
The FORWARDING ADDRESS field contains the name of the remote address to
which any MailMan messages addressed to you are routed. Only the original
message gets forwarded, replies to messages are not forwarded.
Messages sent by you to yourself are not forwarded.
 
NOTE: Broadcast messages will be forwarded like any other messages sent to
      your mailbox. However, since the Secretary's daily broadcast message
      on FORUM is sent to all sites, it will NOT be forwarded from FORUM.
 
The remote address must contain the remote name, an at-sign ('@' Shift-2
key on most keyboards), and the remote domain name (i.e., name@domain).
The entry can be up to 50 characters in length.
 
The value in the LOCAL DELIVERY FLAG field works in conjunction with the
FORWARDING ADDRESS field. If the FORWARDING ADDRESS field contains a
remote e-mail address, you should also set the LOCAL DELIVERY FLAG field.
 
MailMan gives you two possible entries for this field:
 
  * No Local Delivery (default) - If you have a FORWARDING ADDRESS and you
    do not want your messages delivered locally, set the LOCAL DELIVERY
    FLAG field to 'Off' (i.e., '0'). Your messages will only be delivered
    to your remote addresses.
 
  * Local Delivery On - If you have a FORWARDING ADDRESS and you want your
    messages delivered locally as well as remotely, set the LOCAL DELIVERY
    FLAG field to 'On' (i.e., '1'). Your messages will be delivered to
    both your local and remote addresses.
 
Also, if you've set the LOCAL DELIVERY FLAG field to continue to receive
mail locally, you may want to choose another MailMan user to act as your
[SURROGATE] so that they can read your local mail.
