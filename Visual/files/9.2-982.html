When addressing messages to mail groups, mail groups can be classified as
'large' (site-specified) and processed differently from 'small-' to
'medium-sized' mail groups. A mail group may be considered 'large' when it
has any of the following:
 
  * A large number of local and remote members.
 
  * At least one or more member groups.
 
  * At least one or more distribution lists.
 
The BIG GROUP SIZE (Field #7.2) in the MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS file (#4.3)
allows IRM to set the number used to indicate when a mail group is
considered 'large.' This helps eliminate the 'dots of death' when
addressing mail to a large group.
 
IRM can populate this field with a number ranging from 50 to 10,000 (no
decimal points). There is no default for this field. If BIG GROUP SIZE
equates to zero, then groups are processed in the foreground, as usual.
 
If IRM populates this field and if the group being addressed contains any
member groups, or distribution lists, or the number of local members plus
remote members exceeds or equals the BIG GROUP SIZE, then the user is
asked whether or not they want to queue the group for [LATER] delivery and
avoid waiting while the group is processed. The user is also warned that
if they choose to queue the delivery, then recipients cannot be 'minused'
from the group.
 
If the user chooses to queue the delivery to the group, they are asked
when the delivery should take place. The group will be queued for
processing and delivery at the specified date and time by the same
background job that 'news' messages.
 
If the user chooses not to queue the delivery to the group, then
processing proceeds in the foreground, as usual.
