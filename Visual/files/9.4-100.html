begins storing this data in the V POV file (#9000010.07). Therefore, after
sites install SD*5.3*132, the case finder (^YSASCF) will no longer find
outpatients because file #409.43 is no longer being updated.  Routine
YSASCF as released with patch YS*5.01*38 will be modified in this patch to
pull the information from the new file.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;46 SEQ #38</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1998-10-16 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 Some sites are getting errors while trying to install Mental Health patches
 when required mental health builds exist in the REQUIRED BUILDS field (#11) of
 the Kids BUILD file (#9.6).  The install will abort stating that a required
 patch is missing.  However, when the site checks on the missing patch, they
 discover that the patch IS installed.  This became evident when test sites
 were attempting to install YS*5.01*44 which required patch YS*5.01*38 to be
 installed.  The install would abort saying that patch 38 is not installed
 even though it was.  (This same error occurred when test sites were
 attempting to install YS*5.01*45.)
 
 This is caused by old entries in the PACKAGE (#9.4) file confusing the install.
 During installation of a Mental Health patch, the install looks at the
 PREFIX field (#1) of the PACAKAGE file (#9.4).  If it contains "YS", it
 then refers to the history for that package to verify that the required
 patches have been installed.  Any entries that contain the "YS" prefix but
 do not contain "Version 5.01 of Mental Health" in the SHORT DESCRIPTION
 field (#2), cause the install to look at the wrong history.  The install
 aborts because it does not find the required patches.
 
 This patch corrects the problem by executing routine YSPOS46 to "clean up"
 the PACKAGE file.  This routine is included as a post installation routine
 for this patch.  During the installation, the user is asked if they would
 like to 'Delete old package file entries?'  If the user says 'Yes', all but
 the current version 5.01 Mental Health entry is deleted.  If the user
 answers 'No', the old "YS" prefix entries in the "C" cross reference of the
 PACKAGE file (^DIC(9.4,"C","YS",0)) are renamed to YS1, YS2, YS3, etc.  Only
 the current version 5.01 entry is left unchanged.
 
 PLEASE NOTE THAT NOTHING IS INSTALLED WITH THIS PATCH.  IT CONSISTS ONLY OF
 THE USER QUESTION DURING INSTALLATION AND EXECUTION OF POST INSTALLATION
 ROUTINE YSPOS46.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 VHA Directive, 97-059, dated November 25, 1997, "Instituting Global
 Assessment of Function (GAF) Scores in Axis V Mental Health Patients", has
 been released.  This directive provides guidelines for collection of GAF
 Scores for outpatients and inpatients.  Inpatient Axis V (GAF) scores have
 been collected for several years, but up to now there has been no provision
 for collection of GAF Scores for outpatients.  Storage will be in the VISTA
 Mental Health software package.
 
 This patch contains two new API's that are used for the storage/retrieval
 of GAF score data in the DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS - MENTAL HEALTH file (#627.8).
 The API's are described as follows:
 
 API entry point RET^YSGAF(YSX) retrieves GAF score information from the
 DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS - MENTAL HEALTH file (#627.8).  It returns the latest GAF
 score and diagnosis date/time for the patient based on the internal entry
 number (variable YSX) passed into the API.  The score/date is returned in the
 form of a concatenated string.  If no GAF data is found, -1 is returned.
 
 API entry point UPD^YSGAF(YSPN,YSGN,YSGD,YSGC,YSPT) is designed to store
 patient GAF score information in the DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS - MENTAL HEALTH
 file (#627.8).  The following information is passed into this call:
 
        YSPN    Patient name -  Pointer to the PATIENT file (#2)
        YSGN    GAF score (Axis 5)
        YSGD    Date/Time of diagnosis
        YSGC    Diagnosis by -  Pointer to the NEW PERSON file (#200)
        YSPT    Patient type -  'I'npatient or 'O'utpatient
 
 This API updates new field PATIENT TYPE (#66) in the DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS -
 MENTAL HEALTH file (#627.8) which was created to store the patient type of
 the GAF record.  It is a set of codes consisting of 'I' for inpatient and 'O'
 for outpatient.
 
 This API routine call creates a new record with the above information in the
 DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS - MENTAL HEALTH file (#627.8) in order to maintain a
 historical record of GAF scores for an individual patient.

VHA Directive, 97-059, dated November 25, 1997, "Instituting Global 
Assessment of Function (GAF) Scores in Axis V Mental Health Patients", has 
been released.  This directive provides guidelines for collection of GAF 
Scores for outpatients and inpatients.  Inpatient Axis V (GAF) scores have 
been collected for several years, but up to now there has been no provision 
for collection of GAF Scores for outpatients.  Storage and collection of GAF
scores will be in the VISTA Mental Health software package file
DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS - MENTAL HEALTH (#627.8).  
 
The GAF initiative is using the VISTA HL7 software to transport the GAF 
score data onto the Austin Automation Center (AAC) system.  An A08 HL7 
message will be used to transmit GAF Scores to the National Patient
Care Database (NPCD). This message contains the MSH, EVN, PID and OBX
segments.
 
This patch will allow the sites to transmit GAF scores to the National 
Patient Care Database (NPCD) at the AAC.  Sites will be able to transmit GAF
scores in a batch mode using the call point EN^YSGAFTR.  EN^YSGAFTR will
prompt the user for a date range, this date range will be the selection
criteria that is used when determining the GAF scores to be transmitted to 
the NPCD at the AAC.  The batch processing will allow sites to initially 
populate GAF Scores at the NPCD.
 
After the running of the batch transmission of GAF scores, all GAF scores 
entered will be dynamically sent to the NPCD at the AAC.

The new Q-NPT.DOMAIN.EXT domain, which receives the HL7 messages,
implementation instructions are released by MailMan XM*DBA*119 informational
patch. 
 
The (G)lobal (A)ssessment of (F)unction Transmission patch components are:
        - 4 New routines, YS43POST, YSGAFHL7, YSGAFOBX, YSGAFTR
        - 2 Patched routines, YSDX3B, YSGAF
        - 2 New mail groups, YS GAF TO NPCD, YS GAF TRANSMISSION ACK
        - 2 New Protocols, YS GAF, YS GAF A08 CLIENT
        - 1 New HL7 Application Parameter, YS GAF
        - 1 New HL Lower Level Protocol Parameter, YS GAF SEND
        - 1 New HL Logical Link, YS GAF-SND
 
GAF Mail Groups
---------------
YS GAF TO NPCD: This mail group is used for transmission of HL7 messages 
derived from the parameters defined in the DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS - MENTAL 
HEALTH file (#627.8) to the AAC.
 
YS GAF TRANSMISSION ACK: This mail group is used to receive Confirmation 
and Processing Report Messages from Austin.  
 
Protocols
---------
YS GAF: This event driver protocol defines the associated parameters needed 
to build the HL7 message used to send the GAF data to Austin.
 
YS GAF A08 CLIENT: This subscriber protocol defines the parameter needed by 
HL7 package to determine where to send the HL7 formatted message 
containing the GAF information.
 
Changes to routine YSGAF (YS*5.01*42)
-------------------------------------
The API RET^YSGAF was changed to use the DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS - MENTAL
HEALTH file (#627.8) "C" cross-reference to look up the latest patient GAF
score. This corrected performance issues that were reported after the
loading of SD*5.3*149 and YS*5.01*42.

This patch updates the Clozapine reporting software as required by the
CLOZAPINE PATIENT MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL (CPMP).
 These changes include:
 1. Reporting Absolute Neutrophil Count (Calculated from percentage
    reported at the site).  
      The CLOZAPINE LAB TEST (#603.02) file has been created to facilitate
      this report.  The Neutrophil Count (#1) field in the CLOZAPINE LAB
      TEST (#603.02) file indicates the proper Neutrophil Count test to be
      used.
 2. Update Site Number reporting to comply with integrated site
    requirements.  
      References to the DEFAULT INSTITUTION (#217) field in the KERNEL
      SITE PARAMETERS (#4.3) are no longer supported.  These references
      were changed to the supported call $$SITE^VASITE referenced in
      DBIA#10112.
 3. Extend reporting time for White Blood Count to six months. Changes are
    also included to improve the reporting of the White Blood Count.
      The CLOZAPINE LAB TEST (#603.02) file has been created to facilitate
      this report.  The White Blood Count (#.01) field in the CLOZAPINE
      LAB TEST (#603.02) file indicates the proper White Blood Count test
      to be used.

This patch enhances the management report, Global Assessment of Functioning
(GAF).  The new option GAF Case Finder [YSGAF CASE FINDER] has been added as
an item to the MENU Global Assessment of Functioning [YSGAF MAIN].
 
The GAF report now lists all patients that have not been given a GAF score
within the last 90 days.  The user is given the option to sort the report
by patient name or by provider.  The results of this report are sent to the
MAILMAN system and are returned the user as a MAILMAN message.  It is also
recommended to queue the report during non-peak or after-hours.
 
The following is an example of the generated report:
 
               GAF Case Finder
Begining Date: DEC 1,1998
  Ending Date: MAR 18,1999
     Facility: Dallas CIOFO
 
The following is a list of all patients who had a Mental Health Outpatient
Encounter between the above dates but do not have a GAF score WITHIN 90
DAYS.  Last MH (non-telephonic) Outpatient Encounter in date range is listed.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Seven new Psychological Testing APIs/RPCs have been developed to allow reading 
and saving of psychological testing data. This data normally resides in the 
PSYCH INSTRUMENT PATIENT file (#601.2) for patient responses and the
MH INSTRUMENT file (#601) for test and interviews.  In addition, the
APIs/RPCs retrieve ADDICTION SEVERITY INDEX data found in the ADDICTION
SEVERITY INDEX file (#604) and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) data
found in the DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS - MENTAL HEALTH file (#627.8).

This patch contains:
       one new file MH MULTIPLE SCORING (#601.6).  This file allows the
       user to score multiple instruments.

       eleven new routines YSGAFAPI, YSMTI, YSMTI0, YSMTI1, YSMTI3
       YSMTI4, YSMTI5, YTAPI, YTAPI1, YTAPI2 and YTAPI3.

       one new option Multiple Psych Testing [YT MTI] displays history of
       psychological testing for an individual patient.

   Installation Instructions:
   ==========================
  
   1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.
      This option will load the KIDS package in this message onto your
      system.

   2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
      On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
      following options:
  
                 Print Transport Global
                 Compare Transport Global to Current System
                 Verify Checksums in Transport Global
                 Backup a Transport Global
  
   3. Users may remain on the system, but installation should be done at
      off peak hours.
  
   4. Installation will take less than five minutes. 
  
   5. From the 'Installation Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the option 
      'Install Package(s)' Select the package 'YS*5.01*53' and proceed
      with install.

   6. If you do not intend to queue the installation to run after normal
      business hours, then answer "NO" to the following prompt:
    
      Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES// NO
    
      If you answer "YES", then the installation will require much more 
      than 5 minutes to run due to the menu rebuild process.

   7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
      and Protocols? YES//', respond  NO.

This patch corrects an error that occurs in menu option "Identify Potential
Merge Problems [XDR VALID CHECK]".  Although it originally appeared to be a
FILEMAN error, it was later determined to be a data dictionary problem with
the MEDICAL RECORDS file (#90) of the MENTAL HEALTH Version 5.01 software
application.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The following items are addressed in patch YS*5.01*54:

 1. Patch YS*5.01*54 releases two new psychological tests/interviews to 
    the Mental Health package.  These tests are accessed via menu item 
    Psychological tests/interviews (administer) [YSADMTEST].  The new 
    tests are as follows:
  
    a. Test Name:  AIMS
       Description:  Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale  
       Number of Questions:  12
       Number of Scales:  1
  
    b. Test Name:  AUDC
       Description:  Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Condensed
       Number of Questions:  3
       Number of Scales:  1
   
    These tests are stored as new entries in the MH INSTRUMENT FILE (#601).
  
 2. Two new routines are included in patch YS*5.01*54.  They are:
    YTAIMS      -  Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale
    YTALUSEC    -  Test-Audit Alcohol Screen Condensed

 3.  When the user selects option Psychological tests/interviews
    (administer) [YSADMTEST] and chooses the instrument "MMPI" a message
    is displayed on the screen "You have selected the "MMPI" instrument, 
    the "MMPI2" instrument will be administered in its place.". Routines
    YTAR and YTS have been modified to display this message.

 4. The file MH INSTRUMENT (#601) field OPERATIONAL (#32) will be populated
    with a value of "N" for the instrument MMPI when the post routine YS54POST
    is executed.

 5. Patch YS*5.01*54 also includes updates to the instruments AUDIT, 
    CAGE, DOM80, DOM81, DOM82, DOMG, and the SMAST.  These instruments were 
    sent out in patch YS*5.01*31 as NON-EXEMPT, when they should have been 
    sent out as EXEMPT.  The file MH INSTRUMENT (#601) field EXEMPT TEST (#21)
    for the instruments mentioned will be populated with a value of "Y"
    when the post routine YS54POST is executed.

 6. Patch YS*5.01*54 also includes 2 additional entries in the MH INSTRUMENT 
    FILE (#601).  The Addiction Survey Index (ASI) and the Global 
    Assessment of Functioning (GAF) are placeholders to be used in retrieving
    ASI and GAF data used by APIs and RPCs released in patch YS*5.01*53.
    These entries are non operational when accessed via menu item 
    Psychological tests/interviews (administer) [YSADMTEST].

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;55 SEQ #53</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2000-04-05 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses the following problems associated with the Mental 
Health ADDICTION SURVEY INDEX software.
 
1.  Problem: $ZE= &lt;UNDEFINED&gt;PUTWP+9^DIEFW.
    The option ASI National Roll Up [YSAS NATIONAL ROLL UP] gets the
    undefined error because of the change to the temporary data gathering 
    global structure after the installation of Mailman Patch 50 &amp; FILEMAN 
    V. 22.  The code in routine ^YSASRU has been corrected.
 
2.  Problem: $ZE= PTFLP+4^YSASCF:1, %DSM-E-UNDEF, undefined variable.
    The option ASI Case finder [YSAS CASE FINDER] will error out at
    PTFLP+4^YSASCF when it encounters A missing node in the PTF file (#45) 
    multiple field 501 (#50).  The code in routine YSASCF has been 
    corrected.
 
3.  Problem: $ZE= OE+3^YSASCF:1, %DSM-E-UNDEF, undefined variable
    The option ASI Case Finder [YSAS CASE FINDER] will error out at 
    OE+3^YSASCF when the "B" cross reference was created for The Outpatient 
    Encounter file (#409.68) but did not contain the zero node for that 
    entry.  The routine YSASCF has been modified to check if the entry
    exists.
 
4.  The option ASI Follow-up Finder [YSAS FOLLOWUP FINDER] generates a
    mail message that splits the results into separate mail messages for
    every 1000 lines.  The subject of each mail message displays which
    page of how many pages there are for the report generated.
    Such as below:
 
    ASI Follow-up Reminder      (1 OF 2),(2 of 2) etc. 
 
    The page counter in the subject of the mail message created in routine  
    YSASFUR has been corrected.

5.  The routine YSASCF has been corrected to retrieve the correct 
    institution station number.  This error would only occur at Anchorage,
    Honolulu, Las Vegas, San Juan and West Palm Beach.

6.  The option Activate/Inactivate ASI Program Types [YSAS ASI PROGRAM
    ACTIVATION] allows the user to edit the TITLE field (#1) instead of
    the ACTIVE field (#3) in the ASI PROGRAM TYPE file (#604.26).  This
    has been corrected in routine YSASFM.

7.  When the narrative report prints, the employee who administers
    (interviewer) the Addiction Severity Index has a title that contains
    Roman Numerals.  When converting the text from upper case to lower
    case the second Roman numeral in the interviewers title is printed
    in lower case.  This has been corrected in routine YSASNAR.

            space.
 
         8. From the 'Installation Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the option 
            'Install Package(s)' Select the package 'YS*5.01*61' and
            proceed with the install.
 
         9. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should
            be returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
            completion.
 
        10. The routine YSCLPRE will be automatically deleted after the
            installation has run to completion.

<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2000-06-26 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Two new Psychological Testing APIs/RPCs have been developed to allow reading
and saving of psychological testing data. This data normally resides in the 
PSYCH INSTRUMENT PATIENT file (#601.2) for patient responses and the
MH INSTRUMENT file (#601) for test and interviews.  In addition, the
APIs/RPCs retrieve ADDICTION SEVERITY INDEX data found in the ADDICTION
SEVERITY INDEX file (#604) and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) data
found in the DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS - MENTAL HEALTH file (#627.8).

This patch contains:
     Four new fields have been added to file MH MULTIPLE SCORING (#601.6).
     The new fields are OUTCOMES (#5) and RESULTS (#6) a multiple containing
     sub-fields RESULTS NUMBER (#.01), RESULTS DESCRIPTION (#1) and RESULTS
     TEXT (#2).
     Four new routines YSMTI2, YSMTI6, YTAPI4 and YTAPI5.
     One modified routine YTAPI2.
     Two new APIs and Remote Procedures YTAPI PREVIEW and YTAPI OUTNOTE.

Documentation for APIs and RPCs
-------------------------------
1.  PREVIEW
       RPC: YTAPI PREVIEW
       M:   PREVIEW^YTAPI4
This API allows scoring of patient responses to a test or interview without 
making changes in the M database. The patient ien, the test code, and 
administration date is required along with the responses. All responses are 
checked for validity. Scoring is returned in the output documented in the 
SCOREIT API.

Input: 
------
DFN: patient internal identifier

                 (score =|SCORE|).
        10-16    The Beck Depression Inventory suggests mild mood disorder
                 (score =|SCORE|).
        17-29    The Beck Depression Inventory suggests moderate mood disorder
                 (score =|SCORE|).
          &gt;29    The Beck Depression Inventory suggests severe mood disorder
                 (score =|SCORE|).
CAGE      &lt;2     An alcohol screening test (CAGE) was negative 
                 (score =|SCORE|).
          &gt;1     An alcohol screening test (CAGE) was positive

DOM80            A mood disorder screening test (DOM80) was negative.
                 A mood disorder screening test (DOM80) was positive.
                 1. The DOM80 does not have a cut-off score.  Rather, the
                    algorithm is:
                   a. If Q1 returned = Y, then the test is positive.
                   b. If Q2 returned = Y and Q3 = Y and Q4 &gt; 1, then the test
                      is positive.
                   c. If neither a nor b (above) is true, then the test is
                      negative.
DOMG      &lt;4     A mood disorder screening test (DOMG) was negative
                 (score =|SCORE|).
          &gt;3     A mood disorder screening test (DOMG) was positive

          &gt;106   This patient endorsed fewer items associated with PTSD
                 than is commonly found in Vietnam veterans diagnosed with
                 PTSD (MISS score =|SCORE|).
SMAST     &gt;2     Positive  screen for alcoholism.
  6 or 10 or 11  Previous treatment for alcoholism reported.
          &lt;3     Negative  screen for alcoholism.

                 (score =|SCORE|).
          &gt;50    A mood disorder screening test (ZUNG) was in the high range
                 (score =|SCORE|).

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;59 SEQ #58</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2000-08-16 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses the following issues in the Mental Health GAF software. 

1. The description of Mail Group 'YS GAF TRANSMISSION ACK' has been edited.
   This mail group will receive a message with the subject of 'GAF Score
   Sent' when a GAF score is transmitted to the National Patient Care
   Database (NPCD) at the Austin Automation Center (AAC) in Austin, Texas.
   If an error in the transmission has occurred the subject of the message
   will be 'GAF Score Transmission Problem'.  This mail group will also be
   used to receive a transmission report, GAF Facility Report, with the
   subject 'NPT/XXX #XXXXXXXXXXXX' from the NPCD at the AAC.  The 'XXXs'
   in the subject are random alphanumerics produced by the AAC system.  The
   report will contain the number of messages received, number of messages
   processed and number of messages processed in error.  The report will
   also contain a detail line for each type of error.  The detail error line
   of the report will contain the reject message ID number, Error Code,
   Event Date-Time, Social Security Number, Last Name of Patient, Date
   of Birth and the Inpatient/Outpatient Status.  A document, YS_501_59.PDF,
   describing the error codes provided by NPCD is available on one of the
   following OI Field Offices' ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directories in Albany,
   Hines or Salt Lake City.

2. The routine YSGAFOBX was setting the Mail Group to use 'YS GAF TO NPCD',
   therefore sending a MAILMAN message containing text to be processed by 
   NPCD at the AAC.  These messages should have been sent locally to the
   members of Mail Group 'YS GAF TRANSMISSION ACK' who are responsible for
   the Global Assessment of Function monitoring.  The subjects of these
   messages are 'GAF Score Sent' and 'GAF Score Transmission Problem'.
   The message 'GAF Score Sent' contains the patients name, date of
   observation the GAF score was assessed and the HL7 message number
   transmitted to NPCD at the AAC.  The message 'GAF Score Transmission
   Problem' contains the reason why the message was not transmitted, user
   who entered the GAF score, patient name, observation date and file entry
   date.

3. A new option 'GAF Transmission' [YS GAF TRANSMISSION] will be used to
   retransmit GAF data for a given date range to the National Patient Care
   Database at the Austin Automated Center in Austin, TX.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The following items are addressed in patch YS*5.01*66:

1. When selecting the option 'Psychological tests/interviews (administer)'
   [YSADMTEST] to administer the instrument 'Abnormal Involuntary Movement 
   Scale' (AIMS) the user is instructed to enter the key letter "E" to view
   examination procedures and then to enter any key in order to progress.
   At the end of the instructions, any key will not work.  The user has to
   use the ENTER key to exit the instructions.  This has been corrected to
   accept any key entered as instructed.  
   DAY-0200-42682

2. The test (STAI), 'STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY SCALE', a general test of anxiety 
   as a mood (state) and as a personality characteristic (trait) was scored
   directly.  The Scale #2 Trait Anxiety (Item #34) has been changed to score
   indirectly.

3. The test 'Personality Assessment Inventory' (PAI) scoring routine YTPAI
   has been edited to correct an indexing problem at ADDIT+5^YTPAI.

4. The RESPONSE PROMPT field (#4), of the multiple ITEM NUMBER field (#1),
   of the MH INSTRUMENT file (#601) for the entry 'Personality Assessment
   Inventory' (PAI) has been changed to a semicolon following the word 
   "false" so parsing of the response can be done.

5. The RESPONSE PROMPT field (#4), of the multiple ITEM NUMBER field (#1),
   of the MH INSTRUMENT file (#601) for the entry 'Beck Anxiety Index' (BAI)
   has been changed to a semicolon following the word "unpleasant" so 
   parsing of the response can be done.

6. The test 'Depression Outcomes Module' (DOM) scoring routine YSMTI1 was
   modified to allow multiple test scoring.

7. The following fields were found setting %DT(0) to some value, with no
   corresponding Kill of %DT(0) in the Input Transform.  Leaving %DT(0) 
   defined can have an adverse impact on the end user.  This patch places
   the KILL of %DT(0) after the call of ^%DT in the Input transform.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. The YSCL WEEKLY TRANSMISSION [Weekly Clozapine Report] option should
now be queued to run daily instead of weekly (see item 11 in the
installation instructions below).  A new file CLOZAPINE PARAMETERS
(#603.03) has been created to maintain site configuration and transmission
data to be reported back to the National Clozapine Coordinating Center
NCCC in Dallas.  This file also contains an entry indicating the day of
the week the roll-up should occur.
 
2. The YSCL TRANSMIT DEMOGRAPHICS [Transmit Clozapine Demographics] option
is no longer necessary and its associated task should be deleted (see item
10 in the installation instructions below).  The demographics data will
now be collected during the regular roll-up.  No error will occur and no
harm will be done if this task remains active.
 
3. The CLOZAPINE LAB TEST file (#603.02) is no longer used for the
roll-up. The roll-up software will now use the CLOZAPINE LAB TEST field
(#17.7) in the DRUG file (#50) to determine the WBC and ANC tests used for
each drug.  Using this method will ensure a common element between the
dispensing and tracking of the prescription.
 
4. The Weekly Clozapine Report [YSCL WEEKLY TRANSMISSION] option has been
modified to respond to the Kernel Stop Task Manager [XUTM STOP] option.
This provides a graceful way to terminate processing of the roll-up.

                  ALN-0400-11672     CLOZAPINE MONITOR MESSAGE INCORRECT
                       The message generated for the transmission of
                       patient data to the national database incorrectly
                       reported that some patients' had no prescription
                       data. This was due to the method used to collect
                       and compare the date of the prescription to the
                       current date.

                       Some sites were concerned because the Clozapine
                       roll-up software requires that the patient's race
                       be entered into the database.  This is clinically
                       relevant data and is required by both the
                       manufacturer and the Food and Drug Administration
                       (FDA).  Race may be entered as long as permission
                       to report this data is obtained on the consent to
                       release document.  See VHA Directive 99-035.

         Installation Instructions:
         ==========================
 
  NOTE: This KIDS install does not place any options out of service
        during the install and no user options are affected.
 
        The site should answer "NO" to all three questions.
            Note: You may not receive all three prompts at your site.
 
        "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
         Install? YES// NO"
 
        "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// NO"
 
        "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols?
         YES// NO"
 
         1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.
            This option will load the KIDS package in this message onto
            your system.
 
         2. Review your mapped set.  If the routines are mapped, they
            should be removed from the mapped set at this time.
 
         3. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
            system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport
            global.
 
            On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
            following options:
                Print Transport Global
                Compare Transport Global to Current System
                Verify Checksums in Transport Global
                Backup a Transport Global
 
         4. Users may remain on the system, installation may be done at
            any time except during the time scheduled for the Clozapine
            roll-up.
 
         5. No options need to be placed out of service.
 
         6. Installation time is less than 2 minutes during off peak hours
            and less than 5 minutes during peak hours.
 
         7. Installation of this patch requires no additional memory
            space.
 
         8. From the 'Installation Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the option
            'Install Package(s)' Select the package 'YS*5.01*69 and
            proceed with the install.
 
         9. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should
            be returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
            completion.
 
        10. Historically, the option YSCL TRANSMIT DEMOGRAPHICS
            [Transmit Clozapine Demographics] had been queued to run
            before the start of business every Tuesday.  This function
            has been incorporated into the Clozapine Data Collection
            and this option is no longer used.  This task should be
            deleted.  This is accomplished using the XUTM SCHEDULE
            [Schedule/Unschedule Options] option.  The following screen
            capture will closely resemble the display from your system.
            To delete the task, enter the @ sign in the Option Name field
            and press the Enter key.  You will then be asked if you want

This patch addresses the following issue in the Mental Health software. 

 1. In the MH INSTRUMENT file (#601) field OPERATIONAL (#32), data value
    has been changed from null to "N" in the following instruments CES,
    FES, GES, WES, CPI, FIRO, SII, MYER, MCMI, MMPR and the M168.  This
    field when SET to "N" indicates that the instrument is NOT operational.
    This allows the instrument to remain in the data base but can NOT be
    USED.

Patch YS*5.01*67 COTS ASI-MV introduces the required components necessary to
install and run the Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) Addiction Severity Index
Multimedia Version (ASI-MV) software product.

The Mental Health ASI-MV, Vista version, is a software product that is the
result of the combination of a commercial (COTS) multimedia application
(ASIMV) and a VA-developed interface to the VistA database (YSASIMV). The
ASI-MV is a patient self-administered psychological instrument that can be
used to gather patient data directly from the patient. Both the clinician
and the patient interact with the ASI-MV. The clinician logs on to VistA,
initializes program parameters, and enters patient demographic info. The
patient then responds to questions presented by the multimedia interface.
The clinician needs not be present during the time when the patient is
responding to questions. After the patient completes the interview, the
clinician starts the interface (YSASIMV) again, to upload the interview
data to VistA.

SecureDesktop is a software module that restricts user (patient) access to 
the Windows desktop, to task-switching functions, and to other programs on
the workstation, while the patient responds to the interview. This module 
implements the bulk of security countermeasures for the ASI-MV system.

The patch contains the following additions and modifications to the VistA
Mental Health software:

Data in the ASI QUICK FORM file (#604.66), REQUIRED field (#11) has been
changed from '1' to a Null value making the following questions to be 
non-required for scoring the ASI: M10, M11, E23, E24, L31, L32, F37, F38,
P21 and P22.  This process will be performed by the post routine YS67.

The ADDICTION SEVERITY INDEX file (#604) fields CLASS (#.04) and CONTACT CODE 
(#.07) have a new selection code, "For ASI-MV".

The ADDICTION SEVERITY INDEX file (#604) fields ELECTRONICALLY SIGNED 
(#.51) and E SIGNATURE INTERVIEWER (#.52) data attributes have been changed
to allow these fields data to be edited.

Two new entries have been added to the ASI NARRATIVE file (#604.68).  
The two new narrative reports are the ASI-MV ITEM REPORT and the ASI-MV
NARRATIVE.

The routine YSASNAR has been modified to produce the ASI-MV ITEM REPORT and 
the ASI-MV NARRATIVE.

The new option YS BROKER [YS BROKER] contains the context necessary
to interface the ASI-MV to VistA.

A Remote Procedure YTAPI NEW ASI has been created.

The new routine YTAPI8 allows silent additions to the ADDICTION SEVERITY INDEX 
file (#604).

Patch YS*5.01*71 introduces the Mental Health Assistant Graphical User
Interface to VISTA.
 
The Mental Health Assistant (MHA) is a graphical user interface for the
most frequently used options within the VistA Mental Health Package,
viz., psychological testing, the Addiction Severity Index (ASI), and
the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF).
 
All previous tests completed by the selected patient are listed on the
Test Results tab.  A text report is shown for the selected test, and
graphs of numeric scores are available across all instances of a given
test.
 
The Order Tests tab enables the user to specify the staff person
ordering the test and to select from among the tests available to the
person who ordered the test.  Three data entry modes are available:
(1)  Staff entry is optimized for the entry of staff rating data (e.g.,
     the AIMS), which requires the user to see the test questions and
     answers.
(2)  Clerk entry is optimized for transcribing test data from paper
     answer sheets.
(3)  Patient entry is optimized for on-line testing of patients.  The
     patient entry option contains security features to prevent
     unattended patients from using the PC in unauthorized ways.
 
The ASI tab lists all previous ASI interviews and makes it easy to view
either the item report or narrative report for a selected interview.
To help with ASI performance measure compliance, the interval since the
last interview is displayed.  New views of ASI data are the "Domain
Scores" and "Item Trends" buttons, which present graphical and tabular
data across multiple interviews.  The Domain Scores button gives the
user the opportunity to see either problem severity ratings or
evaluation factor scores.  The Item Trends button displays responses to
selected individual items.  It is hoped that these data views will help
with treatment planning and treatment outcome monitoring.  A user-
friendly interface for entering interview data is provided.  This tab
enables staff to quickly enter data, to easily jump from one item to
another, and to enter free text comments at any time.  This tab should
greatly reduce data entry time, whether transcribing interview results
from a paper form or entering them on-line during an interview.
 
The GAF tab affords the user an easy way to enter GAF ratings and to
see previous ratings, which are graphed to indicate trends.  When
entering a new rating, the rating is associated with the GAF rating
criteria.  It is hoped this association will increase the reliability
of ratings and reduce inter-rater variability in the assignment of GAF
ratings.
 
The patch contains one option, a data change to the PAI entry in the MH
MULTIPLE SCORING (#601.6) file, a data change to the MMPI2, AUDC and
the DOMG entries in the MH INSTRUMENT (#601) file, 16 routines and 28
Remote Procedures.
 
The new non-menu option YS BROKER1 [YS BROKER1] contains the context
necessary to interface the MHA GUI to VistA.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 The Clozapine reporting software will automatically discontinue a 
patient if the patient's prescription is over 28 days old.  This prevents 
a patient from being issued medication on an expired prescription.  The 
Clozapine protocol requires a new prescription each time the medication 
is dispensed.  Clozapine patients are being discontinued whose 
prescriptions are current.  This happens when the roll-up occurs between 
the time when the prescription is entered into the system and when it is 
dispensed.  This patch will prevent the patient from being discontinued 
until the prescription is 28 days past the fill date.
 
 Clozapine data is transmitted to the field offices in Hines and Dallas.  
The domain names have been changed from ISC-DALLAS.DOMAIN.EXT and 
ISC-CHICAGO.DOMAIN.EXT to FO-DALLAS.DOMAIN.EXT and FO-HINES.DOMAIN.EXT.
 
THIS PATCH WILL REPORT THE NEW RACE AND ETHNICITY ENTRIES TO THE NATIONAL 
CLOZAPINE DATABASE.

THIS PATCH WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE TIME OF INITIAL RELEASE.

Reference NOIS:   COA-0901-21209     CLOZAPINE PATIENTS INACTIVATED
                       I've been informed by Pharmacy service that we
                       continue to have Clozapine patients being
                       automatically inactivated (details can be
                       provided). We have previously worked with
                       Stephanie Todd from Dallas on specific problems,
                       however, NOIS BAC-0701-40194 notes in response
                       #22 that a patch is forthcoming.
 
                  BAC-0701-40194     Random inactivation of clozapine
                                     pts
                       Our pharmacy ADPAC has been reporting for awhile
                       about Clozapine patients being inactivated.
                       I initially held off reporting this via NOIS
                       because I knew that PSO*7*56 was going to
                       address these problem previously reported by
                       other sites. We installed it in March, but it's
                       happened again randomly.  This time I had the
                       adpac report the patients name to me so that I
                       can begin to look at it.
 
                  BHS-0302-12595     Cloz trans failed
                  MAD-0402-41028     Clozapine transmission failed
                       Both NOIS calls report an undefined error during
                       data transmission.  The reporting mechanism has
                       been modified to prevent this error.
                  UNY-0402-11524     CLOZARIL PATIENTS STILL BEING
                                     INACTIVATED
                       I still have complaints of patients being
                       inactivated for some reason and the pharmacy
                       needs to activate each time before entering
                       clozaril scripts.  The local site has contacted
                       the NCCC and they just tell them to re-activate
                       and there is nothing wrong on their end.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses the following issues in the Mental Health software. 
 
 1. Patients who take the BECK SCALE FOR SUICIDAL IDEATION (BSI) test on
    the Mental Health Assistant are presented with questions that do not 
    make sense when compared to their previous answers. For example, the 
    patient says that he/she is not suicidal but the test asks him/her 
    detailed questions about the last attempt and possible future attempts
    at suicide.  The skip logic for the BSI was not included in MHA.
    The skip logic for the BSI using the List Manager software worked
    properly. This has been corrected in MHA 1.0.2.10.
    CLE-0303-41699
 
 2. New scales have been added to the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality 
    Inventory-2 (MMPI2).  The new scales are the Restructured Clinical
    (RC) Scales for the MMPI2.  The RC scales are based on recent factor
    analyses of the existing Clinical Scales, and are intended to be used
    as aids in the interpretation of the Clinical Scale profile.  The names
    of the 9 RC scales are as follows (note that there is no RC5 scale):
    RCd: Demoralization
    RC1: Somatic Complaints
    RC2: Low Positive Emotions
    RC3: Cynicism
    RC4: Antisocial Behavior
    RC6: Ideas of Persecution
    RC7: Dysfunctional Negative Emotions
    RC8: Aberrant Experiences
    RC9: Hypomanic Activation
 
    Note:
    The set of MMPI2 scales that are scored and the order in which they are 
    presented has been changed to be consistent with the recommendations of 
    the test authors and publisher. 
 
    The PTSD-Schlenger scale is no longer scored.
 
 
 3. Three new psychological tests have been added to the MH INSTRUMENT 
    (#601) file.  The new depression measures include the 20-item version
    Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD), the Center 
    For Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale 5 Items (CESD5) and the 
    Prime-MD Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9).  The PHQ9 is based on 
    the 9 DSM-IV criteria for Major Depressive Episode, and test results
    include both the number of criteria met as well as indication of 
    whether the criteria for MDE are met.  All can now be administered 
    using the Mental Health Assistant.
 
 4. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Condensed (AUDC) has been
    revised to meet the new Alcohol Screening Performance Measure issued by
    the Office of Quality and Performance.
 
 5. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Condensed Revised (AUDCR)
    has been made non-operational by setting the value to "N" in the 
    MH INSTRUMENT file (#601) OPERATIONAL field (#32).
 
 6. An entry to the COPYRIGHT HOLDER file (#601.3) has been made for the new
    psychological test PHQ9.
 
 7. The instrument Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEOPI) in the MH
    MULTIPLE SCORING file (#601.6), which allows the user to score
    multiple instruments, has been edited to correctly return scale 
    scores to be displayed on the Test Results in the Mental Health
    Assistant (MHA).
 
    Also corrected within the NEOPI is item #86 which read "When I'm under 
    a great deal of stress, sometimes I fell like I'm going to pieces.".  
    Item #86 now reads as "When I'm under a great deal of stress, sometimes
    I feel like I'm going to pieces." 
 
 
 8. When running option List Test and Interviews [YSMLST] from programmer
    prompt...%DSM-E-ENDOFILE, end of file encountered.  This error has been 
    corrected.
    EKH-0698-41771
 

 9. The instrument Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III (MCMI3) in the 
    MH INSTRUMENT file (#601) ITEM NUMBER field (#1) entry #41 which read
    "I've done a number of stupid things on impulse that needed up causing 
    me great trouble.". Item Number #41 now reads as "I've done a number of
    stupid things on impulse that ended up causing me great trouble."
    CTX-1003-71717

    Also within the MCMI3 the TEST SCALE NUMBER field (#16) SCALE NAME
    sub-field (#.05) for entries 12, 14 and 15 which read:

          6B Aggressive/Sadistic
          8A Passive-Aggressive
          8B Self-Defeating

    SCALE NAME entries 12, 14 and 15 now read as:

          6B Sadistic
          8A Negativistic
          8B Masochistic

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch replaces the Mental Health option Usage Statistics [YSMUSE] with 
a new Mental Health option Mental Health Test Usage Server [YS TEST USAGE].
This is a server option to be used only by the members of the National Mental 
Health Strategic Healthcare Group (MHSHG) to determine the annual 
psychological test instrument usage at a site.

This patch contains one new server option Mental Health Test Usage Server [YS 
TEST USAGE] and one new routine YSTUSE.  Option Usage Statistics [YSMUSE] 
and routine YTSTAT are deleted during installation of the patch.

The server option Mental Health Test Usage Server [YS TEST USAGE] is 
activated by a mail message.  The mail message invokes the routine YSTUSE 
which returns the results of the psychological test instrument usage at the 
site the mail message is sent to.  

This is an example to invoke the server to create the mail message.

Patch YS*5.01*84 addresses three issues within the Mental Health software.

1. In the MH INSTRUMENT file (#601), ITEM NUMBER field (#1), TEXT sub-field 
(#2) for the entry the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI2) a period has 
been added to the end of each response number.  This will allow a reminder
to be built by the Clinical Reminder software.  Here is an example of the
edit made to ITEM NUMBER 2 of the BDI2 instrument using a FILEMAN inquiry:

Before patch:

ITEM NUMBER: 2                          VALID RESPONSE SET: 0123X
 TEXT: PESSIMISM
  
 0 I am not discouraged about my future.
 1 I feel more discouraged about my future than I used to be.
 2 I do not expect things to work out for me.
 3 I feel my future is hopeless and will only get worse.

After patch:

ITEM NUMBER: 2                          VALID RESPONSE SET: 0123X
 TEXT: PESSIMISM
  
 0. I am not discouraged about my future.
 1. I feel more discouraged about my future than I used to be.
 2. I do not expect things to work out for me.
 3. I feel my future is hopeless and will only get worse.


2. In the Mental Health Assistant GUI version 1.0.2.9 when using the mouse 
scroll button in the left-hand pane, the pane freezes at times.  Returning 
to the desktop the mouse arrow suddenly becomes unresponsive to mouse 
movements and begins performing the movements that should have occurred in 
the Mental Health Assistant - in the same area of the screen where the lists 
of tests was.  This has been corrected in MHA 1.0.2.10 to properly navigate 
the large amounts of patient psychological test data users may have.

3. The instrument ANALYSIS OF RELATIONSHIPS (AOR) has been made
non-operational by setting the value to "N" in the MH INSTRUMENT file
(#601) OPERATIONAL field (#32).

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Recent changes in the Clozapine protocol require changes to the Clozapine 
Roll Up software.  Originally, all Clozapine prescriptions were limited 
to 7 days.  Renewals and refills were not allowed.  In addition, the 
Clozapine reporting software automatically discontinued any patient if 
the patient's prescription was over 28 days old.  This was to prevent a 
patient from being issued medication on an expired prescription.  The 
revised Clozapine protocol allows for a monthly prescription as well as 
weekly and bi-weekly.  The patient is now automatically discontinued if 
the issue date for the most recent prescription is greater than 56 days 
in the past.
 
The weekly roll-up creates a report that is sent to the local G.PSOCLOZ 
mail group.  This report lists the patients reported to the national 
database along with an indicator showing whether or not Lab and RX data 
were transmitted.  This report has been updated to show the date of the 
most recent WBC (White Blood Count) and Neutrophil Count along with the 
date of the most recent Clozapine prescription.  Mental Health and 
Pharmacy personnel responsible for prescribing and dispensing Clozapine 
should be made aware of this mail group and given the opportunity to join.
 
NEW OPTION:
==========
The Link Multiple Tests to Clozapine [CLOZAPINE MULTI TEST LINK] option 
must be assigned to the person or persons responsible for ensuring that 
the appropriate data is in place to validate Clozapine testing data.  
This is usually the Laboratory ADPAC.
 
This option will ask for the local laboratory name that equates to the 
following seven common test names
 
White Blood Cell Count
Absolute Neutrophil Count
Neutrophil %
Segs  (Percent)
Bands (Percent)
Segs  (Absolute Count)
Bands (Absolute Count)
 
You will also be asked to fill in the reporting format for each test.  
Most sites report WBC and Neutrophil results in K/unit format (K/cc or 
K/cu mm or K/mm-3 or K/mL). For example, WBC equals 5.1.  However, some 
report results as discrete units. For example, WBC equals 5100.  This 
field will allow the site to specify how results are reported.  Entries 
that report in a percentage (such as Neutrophil %, Segs %, and Bands %) 
should use "Percentage".
 
You may input as many names from the local laboratory definition for each 
of these tests as needed.  Remember that the laboratory may have designed 
special names for specific test equipment, specific test locations, or 
specific test conditions, such as manual counts.  
 
In fact, if your facility has Clozapine patients with blood samples drawn 
and tested on a fee-basis at other CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
Amendments) approved labs, it is extremely important for your Laboratory 
have tests to accept manual input of these tests.  
 
Therefore, you should involve laboratory managers or ADPAC (Automated 
Data Processing Application Coordinator) in selection of these names - 
both to define the test names currently in use and to create the 
provision for manual entry of data.  Please be certain every possible 
local laboratory name that represents these tests is entered that relates 
to each of the seven test names above.  Pharmacy dispense will be 
prevented unless the program can find the needed test results under one 
of names you identify as an equivalent for each of the seven tests.
 
Security Key: The YSCL AUTHORIZED Security Key is new with this patch.  
 This key must be assigned to each provider authorized to dispense 
 Clozapine.

The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) uses White Blood Cell Count and 
Absolute Neutrophil Count as the definitive tests to verify for Clozapine 
use, however your lab may report your data under any of the names you 
enter into these lists.  If the WBC and ANC are not directly available, 
ANC will be calculated from the other data available and presented to 
Pharmacy (and CPRS (Computerized Patient Record System) during a later 
revision) at the time of dispense and used to evaluate the safety under 
FDA limits.  Only the most recent WBC will be accepted, and the date and 
time stamp of the Neutrophil count must match the date and time stamp of 
the WBC.
 
 
WHITE BLOOD CELL  (WBC)
 
For reference  "White Blood Cell Count" is a portion of the total blood 
content and the sum total of two different kinds of cells - 
 
         AGRANULOCYTES - those cells which do not have granules
         that absorb a stain.  These cells are subdivided
         into Lymphocytes and Monocytes. 
 
         GRANULOCYTES  -- those cells which contain granules
         that absorb a stain.  These cells are subdivided
         into Neutrophils, Basophils, and Eosinophils.  
 
Both Agranulocytes and Granulocytes are part of the Total White Blood 
Cell Count.  Therefore, the total WBC is the sum of five different types 
of cells.  
 
WBC as well as its five components are usually expressed as the total 
number of cells in a cubic centimeter of blood (cc) or cubic millimeter 
(cu mm or mm-3)or milliliters (mL).  
 
WBC usually falls with a range between 4000 and 11,000 but fluctuates for 
a number of medical reasons.  For brevity, WBC results may be divided by 
1000 and presented as K/cc or K/cu mm or K/mm-3 or K/mL
 
 
The five components are similarly expressed as number of the same type OR 
as a percentage of the total WBC.  
 
The sum of counts of the five components of should equal the total WBC OR 
the sum of the percentages of the five components should equal 100%
 
This test is sometimes also referred to as "Leukocyte Count" 
 
 
Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC)
 
The Absolute Neutrophil Count is the total number of Neutrophil cells in 
the total WBC count.  The other GRANULOCYTE cells - Basophils and 
Eosinophils (see White Blood Cell Count above) - are not included in this 
number.  Therefore - a test titled GRANULOCYTES - may not produce the 
desired result as it may include Basophils and Eosinophils.
 
Since the ANC is a portion of the WBC, it is only valid if it is 
traceable to the WBC sample drawn at the same date and time.  
 
ANC is a count and not a percentage - expressed as WBC with the total 
number of cells in a cubic centimeter of blood (cc) or cubic millimeter 
(cu mm or mm-3)or milliliters (mL).  Again, this number may be divided by 
a thousand for brevity.  
 
The Absolute Neutrophil Count generally ranges from 1600 to 7700 / but it 
can ever exceed the WBC count.  
 
This test can also be knows as polymorphonuclear cells or PMN's. 
 
 
Neutrophil Percent  (Neut%)
 
The Neutrophil Percent is the portion of the total WBC and that is 
composed of Neutrophil cells, excluding all agranulocytes and other 
granulocytes.  This number is usually between 40% and 70%, but fluctuates 
for many medical reasons.  
 
Since it is reported as a portion of the total WBC, it is only valid if 
it is traceable to the WBC sample drawn at the same date and time.  
 
Neut% is commonly obtained by automatic testing equipment to represent 
the Neutrophil content in the blood.  
 
Neut% is a percentage and not a count - reported in the portion of the 
WBC.  It can be converted into an Absolute Neutrophil Count in the 
following formula (Neutrophil% / 100) X WBC count).  
 
The Neutrophil Percent generally ranges from 37% to 80% and should never 
exceed 90% of the total WBC count unless special medical conditions are 
present.  
 
 
SEGS  &amp; BANDS  
 
The WBC/Granulocyte/Neutrophil cell type can be further subdivided into 
two types.  Mature neutrophils are called SEGS.  Immature neutrophils 
called BANDS also circulate in the blood until they mature into SEGS.  
The sum of SEGS and BANDS is equal to the ANC of a give WBC count.  
 
SEGS and BANDS may be reported as a count, expressed in cc, mm-3, cu mm, 
or mL.  A preceding K indicates the number has been divided by 1000.  
 
When SEGS and BANDS are reported as a number, the sum total of SEGS and 
BANDS equals the total Neutrophil Count (ANC)  NOTE that the program 
needs an identifying test for both SEGS and BANDS.  Reporting SEGS 
without a parallel result from BANDS will result in an error condition 
that may prevent Pharmacy dispense.  
 
This number generally ranges between 1600 and 7700 / cu mm.  It should 
never exceed 90% of the total WBC except under special circumstances. 
 
SEGS and BANDS may be reported as a PERCENTAGE of the total WBC.  
Therefore the total number of neutrophils (ANC) in a give WBC is = total 
WBC  X  (% Segs  + % Bands).  This calculation will be performed by the 
Pharmacy patch to obtain and ANC when necessary
 
The sum total of SEGS% and BANDS% can never exceed 100.

Information via YSSR ENTRY and YSSR RELEASE options and removes 
leftover nodes from a previous restructuring of file 604.
It also corrects a problem whereby GAF scores are not always
seen in the Encounter dialogue of CPRS.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;85</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2008-02-03 22:17:17</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Action Agenda for implementing the 
President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health recommendations regarding 
the use of information technology to enhance the care of Mental Health patients
states, "VHA should make the integration of MHA and HealtheVet Desktop (HeVD) 
an explicit goal and should provide the OI with sufficient resources to 
accomplish this goal in collaboration with the Mental Health Strategic 
Healthcare Group (MHSHG) Informatics Section.  The integration should 
eliminate the need for Mental Health clinicians to change applications.  
Further, the integration should make appropriate Mental Health assessment 
tools available to clinicians outside Mental Health (e.g., depression and 
alcohol screening instruments should be made available to primary care 
clinicians)."
 
This revision of MHA creates a closer integration with CPRS, by placing the MHA
GUI on the CPRS Tools Menu.  Additionally, functionality was created to allow 
a site to place an individual instrument on the Tools menu, allowing widespread
access to that specific instrument without having to issue the menu for the MHP
to all clinicians.
 
Additional functionality that strengthens the tie to the patient's medical 
record is the creation of a progress note in CPRS when an instrument is 
completed through MHA.
 
Furthermore, MHA maintains and strengthens its ties to the Clinical Reminders 
program, which allows for the presentation of specific instruments through 
reminder dialogs to all clinicians who resolve reminders.
 
Clinical reminders has also developed a new patch, PXRM*2.0*6 that allows 
reminders to work with the new MHA file structure.   YS*5.01*85 should be 
installed just before PXRM*2*6.  If YS*5.01*85 is installed without 
PXRM*2*6, reminders will not be able to recognize MHA instruments 
administered after the file structure changes with YS*5.01*85.
 
Additionally, the files of the MHP have been restructured to initiate the 
migration toward re-engineering and placing MHA as a component of HealtheVet 
Desktop when it is implemented.
 
To better meet the needs of clinicians and patients in different programs, 
particularly non-traditional settings, MHA can now run in a standalone mode to
administer instruments offline for later uploading to VistA.
 
VistA Mental Health Assistant NEW features in MHA3:
---------------------------------------------------
1.  M: Completely re-organized VistA Mental Health database files to 
    simplify migration to HDR. 
     
2.  GUI: MHA3 must be invoked from the CPRS Tools menu, for interaction with 
    VistA and patient selection. Patient-selection is done entirely by
    interaction with CPRS. 
     
3.  GUI: MHA3 can run in standalone mode, but only for administering offline 
    tests-which later must be uploaded to VistA.
  
4.  GUI: MHA3 allows the CPRS Tools menu to invoke any number of single types 
    of instruments, without the need to go directly to the MHA3 Main form. For 
    instance, a CAGE menu item can be added to the Tools menu, which would 
    invoke only a CAGE data entry form. 
 
5.  GUI: Major functionality (GAF, ASI, Results, etc.) is now presented on 
    individual forms, as opposed to as tabs on one main form. 
 
6.  GUI: MHA3 now provides a new Battery Wizard form to simplify creating 
    batteries of instruments.
 
7.  There is a new &amp; improved SecureDesktop component that now uses stronger 
    code to prevent hacking. 
     
8.  "Clerk entry" data-entry-mode form for psych tests has been removed. 
 
9.  All completed administrations now automatically generate a progress note 
    for review in CPRS.
     
10. All test scores are now saved in VistA, instead of calculated on-the-fly. 
 
11. There is now a hospital Location associated with an administered 
    instrument, for progress notes purposes. 
 
12. The accompanying MHA3 help file is supplied only for describing the 
    functions of the ASI Manager forms. All other tests and interview have 
    built-in help that is retrieved directly from the MHP when using the 
    "Description" pop-up menu function in the Instrument Manager. 
 
13. MHA3 now recreates a debug log file named "mha3_debug.log" for each MHA3 
    session. This file can be emailed to developers to assist in remote 
    debugging. No patient-identifying data is collected in this file. 
 
 
This patch contains 23 new Mental Health files, 58 new Mental Health
Remote Procedures, 57 new Mental Health routines, 1 option, 2 Protocols, 
1 HL7 application parameter and 1 HL logical link.
 
 
  23 New Mental Health files to be released in this patch:
  --------------------------------------------------------
  MH TESTS AND SURVEYS file (#601.71)
  -----------------------------------
  This file defines the interviews, surveys and tests available in the Mental
  Health Assistant. Attributes of the instruments include authoring credits,
  target populations, normative samples and copyright information. Actions
  available including privileging, reporting of full item content and
  transmission to the Mental Health National Database are also specified. 
 
  Entries may be made through the provided Mental Health Authoring software. 
  Direct entry through Fileman or the programmer prompt is prohibited.
 
  MH QUESTIONS file (#601.72)
  ---------------------------
  This file contains a listing of all questions for all Psychological 
  Interviews, Surveys and Tests.  This allows usage of questions by multiple 
  instruments. Each question can also linked to an entry in the MH 
  INTRODUCTIONS file (#601.73), the MH CHOICES file (#601.75), the MH 
  CHOICETYPES file (#601.751) and the Hint field (#8) in the MH QUESTIONS 
  file (#601.72). 
 
  MH INTRODUCTIONS file (#601.73)
  -------------------------------
  This file contains the introductory information given at the beginning of 
  each instrument or at the beginning of a new section of an instrument. The 
  introduction text motivates, gives instructions and sets the frame for the 
  task the patient must complete. The same introduction text can be used by 
  multiple instruments.
 
  MH RESPONSE TYPES file (#601.74)
  --------------------------------
  This file contains what type of response from the user is required for a 
  question.  Response types contained in the file include MCHOICE (multiple 
  choice), Integers, Strings, Dates, Memos and Currency.  These entries are 
  pointed to the MH QUESTIONS file (#601.72).
 
  MH CHOICES file (#601.75)
  -------------------------
  This file contains the individual selections possible in a multiple choice 
  question.  Examples are Yes or No, True or False, 1.  Abraham Lincoln, 2.
  George Washington, 3. George W. Bush or 4. Richard Nixon. For instruments 
  first defined in the legacy system MH INSTRUMENT file (#601), a single 
  character is specified for a multiple choice answer.  If George Washington 
  was the choice selected the legacy value would be 2.  
 
  Choices are pointed to by the MH CHOICETYPES file (#601.751) which is a 
  collection of choices.  Choices are referenced in the MH ANSWERS file 
  (#601.85) as a pointer to the full response.
 
  MH CHOICETYPES file (#601.751)
  ------------------------------
  This file contains a collection of choices from MH CHOICES file (#601.75) 
  and their display sequence.  This allows sets of choices to be specified by 
  the MH QUESTIONS file (#601.72).  An example of an entry would be: 1. True 
  2. False 3. Undecided  Each multiple choice question must specify a 
  ChoiceType. In this way a ChoiceType can be used by multiple instruments 
  and multiple questions.
 
  MH INSTRUMENT CONTENT file (#601.76)
  ------------------------------------
  This file specifies which entries from the MH QUESTIONS file (#601.72) are 
  parts of which instrument in the MH TESTS AND SURVEYS file (#601.71).  It is 
  the "table of contents" for an interview, survey or test. Also specified are 
  the sequence of questions and display attributes for the introductions, 
  questions and choices.  Display attributes can be bold, underlined and font
  size for the introductions, questions and choices.
 
  MH BATTERIES file (#601.77)
  ---------------------------
  This file contains a list of interview, survey and test order sets.
 
  MH BATTERY CONTENTS file (#601.78)
  ----------------------------------
  Ties the entries in the MH BATTERY CONTENTS file (#601.78) to the 
  instruments in the MH TESTS AND SURVEYS file (#601.71). 
 
  MH BATTERY USERS file (#601.781)
  --------------------------------
  This file contains a list of all interviews, surveys and tests associated 
  with an entry in the MH BATTERIES file (#601.77).  The order of presentation 
  of the interviews, surveys and tests within a battery and which battery 
  belongs to which user in the NEW PERSON file (#200) is also specified.
 
  MH SKIPPED QUESTIONS file (#601.79)
  -----------------------------------
  This file specifies the questions to be skipped (by question IEN) if a rule 
  is met for a given question in a given instrument.
 
  MH SECTIONS file (#601.81)
  --------------------------
  This file specifies sections within an interview, survey and test. The first 
  MH QUESTIONS file (#601.72) is specified along with captions (tab and 
  overall). Display characteristics can also be set.
 
  MH RULES file (#601.82)
  -----------------------
  This file contains the rules used in administering an interview, survey or 
  test. A rule is an action that is performed when a specified question is 
  answered in a specified manner. An example of a rule would be to enter 'Not
  applicable' to the Question, "Are you pregnant?" if the patient has had a
  hysterectomy. Rules are complex logic based entries that enables the user to
  create complex scripts.
 
  MH INSTRUMENTRULES file (#601.83)
  ---------------------------------
  This file ties together an instrument in the MH TESTS AND SURVEYS file 
  (#601.71), a question in the MH QUESTIONS file (#601.72) and a rule in the 
  MH RULES file (#601.82). This allows a rule to be used in multiple 
  instruments and for different questions.
 
  MH ADMINISTRATIONS file (#601.84)
  ---------------------------------
  The MH ADMINISTRATIONS file (#601.84) contains the data collected during 
  the administration of a specified instrument from the MH TESTS AND SURVEYS 
  file (#601.71) given to a patient at a specific date and time. For each 
  administration of a specified instrument from the MH TESTS AND SURVEYS file 
  (#601.71) there will be an entry in this file. 
 
  An entry in this file does not store the results of the instrument's 
  administration but is an index to the instrument's administration. The entry 
  indicates whether the instrument has been completed, who ordered the 
  instrument, how many questions were answered and if the test has been 
  electronically signed.
 
  MH ANSWERS file (#601.85)
  -------------------------
  When a patient answers a question, the results are stored in this file. An 
  entry for each question answered, in each administration is stored. Each 
  entry  has an MH ADMINISTRATON ID field(#.01) of the MH ADMINISTRATION file 
  (#601.84), a Question NUMBER field (#.01) of the MH QUESTIONS file (601.72) 
  and the response.
 
  MH SCALEGROUPS file (#601.86)
  -----------------------------
  ScaleGroups are collections of MH SCALES file (#601.87) that are logically 
  displayed together. Information needed to graph the scales are stored here.
  This includes the ordinate title, minimum and maximum values, graph 
  increments and grid lines.  
 
  All scales need to be associated with a MH SCALEGROUP to be displayed. MH 
  SCALEGROUPS file (#601.86) and MH SCALES file (#601.87) allow multiple 
  scoring possibilities within a single instrument.
 
  MH SCALES file (#601.87)
  ------------------------
  A MH SCALE is one dimension of measurement in an instrument. An example may 
  simply be a TOTAL as in a spelling test or multiple scales in a personality 
  disorder instrument (depression, anxiety, thought disorder etc.). Each scale 
  has at least one associated entry in the MH SCALEGROUP file (#601.86) and an 
  entry in the MH SCORING KEYS file (#601.91).
 
  MH DISPLAY file (#601.88)
  -------------------------
  This file contains the entries to set the Windows display attributes for 
  the MH QUESTIONS file (#601.72), MH INTRODUCTIONS file (#601.73) and the 
  MH RESPONSE TYPES file (#601.74). Windows display attributes include fonts, 
  bolding, underline, colors and columns.
 
  MH CHOICEIDENTIFIERS file (#601.89)
  -----------------------------------
  This file specifies the displayed numeric options that go along with a 
  multiple choice item.  Choice type identifiers can be numbered starting from 
  one, from zero or remain unnumbered.
 
  MH SCORING KEYS file (#601.91)
  ------------------------------
  This file contains the scoring keys.  The scoring keys are the "answer 
  sheet" for the specified scale entry in the MH SCALES file (#601.87).  When 
  an answer the matches the Target value (ie, is correct) a specified value is 
  added to the score.  An example would be: if the question is "How much is 5 
  plus 3", the target value would be 8 and 10 points would be added to the 
  total score (grade) in a ten question test to make a possible score of 1
 
  MH RESULTS file(#601.92)
  ______________________________
  This file contains results of the scored output of completed
  instruments.
  
  MH REPORT file (#601.93)
  ------------------------------
  This file contains the reporting format for a specified instrument. Input
  into this file must be entered only through the Mental Health Editor software.

      Host File name is YS_501_85.KID.  Answer YES to the question:
      "Want to Continue with Load? YES//"
 
 
   2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to install the Transport global. 
      On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
      following options:
 
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global
         Backup a Transport Global
 
 
   3. Users may remain on the system, but installation should be done 
      at off peak hours.  During testing, it was noted that if a user had 
      a reminder dialog open when the install took place, the reminder
      dialog would not load and work properly until CPRS was rebooted.
 
   4. Installation will take less than five minutes. 
 
   5. From the 'Installation Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the option
      'Install Package(s)' Select the package 'YS*5.01*85'
      and proceed with install.
  
   6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
      install//', respond NO.
      When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
      and Protocols? YES//', respond NO
  
   7. Place the MENTAL HEALTH ASSISTANT VERSION 3 USER MANUAL in a
      location that can be accessed by MHA users.
 
   8. Please refer to the POST INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS section of the 
      MENTAL HEALTH ASSISTANT VERSION 3 INSTALLATION GUIDE to install
      the MHA software.
   9. The Secure Desktop feature in the MHA software is a security 
      feature that locks down computers when patients are completing 
      assessments directly in MHA.  Because it locks down all other 
      applications on the computer when activated, it must be loaded
      directly on the PC where it will be used.  It should only be loaded
      on machines that will be used for patient administered
      assessments.  It should not be pushed out to all machines on the
      network.  More detailed information is found in the MHA VERSION 3
      INSTALLATION GUIDE.
 
   10. Place the option YS BROKER1 [YS BROKER1] on the Mental Health 
      users secondary menu.
 
   11. Enter appropriate members into the Mail Group YS MHA-MHNDB to
      the system, but installation should be done at off peak hours.
 
   12. Place the MHA application on the CPRS Tools menu.
 
   13. Create progress note title of "Mental Health Diagnostic Study 
       Note" in the progress note hierarchy.  This is needed for MHA to 
       automatically pass a note to CPRS from instrument administrations 
       completed within MHA.
 
   14. A new entry is created in File 771, the HL7 Application Parameter
       File: YS MHA.  It is exported as Inactive and should be set to
       Active after install.
 
   15. A new entry is also created in File 870, the HL Logical Link file.
       This entry is YS MHAT. The logical link named YS MHAT is used by
       the HL7 package to send VistA ADT HL7 messages containing patient
       demographics, patient administration and patient answers.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch corrects a defect in the Mental Health Assistant, Dynamic-Link
Library, (MHA DLL). The MHA DLL is called from Computerized Patient Records
System (CPRS) version 27N when a Clinical Reminder note is filled in by the
user.
  
The essential problem concerned the use a temporary file on the user's hard
drive to store user's responses before saving to Veterans Health Information
Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA). This patch provides the means
for that temporary information to be stored in VistA instead. The user is
not aware of this new storage arrangement while using CPRS and the MHA DLL.
  
There are no changes to existing files and no changes from the user's 
perspective.
 
This patch contains three new Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs):
 
   1) YTQ GET SCRATCH: Returns data from the scratch file for the MHA DLL.
      Input: DFN, test CODE and GIU HANDLE.
  
   2) YTQ KILL SCRATCH: Delete entries from the scratch file when a clinical
      reminder is saved. Input: DFN, test CODE and GIU HANDLE.
  
   3) YTQ SET SCRATCH: API is designed to set data to a scratch file for the
      MHA DLL. Input: DFN, test CODE and GIU HANDLE.
  
This patch introduces a new file called, MH CR SCRATCH FILE (#601.94). This
file is used as temporary storage space for the interface between the MHA 
DLL and Clinical Reminders.
  
A new routine, YTQPXRM8, is also included.

8. Download YS_501_98_Setup.exe in binary mode and run the YS_501_98_Setup.
   exe file to install Clinical Reminders MHA DLL. Please install the DLL
   in the default folders. The install program requires two dialogs of the
   user (to start and to signify finished). To avoid the user/install
   interaction, the file YS_MHA_A.dll can be copied directly to the
   C:\Programs Files\Vista\Common Files directory. This may be the more
   desirable way to push the dll to many workstations.
