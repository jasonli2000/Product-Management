<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch modifies the routine ^SROCODE used for flagging anesthesia
agents. With the release of Pharmacy Data Management V. 1.0, existing
calls to the Inpatient Medications routine ^PSGIU will be replaced by
the Pharmacy Data Management routine ^PSSGIU.  This modification allows
the function to work with or without the installation of Pharmacy
Data Management V. 1.0.
 
This patch also modifies the routine ^SROXR1 which is used for canceling
IV orders upon start of a surgical procedure. This routine has been
enhanced to create a background task for performing this function.

This patch contains modifications to routines used to file information to
OE/RR. Changes will allow the software to function in it's current form
when using Order Entry/Results Reporting V2.5, but will inactivate the
interface for sites using CPRS and Order Entry/Results Reporting V3.0. The
interface for Surgery used within Order Entry/Results Reporting V2.5 is
not supported with CPRS and Order Entry/Results Reporting V3.0, causing
errors when using the Surgery software.
 
At the time of release of this patch, it is unclear when the interface
between Surgery and Order Entry/Results Reporting will be reestablished. A
future patch will be necessary when that time comes.

 This patch contains a new option [SR BLOOD PRODUCT VERIFICATION] within
 the VistA Surgery package which will be used for transfusion error risk
 management. The new option is contained on the Surgery "Operations Menu".
 The option performs the following function; after scanning the blood unit
 ID, the software will check for an association with the patient
 identified. If there are multiple entries with the Unit ID scanned, these
 entries will be listed along with the Blood Component, Patient
 Associated, and Expiration Date. The user will then be prompted to select
 the one that matches the blood product about to be administered.  If the
 selected product is not associated with the patient identified, the
 warning message will be displayed.
 
 A new option called [SR BLOOD PRODUCT VERIFY AUDIT] is included to allow
 auditing of the option above. It has been placed on the "Chief of Surgery
 Menu" on the "Management Reports Menu".
 
 After installing this patch, IRM needs to turn on the KERNEL Audit Option
 by invoking the option, [XUAUDIT] for the new option exported with this
 patch [SR BLOOD PRODUCT VERIFICATION]. The expiration date for the audit
 should be set to a date 100 years into the future.

STROKE/CVA field (#256) was answered "YES".
 
2. This patch updates the cardiac assessment transmission routines
(SROATCM, SROATCM1 and SROATCM2) so that in references to the global ^TMP
the first two subscripts are a package namespaced subscript followed by
$J.
 
3. The list of station numbers that identify medical centers that perform
cardiac surgery is updated in the routine SROAUTLC, replacing 525
(Brockton/West Roxbury) with 523 (Boston).  This routine is further
modified updating several reads and writes with calls to ^DIR and
EN^DDIOL.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. The cardiac risk assessment transmission routines SROATCM, SROATCM1 and
SROATCM2 are modified by this patch to do the following:
 
   a. For both the admission and the discharge movements associated with
   the assessed operation, the entry in the TRANSFER FACILITY field (#.05)
   in the PATIENT MOVEMENT file (#405) is added to the transmission.
 
   b. The patient's address, including street address, city and state, and
   the patient's phone number are added to the transmission.
 
This patch includes a post-install process that will transmit the added
pieces of information for all cardiac assessments that have already
transmitted.
 
2. For cardiac assessments, when using the Resource Data [SROA CARDIAC
RESOURCE] option or the Update Assessment Status to 'COMPLETE' [SROA
COMPLETE ASSESSMENT] option, if the admission date is later than the
discharge date, the following message will be displayed on the screen:
 
  ***  NOTE: Discharge Date precedes Admission Date!!  Please check.  ***
 
Similarly, when using the Cardiac Procedures Requiring CPB (Enter/Edit)
[SROA CARDIAC PROCEDURES] option or the Update Assessment Status to
'COMPLETE' [SROA COMPLETE ASSESSMENT] option, if the ischemic time is
greater than the CPB (cardiopulmonary bypass) time, the following message
will be displayed on the screen:
 
  ***  NOTE: Ischemic Time is greater than CPB Time!!  Please check.  ***
 
These changes require modifications to the routines SROACAR, SROACPM,
SROACR1 and SROACOM.
 
3. The non-cardiac transmission routines SROATM1 and SROATMNO are modified
by this patch to add to the transmissions the entry in the INTUBATED ?
(Y/N) field (#42) for the principal anesthesia technique defined in the
ANESTHESIA TECHNIQUE multiple field (#.37) in SURGERY file (#130).
 
This patch includes a post-install process that will transmit this added
piece of information for all FY2000 cases that have already transmitted.
 
4. The routine SRSUP1 is modified to correct the problem described in NOIS
DAY-0200-41350.

1. When using the option Print Surgery Waiting List [SRSWL2] to print the
brief form by tentative date of operation, entering "^" to quit may not work.
(See NOIS ALB-1199-52220.)  This patch modifies the routines SRSWL12 and
SRSWL14 to correct the problem.
 
2. The Monthly Surgical Case Workload Report [SROA MONTHLY WORKLOAD REPORT]
option may generate an error if the report is run for a month prior to
October 1995.  (See NOIS TAM-1299-31004.)  The routine SROAWL1 is modified to
correct the problem.
 
3. The options Operation Requests for a Day [SROP REQ] and Report of Missing
Quarterly Report Data [SROQ MISSING DATA] are updated to make the reports
print by division.  This change requires that the following routines be
modified: SROPREQ, SROQN, SROREQ, SROREQ1, SROREQ2, SROREQ3 and SROREQ4.
 
4. When entering a request for an operation, if the normal request deadline
falls on a holiday, the method used by the software to recalculate the
deadline to allow for the holiday is problematic.  (See NOIS BAY-0100-31625.)
This patch modifies the routines SRSCAN2 and SRSREQ.  After installing this
patch, if the normal request deadline falls on a holiday, the software will
use the deadline for the closest valid scheduling date prior to the operation
request date.

1. This patch modifies the routine SROASSP adding the call to %ZISC to close
the printer device.  This change fixes the problem described by NOIS
TAM-0300-32135 and NOIS ALB-0200-51214.
 
2. The routine SRSDISP is modified to allow the display of the first 8
characters of the name of the operating room on the operating room
availability display graph.  This change is made in response to NOIS
GNH-0300-42659
 
3. The routines SROREST and SROIRR are modified to correct the problem
described in NOIS V02-0400-N0176.  When using the option Enter Irrigation and
Restraints [SROMEN-REST], if the number of active entries in the IRRIGATION
file (#133.6) or in the RESTRAINTS AND POSITIONAL AIDS file (#132.05) is
greater than 36, items will be displayed on multiple screen pages with no
more than 36 items per page.                                              
 
4. Before installing this patch, if the nurse reviewer used the option
Non-Cardiac Assessment Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA ENTER/EDIT] or the
option Cardiac Risk Assessment Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA CARDIAC
ENTER/EDIT] to update a risk assessment that was already transmitted, the
software required the nurse reviewer to go to the option Update Assessment
Completed/Transmitted in Error [SROA TRANSMITTED IN ERROR] to change the
assessment status to incomplete before updating was allowed.  After installing
this patch, if the nurse reviewer attempts to update a risk assessment using
the option Non-Cardiac Assessment Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA ENTER/EDIT]
or the option Cardiac Risk Assessment Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA CARDIAC
ENTER/EDIT], the option will allow the nurse reviewer to change the assessment
status to incomplete without having to go to another option first.  The
routine SROASS is modified to provide this change.
 
5. Obsolete code used originally to check for old Surgery Risk Assessment data
was removed from the routine SROASS.  This code was called by the entry action
of 6 options whose entry actions are also updated by this patch.  Those 6
options are listed below.
 
   Exclusion Criteria (Enter/Edit) [SR NO ASSESSMENT REASON]
   List of Surgery Risk Assessments [SROA ASSESSMENT LIST]
   Non-Cardiac Assessment Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA ENTER/EDIT]
   Print a Surgery Risk Assessment [SROA PRINT ASSESSMENT]
   Print 30 Day Follow-up Letters [SROA REPRINT LETTERS]
   Update Assessment Completed/Transmitted in Error [SROA TRANSMITTED IN ERROR]
 
6. This patch modifies the routines SRODLAY, SRODLA1, SRODLA2, SROREAS,
SROREA1, SROREA2, SRODLT, SRODLT0, SROCAN, SROCAN0, SROCRAT, SRORAT1 and
SRORAT2 allowing the following report options to print reports for all
divisions or for a selected division:
   Report of Delayed Operations [SRODELA]
   Report of Delay Reasons [SROREAS]
   Report of Delay Time [SRO DELAY TIME]
   Report of Cancellations [SROCAN]
   Report of Cancellation Rates [SROCRAT]
 
7. This patch updates the data dictionary for the following fields in
SURGERY file (#130) to require the inclusion of at least one space in

trailing zeros that cause the exclusion of such values when sorting by a
date range.  This patch modifies the routines SRSCAN0, SRSCAN2, SRSCHUN,
SRSDT and SRSRQST so that trailing zeros will be removed before the value
is stored.  A post-install process will loop through SURGERY file (#130)
and remove any trailing zeros in the DATE/TIME OR REQUEST MADE field
(#1.098).
 
2. NOIS CPH-0601-41315 reported that the Surgery Quarterly Report is
continuing to use inactive CPT codes in the Index Procedures section of
the report.  This patch modifies the routine SROQ0A, replacing the 3
inactive CPT codes (56340, 56341 and 56342) with the 3 replacement codes
(47562, 47563 and 47564).  The post-install process will task the
Quarterly Reports for the past reporting periods of FY 2001 to transmit
again.

HAM-1101-21180.
 
2. This patch modifies the Surgery software to include the Military Sexual 
Trauma (MST) classification question and the Head and/or Neck Cancer (HNC) 
classification question on the list of potential classification questions 
that must be answered on ambulatory surgeries that are passed to PCE if the 
Surgery interface to PCE is turned on and the ASK CLASSIFICATION QUESTIONS 
field (#19) in SURGERY SITE PARAMETERS file (#133) is set to YES.
 
This patch adds the following new fields to store responses to the MST and 
HNC classification questions that will be passed to PCE with the other 
surgical encounter information:
 - File: SURGERY (#130)
   Field: MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA  (#.022)      SET

                procedure is treating a VA patient for a problem that is
                related to Military Sexual Trauma.  This information may be 
                passed to the VISIT file (#9000010) for use by PCE.
 
   Field: HEAD AND/OR NECK CANCER (#.023)         SET
   Description: This field will be used to indicate if this surgery or non-OR
                procedure is treating a VA patient for a problem that is 
                related to Head and/or Neck Cancer.  This information may be 
                passed to the VISIT file (#9000010) for use by PCE.

As a part of these changes, it is necessary to convert the existing data. 
Pointers from the SURGERY SITE PARAMETERS file (#133) and the SURGERY 
file (#130) that reference the BLOOD PRODUCT file (#66) will be changed 
to actually contain the name of the product. This process will run as a 
post-install routine. A mail message will be sent to the person who 
started the installation to let them know the conversion is complete and 
any problems that were encountered. The subject of the message will be: 
SURGERY POINTER CONVERSION COMPLETED. Please note: if problems were 
encountered, the message will contain information on correcting the 
problems and re-running the conversion. However, it is not required to do 
this. Just be aware that these entries will now simply display as a

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This is an enhancement patch to the Surgery V. 3.0 software. It will
replace the existing Surgery interface with the Integrated Funds
Distribution, Control Point Activity, Accounting, and Procurement (IFCAP)
with a new interface to the Core Financial and Logistics System (CoreFLS).
Functionally, the new interface expands the features provided in the
existing interface. The interface will provide Surgery case information to
Supply Processing and Distribution (SPD) so that the specific Surgery
case carts needed for the case can be created. The modifications include
the following items:
 
1. The new SPD COMMENTS field (#80) of the SURGERY file (#130) is added to
   the following options:
 
  - Make Operation Requests [SROOPREQ]
  - Delete or Update Operation Requests [SRSUPRQ]
  - Make a Request from the Waiting List [SRSWREQ]
  - Make a Request for Concurrent Cases [SRSREQCC]
  - Schedule Unrequested Operations [SROSRES]
  - Schedule Unrequested Concurrent Cases [SRSCHDC]
  - Reschedule or Update a Scheduled Operation [SRSCHUP]
 
2. The new AUTOMATED CASE CART ORDERING field (#37) will be added to the
   SURGERY SITE PARAMETERS file (#133) input template SRPARAM so that
   this field may be edited using the Surgery Site Parameters (Enter/Edit)
   [SROPARAM] option. This field will be checked to determine if the
   CoreFLS interface for Surgery is in use at the facility before sending
   the Surgery data to the CoreFLS package.
 
3. This patch modifies all options used to create or schedule a Surgery
   case so that information can be provided to SPD for the creation of
   Surgery case carts.
 
4. This patch modifies the Surgery software to send updates to SPD
   whenever any of the information provided on the messages has been
   modified using any data entry option.
 
5. This patch enhances the following options to initiate HL7 update
   messages if the Surgery Health Level 7 (HL7) interface is in use at
   the facility for the following options:
 
   - Enter PAC(U) Information [SROMEN-PACU]
   - Patient Demographics (Enter/Edit) [SROA DEMOGRAPHICS]
   - Operative Risk Summary Data (Enter/Edit) [SROA CARDIAC OPERATIVE
     RISK]
   - Exclusion Criteria (Enter/Edit) [SR NO ASSESSMENT REASON]
   - Update 1-Liner Case [SROA ONE-LINER UPDATE]

1. This patch fixes the "NULLSUBSCR" error generated when using the PRINT
   FILE ENTRIES FileMan option to print one or more of the following
   fields in the SURGERY file (#130) if these fields contain no data:
 
   - OTHER RESPIRATORY OCCURRENCE field (#253)
   - OTHER URINARY TRACT OCCURRENCE field (#286)
   - OTHER CNS OCCURRENCE field (#343)
   - OTHER CARDIAC OCCURRENCE field (#344)
 
2. This patch adds the description to the Data Dictionary of the
   DEFAULT BLOOD COMPONENT field (#41) in the SURGERY SITE PARAMETERS file
   (#133).
 
3. When updating a Risk Assessment Status to "COMPLETE", the software
   checks for missing information and provides the ability to update it.
   This option was overlooked when doing the Race &amp; Ethnicity changes
   (patch SR*3*111). This patch removes the current checking for the RACE 
   field (#417) in the SURGERY file (#130).
 
4. When using the Print a Surgery Risk Assessment [SROA PRINT ASSESSMENT]
   option, there is a possibility of getting an undefined error if the
   length of the race data is found to be more than forty characters.
   This patch fixes this problem.

1. Surgery is using the Flag Drugs for Use as Anesthesia Agents [SROCODE] 
   option to flag drugs in the DRUG file (#50) for use as anesthesia 
   agents. This patch modifies this option to call Pharmacy Data
   Management V. 1.0 (PDM) package so that PDM possibly generates an HL7
   outgoing drug message.
 
2. When canceling a concurrent case using the Cancel Scheduled Operation 
   [SRSCAN] option, the software prompts, "There is a concurrent case 
   associated with this operation. Do you want to cancel it also? YES//".
   If the user quits using the up-arrow ("^"), the software does not
   respond correctly and subsequently errors out. This patch fixes this
   problem.
 
3. It was reported that if the Surgery case was in a requested state 
   and if an entry is made in the TIME PAT IN OR field (#.205) of the 
   SURGERY file (#130), it is found that the time gets appended to the
   DATE OF OPERATION field (#.09) of the SURGERY file (#130). This is
   causing the time to appear in the scheduling grid and prevents the case
   scheduling. This entry should be made only if the case is in a
   scheduled state or entered via the Operation Menu [SROPER] option. This
   patch provides the user the option to delete any of the following
   entered date fields as a pre-condition for scheduling such cases:
 
    - ANES CARE START TIME field (#.21), TIME OPERATION BEGAN 
      field (#.22), TIME OPERATION ENDS field (#.23), ANES CARE END TIME
      field (#.24), TIME PAT IN OR field (#.205), and TIME PAT OUT OR
      field (#.232)
 
   This functionality is added to the following options:
    - Delete or Update Operation Requests [SRSUPRQ] option
    - Schedule Requested Operations [SRSCHD1] option
    - Reschedule or Update a Scheduled Operation [SRSCHUP] option

As a follow-up enhancement to Surgery patch SR*3*115, this patch adds a 
new report option to assist in reviewing compliance with the process 
defined by directive 2002-070, ENSURING CORRECT SURGERY. Ensuring Correct 
Surgery Compliance Report [SRO ECS COMPLIANCE] option is added to the 
Management Reports [SRO-CHIEF REPORTS] menu on the Chief of Surgery Menu
[SROCHIEF] option. 
 
This report checks the two fields added to SURGERY file (#130) by Surgery 
patch SR*3*115, the TIME OUT VERIFIED field (#71) and the IMAGING 
CONFIRMED field (#72). A surgical case is counted as compliant with the 
documentation process for ensuring correct surgery if the TIME OUT 
VERIFIED field (#71) is YES and if the IMAGING CONFIRMED field (#72) is 
either YES or NOT APPLICABLE.
 
This report includes two parts, either of which may be printed separately 
or combined: 
 1. Compliance Summary - This part shows the number of cases with each of
    the possible data scenarios for the two fields in question and their
    percentage of the total cases performed.
 2. List of Non-Compliant Cases - This part provides a list of surgical
    cases that are not compliant (as defined above).

This patch is an enhancement to the Surgery software providing additional
changes related to Ensuring Correct Surgery. This patch is Phase I of the
enhancement.
 
This patch exports the following new fields in the SURGERY file (#130):
 - The MARKED SITE CONFIRMED field (#73) will have three choices:
   "Y, YES", "M, MARKING NOT REQUIRED FOR THIS PROCEDURE" and "N, NO -
   MARKING REQUIRED BUT NOT DONE (see CORRECT SURGERY COMMENTS)".
 - The CORRECT SURGERY COMMENTS field (#74) which is a word processing
   type field.
 
This patch modifies the following four existing fields in the SURGERY
file (#130):
 - A minor change is made to the description of the "NO" choice in
   the TIME OUT VERIFIED field (#71).
 
 - The PREOPERATIVE IMAGING CONFIRMED field (#72) will have three
   choices: "Y, YES", "I, IMAGING NOT REQUIRED FOR THIS PROCEDURE" and
   "N, NO - IMAGING REQUIRED BUT NOT VIEWED (see CORRECT SURGERY
   COMMENTS)"
 
 - The description of the different choices of the ATTENDING CODE
   field (#.165) is modified.
 
 - The maximum number of years of surgical residency (post graduate)
   of the PGY OF PRIMARY SURGEON field (#214) is changed from 10 to 12.
 
This patch also exports the following new date/time fields that will be
used to time-stamp when the three correct Surgery fields (TIME OUT
VERIFIED (#71), PREOPERATIVE IMAGING CONFIRMED (#72), and MARKED SITE
CONFIRMED (#73)) of the SURGERY file (#130) are entered or edited, and
they are not editable fields:
 - TOV TIMESTAMP field (#75)
 - IMAG TIMESTAMP field (#76)
 - SITE MARK TIMESTAMP field (#77)
 
These fields MARKED SITE CONFIRMED (#73), PREOPERATIVE IMAGING CONFIRMED
(#72), and CORRECT SURGERY COMMENTS (#74) are found under the following
menu options:
 - Operation [SROMEN-OP] option
 - Operation (Short Screen) [SROMEN-OUT] option
 - Operation Startup [SROMEN-START] option
 
This patch will disable the Ensuring Correct Surgery Compliance Report
[SRO ECS COMPLIANCE] option. Also, the compliance section of the
Quarterly Report - Surgical Service [SRO QUARTERLY REPORT] option will be
disabled until Correct Surgery Enhancements 2004 Phase II is released,
targeted date is June 2004.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch provides the ability to electronically sign operative reports 
contained within the VISTA Surgery V. 3.0 application. These reports
include the Operation Report, the Nurse Intraoperative Report, the
Anesthesia Report and the Procedure Report (Non-O.R.). This patch provides
the ability to view these signed reports through the Computerized Patient
Record System (CPRS) by storing them in the Text Integration Utilities
(TIU) V. 1.0 application. Tools provided by the TIU software will be used
to sign and manage the electronic documents.
 
Features provided by this patch are described in the Surgery Electronic 
Signature for Operative Reports Release Notes and in the Surgery 
Electronic Signature for Operative Reports Implementation Guide.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses follow-up issues related to the Surgery Electronic 
Signature for Operative Reports patch (SR*3*100).
 
1. Converted documents for historical surgical/non-OR cases are stored in 
   the TIU DOCUMENT file (#8925) with a status of COMPLETED, but they 
   have no signature date. Therefore, when one of these converted
   documents is printed, the following line is printed at the end of the
   document text:
 
**DRAFT COPY - DRAFT COPY -- ABOVE NOTE IS UNSIGNED-- DRAFT COPY - DRAFT COPY**
 
   This patch modifies the routine SROESPR1 to prevent the display of this
   line if the document has a status of COMPLETED. See NOIS
   FAR-0104-40622.
 
2. The input template SROARPT is used by the Anesthesia Report [SROARPT] 
   option to edit fields that are part of the Anesthesia Report. This 
   patch modifies this input template to remove the INTRAOPERATIVE
   OCCURRENCES field (#1.14) and the POSTOP OCCURRENCE field (#1.16) since
   these two fields do not appear on the Anesthesia Report.

1. RESIDENT SUPERVISION
   The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Handbook 1400.1, dated May 3, 
   2004, changed the levels of resident supervision for operating room 
   procedures. This patch implements the new levels of resident 
   supervision in the Surgery software and includes the following
   features:
 
 (a) A new file, ATTENDING CODES file (#132.9), is created to store all 
     attending codes used by the Surgery software. These codes include 
     both sets of Levels 0 to 3 (before and after patch SR*3*126, all
     flagged as inactive codes) and the latest codes for Levels A to F
     (active codes).
 
 (b) The name of the existing ATTENDING CODE field (#.165) in the SURGERY
     file (#130) is changed to *ATTENDING CODE - NOT USED and a new
     ATTENDING CODE field (#.166) is created that points to the ATTENDING
     CODES file (#132.9).
 
 (c) The patch includes a post-install conversion that loops through all 
     the cases in the SURGERY file (#130) and matches the attending code
     in the old field (#.165) with the equivalent code in the new
     ATTENDING CODE field (#.166), storing the equivalent code in the new
     field. The content of the old field is not changed by the conversion.
 
 (d) The following data entry options are updated to use the new ATTENDING
     CODE field (#.166): 
     - Post Operation [SROMEN-POST] 
     - Operation (Short Screen) [SROMEN-OUT] 
     - Surgical Staff [SROMEN-STAFF] 
     - Edit Non-O.R. Procedure [SRONOP-EDIT] 
     - Update 1-Liner Case [SROA ONE-LINER UPDATE]
 
 (e) The following report and display options are updated to use the new 
     ATTENDING CODE field (#.166): 
     - Attending Surgeon Reports [SROATT] 
     - View Patient Perioperative Occurrences [SROMEN-M&amp;M] 
     - Operation Information [SROMEN-OPINFO] 
     - Quarterly Report - Surgical Service [SRO QUARTERLY REPORT] 
       Note: The Perioperative Occurrence Categories on this report are
       updated to reflect the categories used by the National Surgical
       Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) and the Continuous Improvement
       in Cardiac Surgery Program (CICSP). Some of these categories may
       not be immediately available for selection, but will be included
       later in the NSQIP/CICSP ENHANCEMENTS 2004 patch (SR*3*125).
     - List of Operations Included on Quarterly Report [SROQ LIST OPS] 
     - Report of Missing Quarterly Report Data [SROQ MISSING DATA]
 
 (f) The patch updates the transmission of Quarterly Report data to the 
     national database to use the new ATTENDING CODE field (#.166).  
 
2. ENSURING CORRECT SURGERY PHASE II
   Phase II of the Ensuring Correct Surgery Enhancement Project provides
   the following enhancements:
 
 (a) The following new fields are added to the SURGERY file (#130):
     - TIME OUT VERIFIED COMMENTS field (#82)
     - IMAGING CONFIRMED COMMENTS field (#83)
     - MARKED SITE COMMENTS field (#84)
 
     These fields are added to capture the comments corresponding to the
     following:
     - TIME OUT VERIFIED field (#71)
     - PREOPERATIVE IMAGING CONFIRMED field (#72)
     - MARKED SITE CONFIRMED field (#73)
 
 (b) The following data entry options will be modified to include
     the new comment fields noted in item (a):
     - Operation [SROMEN-OP]
     - Operation (Short Screen) [SROMEN-OUT]
     - Nurse Intraoperative Report [SRONRPT]
 
     Entry of "NO" in any of the three Correct Surgery fields will prompt
     the user to enter the associated comment field. Entry of "NO" in
     any of the three Correct Surgery fields will not automatically force
     entry into the respective comment field.
 
 (c) Nurse Intraoperative Report Changes
     If any of the three Correct Surgery fields are not answered, the
     nurse will not be able to electronically sign the Nurse
     Intraoperative Report. If any of the three Correct Surgery fields is
     answered "NO" but does not have information in the corresponding
     comments field, the nurse will not be able to electronically sign the
     Nurse Intraoperative Report. The nurse will be able to update this
     information at time of signature without leaving the option.
 
 (d) The compliance reports, which were disabled in phase I are 
     reactivated and are modified to display the new formats for the three
     Correct Surgery fields.
 
 (e) Convert Existing Comments
     For each of the three Correct Surgery fields answered with a "NO" 
     response, the information in the CORRECT SURGERY COMMENTS field (#27)
     of the SURGERY file (#130) will be replicated in the corresponding
     comment field.
     At the end of the conversion process, this patch will delete the data
     dictionary of the CORRECT SURGERY COMMENTS field (#74) in the SURGERY
     file (#130), which was exported in phase I of the Ensuring Correct
     Surgery patch SR*3.0*126.
 
3. SURGEON PRESENT TIME ON NURSE INTRAOPERATIVE REPORT
   Patch SR*3*25 modified the Nurse Intraoperative Report so that it 
   displayed the SURG PRESENT TIME field (#.206) only if data was entered.
   This functionality, omitted unintentionally by patch SR*3*100, is
   restored by this patch.
 
4. DOCUMENTS PRINTED FROM TIU
   This patch modifies the routine SROESPR to correct a possible problem 
   if no print group is defined when a document is printed.

Prior to patch SR*3*100, the Procedure Report (Non-OR) included an 
"op-top" section that included many of the data fields documenting the 
procedure in the SURGERY file (#130) in addition to the provider's 
dictated summary, if present. After patch SR*3*100, the Procedure Report 
(Non-OR) includes only the provider's dictated summary since only the 
provider's dictated summary is electronically signed. The only way to 
review the information entered into the data fields documenting the 
procedure in the SURGERY file (#130) is by way of the data entry options 
on the Non-O.R. Procedures (Enter/Edit) [SRONOP-ENTER] menu.
 
This patch adds the Non-OR Procedure Information [SR NON-OR INFO] option, 
to the Non-O.R. Procedures (Enter/Edit) [SRONOP-ENTER] menu and to the 
CPT/ICD9 Update/Verify Menu [SRCODING UPDATE/VERIFY MENU]. This option 
will display the "op-top" information that formerly was part of the 
Procedure Report (Non-OR). The output from this option may be viewed on 
the user's screen or may be printed.  
 
A future enhancement is planned that will incorporate the "op-top"
information into an electronically signed document and thus be viewable in
the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS). At this time, the details
of this enhancement and schedule for release are not known.

1. This patch updates the Surgery Risk Assessment software of the VISTA 
   Surgery V. 3.0 application as requested by the National Surgical
   Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) Executive Committee to bring the
   VA's NSQIP module more in line with the data collected in the private
   sector. This patch also include updates to the Continuous Improvement
   in Cardiac Surgery Program (CICSP) module. 
   
   Modifications to the Surgery V. 3.0 software include:
   - the addition of 22 new fields to SURGERY file (#130)
   - the update of approximately 120 field descriptions for NSQIP and 
     CICSP data elements in the SURGERY file (#130)
   - the update of data input screens to allow the input of additional
     data elements as well as to delete some data elements no longer 
     needed
   - the addition of two new data input options, Laboratory Test Results 
     (Enter/Edit) [SROA LAB-CARDIAC] and Outcome Information (Enter/Edit) 
     [SROA CARDIAC-OUTCOMES], on the Cardiac Risk Assessment Information 
     (Enter/Edit) [SROA CARDIAC ENTER/EDIT] menu
   - the removal of the option Update Operations as Unrelated/Related to 
     Death [SRO DEATH RELATED] from Surgery Risk Assessment Menu [SROA
     RISK ASSESSMENT]
   - the update of assessment transmissions to reflect the current 
     set of NSQIP and CICSP data elements
   - the update of occurrence categories in the PERIOPERATIVE OCCURRENCE
     CATEGORY file (#136.5)
 
2. This patch will enhance the lookup by case/assessment number feature
   introduced in patch SR*3*121. Within the Surgery Risk Assessment Menu 
   [SROA RISK ASSESSMENT] option, at the "Select Patient" prompt, lookup
   by case/assessment number is allowed by entering the case number
   preceded by #, e.g., enter #6785 to go to case #6785.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Office of Information Assurance, Office of Information, Veterans Health
Administration (VHA), requested modifications to the VHA Information
Systems and Technical Architecture (VistA) Patient Information Management
System (PIMS) package that would allow for the use of multiple versions of
the code sets employed in financial transactions. This work was completed
in 2003 in the Code Set Versioning (CSV) project that was deployed in
October of 2003. CSV included the Health Information Portability and
Accessibility Act (HIPAA) stipulation that diagnosis and procedure codes
used for billing purposes must be the codes that were applicable at the
time service was provided. Four code sets, (ICD-9-CM, CPT, CPT modifiers,
DRG) for this project were modified as required under HIPAA legislation to
be date-sensitive under the first phase of the project.
 
At the time that CSV was developed, a request was made to defer
applicable text versioning to the next iteration. This deferment of the
short and long-text versions from the CSV project makes up the scope of
this Code Text Descriptor (CTD) project. This follow-up project, CTD,
intends to add the functionality of date-sensitive versioning
for all applicable code text descriptors for the four code sets, effective
with all textual changes occurring since October 1, 2002.
 
This patch addresses the changes done within the Surgery V. 3.0 software
in compliance with the CTD project.
 
The only noticeable difference users may see will occur when a specific
CPT, CPT modifier or ICD9 code descriptor changes base on the date of
operation for the case.

1. LOCKING OF SURGICAL CASES FOR EDITING
   Patch SR*3*100 introduced locking of a surgical case when a user opens
   the case for editing, allowing only one user at a time to edit the same
   case. This patch alters how surgical cases are locked and allows
   multiple users to open the same case for editing up until the time that
   either the Nurse Intraoperative Report or the Anesthesia Report is
   signed. When a user enters the function to sign either report and after
   either report is signed, the software will again allow only one user at
   a time to open the case for editing. Neither report for a case can be
   signed while the case or a concurrent case is open for editing. If a
   case is locked and another user attempts to open the same case for
   editing, a message will appear on the screen indicating the name of the
   user that has the case locked. Likewise, if a user attempts to sign 
   the Nurse Intraoperative Report or the Anesthesia Report while the 
   case is open for editing, a message will appear on the screen 
   indicating the name of the user that has the case open for editing.
   
2. ALLOW CHART PRINT OUTSIDE MAS
   This patch modifies the software responsible for printing
   electronically signed surgery reports to honor the ALLOW CHART PRINT
   OUTSIDE MAS parameter defined in the TIU DOCUMENT PARAMETERS file
   (#8925.95). If this parameter is set to YES or is null, users will be
   allowed to choose between printing a work copy or a chart copy. If this
   parameter is set to NO, only users in MAS will be allowed to print a
   chart copy and all other users will be allowed to print a work copy
   only.
 
3. QUARTERLY REPORT ARRAY CLEANUP
   This patch updates the software that generates the Surgery Quarterly 
   Report to kill a variable array that may cause problems when the
   Surgery Quarterly Report is transmitted from multidivisional
   facilities.
 
4. DATE/TIME OUTPUT TRANSFORM CORRECTION
   This patch corrects the output transform used to display the external 
   format of several date/time fields modified by patch SR*3*125. Also, an
   update is made to the way admission, transfer and discharge date/times 
   are retrieved and stored for Surgery Risk Assessment.
 
5. DOCUMENTATION ERROR CORRECTION
   The patch SR*3*100 documentation problem described in NOIS
   PUG-0604-51225 is corrected in documentation distributed with this
   patch.
 
6. FIELD DESCRIPTION UPDATE
   In the SURGERY file (#130), the CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE field (#207) 
   field description is updated with the 2004 definition.
 
7. PATIENT NAME/ID ON CARDIAC ASSESSMENT PRINTOUT
   This patch corrects a problem with the cardiac assessment printout in 
   which the patient ID is truncated if the patient's name is more than 
   16 characters in length.
 
8. NOIS SHR-0904-71756
   This patch corrects the problem described in NOIS SHR-0904-71756 so
   that the printer is closed after printing the assessment upon
   assessment completion.
 
9. CARDIAC TRANSMISSION UPDATE
   The cardiac assessment transmission is modified by this patch to 
   update the formatting of the date of death, if present.
 
10. NOIS SBY-0904-31547
   Application of this patch prevents the problem described in NOIS
   SBY-0904-31547.
 
11. ATTENDING REQUIRED BEFORE COMPLETING CASE
   To prevent possible cosigner problems with the Operation Report and 
   the Procedure Report (Non-OR), this patch will require the attending 
   surgeon/provider to be entered before the case can be completed. 
   
   When a user enters the TIME PAT OUT OR field (#.232) in the SURGERY 
   file (#130), to complete a surgical case, if the ATTEND SURGEON field 
   (#.164) is blank, the software will prompt the user to enter the 
   attending surgeon. For non-OR procedures, when a user enters the TIME 
   PROCEDURE ENDED field (#122), if the ATTEND PROVIDER field (#124) is 
   blank, the software will prompt the user to enter the attending 
   provider.
   
   If the SURGICAL RESIDENTS (Y/N) field (#33) in the SURGERY SITE 
   PARAMETERS file (#133) is set to NO, when a surgeon is entered in the 
   SURGEON field (#.14) in the SURGERY file (#130), the software will 
   enter the surgeon in the ATTEND SURGEON field (#.164). For non-OR 
   procedures, when the provider is entered in the PROVIDER field (#123), 
   the software will enter the provider in the ATTEND PROVIDER field 
   (#124).

   occurrences.
 
3. This patch modifies the DYSPNEA field (#325) in the SURGERY file 
   (#130) changing MINIMAL EXERTION in the set of choices to MODERATE 
   EXERTION. This change makes the set of codes agree with the field

This patch is part of the Patient Financial Services System (PFSS) project.
PFSS patches are being released on various schedules. Some patch
functionality will not be active until a new PFSS switch is activated
during final implementation. PFSS will initially be implemented at select
pilot sites ONLY.
 
The purpose of the PFSS project is to prepare the Veterans Health 
Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment for the
implementation of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) billing replacement
system. The project consists of the implementation of the billing
replacement system, business process improvements, and enhancements to
VistA to support integration with the COTS billing replacement system.
Significant changes to VistA legacy systems and ancillary packages are
necessary.
 
Some of the PFSS software components are not operational until the PFSS 
On/Off Switch, distributed with patch IB*2*260, is set to "ON". The ability
for the local site to set the switch to "ON" will be provided at the
appropriate time with the release of a subsequent Integrated Billing patch.
 
For more information about the PFSS project, review the documentation 
accompanying this patch and refer to the following website: 
http://vista.domain.ext/billreplace/
 
Features of patch SR*3*142 are listed below:
 
1. Modified Surgery Coding Option
   Coders currently use the Update/Verify Procedure/Diagnosis Codes 
   [SRCODING EDIT] option, which updates coded data directly in the 
   SURGERY file (#130). However, the SURGERY file (#130) does not
   currently make a distinction between procedure and diagnosis data
   entered by clinicians and that entered by coders. Today, coding a
   surgical case impacts the clinical data for the patient and causes an
   addendum to be generated because each code is directly associated with
   a free-text procedure or diagnosis entry. This patch separates final
   coded procedures and diagnoses from the clinically captured procedures
   and diagnoses.
 
   A new file, the SURGERY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODES file (#136), is
   created to store coded procedure and coded diagnosis data for a Surgery
   case. Data entered into this file will be the new source coding data
   sent by the Surgery package to PCE. In the SURGERY file (#130), the
   existing PRINCIPAL CPT Code field (#27), PRIN DIAGNOSIS CODE field 
   (#66), OTHER PROCEDURE CPT CODE field (#3 of sub-file #130.16) and ICD
   DIAGNOSIS CODE field (#3 of sub-file #130.18) are modified to include
   the word "PLANNED" in the field labels and titles.
   
   The Update/Verify Procedure/Diagnosis Codes [SRCODING EDIT] option is 
   modified to allow entry of final billing Current Procedural 
   Terminology (CPT) codes for surgical procedures and International
   Classification of Disease (ICD) diagnosis codes in the SURGERY
   PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODES file (#136).
 
   Modified features of the Update/Verify Procedure/Diagnosis Codes
   [SRCODING EDIT] option are listed below:
   - Upon record creation for a case in the SURGERY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS
     CODES file (#136), the record will be auto-populated with clinician
     entered coding data, if any, from the SURGERY file (#130).
   - A principal ICD code and a principal CPT code are initial
     requirements for coding a surgical case. 
   - An unlimited number of ICD codes may be entered for other diagnoses
     and an unlimited number of CPT codes may be entered for other
     procedures performed.
   - Each CPT code entered must be assigned the associated ICD code(s)
     related to the procedure performed.
   - An unlimited number of CPT modifiers may be entered for each CPT code
     entered.
   - For every ICD code entered, the following questions must be answered
     as appropriate for the patient based upon enrollment indicators:
     o Treatment related to Service Connected condition?
     o Treatment related to Agent Orange Exposure?
     o Treatment related to Ionizing Radiation Exposure?
     o Treatment related to Environmental Contaminant Exposure?
     o Treatment related to Military Sexual Trauma?
     o Treatment related to Head and/or Neck Cancer?
     o Treatment related to Combat?
   - Upon completion of coding for a case, the coder is allowed to mark
     the record as complete and to send the record immediately to PCE.
   - Before allowing the record to be marked as complete, the option
     checks to see if a specific code, 065.0 CRIMEAN HEMORRHAGIC FEV, is
     entered as a diagnosis code. If it is entered, the software prompts
     the user to make sure that the code is correct for the case. This
     check is added to prevent the inadvertent assignment of code 065.0
     when "CHF" is entered for the Principal or Other ICD Diagnosis
     codes.
   
2. Modified Surgery Reports and Other Options
   - The following Surgery reports and options as modified to use the
     coder entered CPT and/or ICD codes from the SURGERY 
     PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODES file (#136):
     o Cumulative Report of CPT Codes [SROACCT] option
     o Report of CPT Coding Accuracy [SR CPT ACCURACY] option
     o List Completed Cases Missing CPT Codes [SRSCPT] option
       Note: The option descriptions are updated to read "The List
       Completed Cases Missing CPT Codes option generates a report of
       completed cases that are missing the Principal CPT code for a
       specified date range."
     o Annual Report of Surgical Procedures [SROARSP] option
     o PCE Filing Status Report [SRO PCE STATUS] option
     o Quarterly Report - Surgical Service [SRO QUARTERLY REPORT] option
     o Report of Missing Quarterly Report Data [SROQ MISSING DATA] option
       Note: The Other CPT Codes no longer affect this report and 
       references to Other CPT Codes are removed. The display of "I" in 
       the footer of this report is removed.
     o Annual Report of Non-O.R. Procedures [SRONOP-ANNUAL] option
     o List of Invasive Diagnostic Procedures [SROQIDP] option
   - The following Surgery reports and options are modified to remove CPT 
     and/or ICD codes from the display.
     o Update Status of Returns within 30 Days [SRO UPDATE RETURNS] option
     o Update Operations as Unrelated/Related to Death [SRO DEATH RELATED]
       option
     o Non-OR Procedure Information [SR NON-OR INFO] option
     o Deaths Within 30 Days of Surgery [SROQD] option
     o Admissions Within 14 Days of Outpatient Surgery [SROQADM] option
     o List of Operations Included on Quarterly Report [SROQ LIST OPS]
       option
 
3. Modified Risk Assessment Options
   - Surgery case CPT and/or ICD codes used in the following options are 
     displayed from the SURGERY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODES file (#136):
     o Print a Surgery Risk Assessment [SROA PRINT ASSESSMENT] option
     o List of Surgery Risk Assessments [SROA ASSESSMENT LIST] option 
     o Exclusion Criteria (Enter/Edit) [SR NO ASSESSMENT REASON] option
       Note: The new CPT code fields will not be editable from this
       option.
     o Update 1-Liner Case [SROA ONE-LINER UPDATE] option
       Note: The new CPT code fields will not be editable from this
       option.
     o Queue Assessment Transmissions [SROA TRANSMIT ASSESSMENTS] option
   - In the following options CPT codes are removed from the screen
     headings:
     o Preoperative Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA PREOP DATA] option 
     o Laboratory Test Results (Enter/Edit) [SROA LAB] option
     o Operation Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA OPERATION DATA] option
       Note: The CPT code and Postoperative Diagnosis fields will not be 
       editable from this option. 
     o Patient Demographics (Enter/Edit) [SROA DEMOGRAPHICS] option
     o Intraoperative Occurrences (Enter/Edit) [SRO INTRAOP COMP] option
     o Postoperative Occurrences (Enter/Edit) [SRO POSTOP COMP] option
     o Clinical Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA CLINICAL INFORMATION]
       option
     o Laboratory Test Results (Enter/Edit) [SROA LAB-CARDIAC] option
     o Enter Cardiac Catheterization &amp; Angiographic Data [SROA 
       CATHETERIZATION] option 
     o Operative Risk Summary Data (Enter/Edit) [SROA CARDIAC OPERATIVE 
       RISK] option
       Note: The CPT code fields will not be editable from this option.
     o Cardiac Procedures Operative Data (Enter/Edit) [SROA CARDIAC 
       PROCEDURES] option
     o Outcome Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA CARDIAC-OUTCOMES] option
     o Resource Data [SROA CARDIAC RESOURCE] option
   - The Update Assessment Status to 'COMPLETE' [SROA COMPLETE ASSESSMENT]
     option is modified to remove the ability to edit CPT and ICD codes 
     from this option.
 
4. Functions that are currently part of the Surgery Nightly Cleanup and 
   Updates [SRTASK-NIGHT] option are modified as follows:
   - Store Operation Times function uses the CPT code fields in the 
     SURGERY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODES file (#136).
   - File Surgery Data in PCE function is removed.
 
5. The Surgery to PCE interface is modified to send coding data from the 
   SURGERY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODES file (#136). The interface now passes
   data to PCE in real time when the coder completes the coding process
   for a case. After a case is filed with PCE, if certain data passed to 
   PCE is changed within the Surgery software, the Surgery to PCE
   interface sends an update to PCE immediately. ICD coding related data 
   is updated through the Update/Verify Procedure/Diagnosis Codes
   [SRCODING EDIT] option.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. At many sites the Risk Assessment Nurse Reviewers are involved with the
Health Information Management Systems (HIMS) staff in determining the
final codes for a Surgery case. An Alert Coder Option will allow the Risk
Assessment Nurse Reviewer to alert the coder if there is a question on the
Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) or International Classification of
Diseases (ICD) codes on a Surgery case.
 
 o The new Alert Coder Regarding Coding Issues [SROA CODE ISSUE] option
   will appear on both the Non-Cardiac Assessment Information (Enter/Edit)
   [SROA ENTER/EDIT] and Cardiac Risk Assessment Information (Enter/Edit) 
   [SROA CARDIAC ENTER/EDIT] menus.
 o The Alert Coder Regarding Coding Issues [SROA CODE ISSUE] option will
   not check the PFSS On/Off switch.
 o The Alert Coder Regarding Coding Issues [SROA CODE ISSUE] option will
   display basic surgery case information including Patient, Case Number,
   Surgery Date, and Procedure.
 o The Alert Coder Regarding Coding Issues [SROA CODE ISSUE] option will
   display the following coded information:  the PRINCIPAL CPT CODE, OTHER
   CPT CODE, and PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS CODE.
 o The Alert Coder Regarding Coding Issues [SROA CODE ISSUE] option will
   allow the Reviewer to enter a free text comment field to send coding
   concerns to the coder, as well as to members of a predefined mail group
   identified in the CODE ISSUE MAIL GROUP parameter.
 o Values for the CODING COMPLETED BY field (#.01) of the CODING 
   COMPLETED BY multiple (#136.011) of the SURGERY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS
   CODES file (#136) or the CODE ISSUE MAIL GROUP will be present when the
   user selects the Alert Coder Regarding Coding Issues [SROA CODE ISSUE]
   option. If neither are valued, the user will be notified that the
   message cannot be sent without one of these two items defined.
 o The CODE ISSUE MAIL GROUP field (#43) is added in the SURGERY SITE
   PARAMETERS file (#133) to allow the site to create a designated mail
   group for the Alert Coder Regarding Coding Issues [SROA CODE ISSUE]
   option.
 o The Surgery Site Parameters (Enter/Edit) [SROPARAM] option within
   the Surgery Package Management Menu [SRO PACKAGE MANAGEMENT] option is 
   modified to allow entry and editing of the new CODE ISSUE MAIL GROUP.
 
2. When creating a request from a waiting list entry, the Surgery screen 
server incorrectly displays "SCHEDULING" in the screen header. This patch 
makes a modification to display "REQUEST" instead.
 
3. This patch corrects problems with the two trigger cross references that
were added to the SITE field (#.01) of the SURGERY SITE PARAMETERS file
(#133) by patch SR*3*150.
 
Note: This patch includes a post-installation process that updates each
entry in the SURGERY SITE PARAMETERS file (#133) as follows:
 - UPDATES TO PCE field (#18) is set to ALL CASES.
 - ASK CLASSIFICATION QUESTIONS field (#19) is set to YES.

Features of patch SR*3*144 are listed below:
 
1. The VistA Surgery software will be enhanced to request an account
   number for every Surgery Request Consult. This activity will support
   the Revenue Office's need to pre-certify with insurance companies the
   requested Surgery. A national guideline will be issued defining the
   minimum format for creating a Surgery Request Consult within the VistA
   Consults package that will collect the data required by PFSS. The
   Surgery Request Consult will not create a Surgery case. This guideline
   does not require that sites use the Consults package for creating
   Surgery requests. Sites using VistA Surgery Request options can
   continue to use that approach.
 
   VistA Surgery will be enhanced to also request a PFSS ACCOUNT
   REFERENCE, and it will be stored in the PFSS ACCOUNT REFERENCE field
   (#500) of the SURGERY file (#130). The association to a PFSS ACCOUNT
   REFERENCE is obtained when the Surgery case is created and is sent to
   the PATIENT CARE ENCOUNTER (PCE) application upon completion of coding.
 
2. This patch changes the List Completed Cases Missing CPT Codes [SRSCPT]
   option to list only those completed cases that do not have a final CPT 
   code entered in the PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE CODE field (#.02) of the
   SURGERY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODES file (#136).

Cardiac Risk Assessment Modifications
-------------------------------------
 o Modifications to the Clinical Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA CLINICAL
   INFORMATION] option
  - The software is modified to auto-populate the HEIGHT field (#236) and
    the WEIGHT field (#237) as documented in the Vitals software.
  - The Current Smoker item under this option is modified to reference to
    the new CURRENT SMOKER (CARDIAC) field (#510) instead of the old field
    CURRENT SMOKER field (#202), which will be utilized by the NSQIP
    options.
 
 o Modifications to the Laboratory Test Results (Enter/Edit) [SROA
   LAB-CARDIAC] option
  - The HEMOGLOBIN A1C field (#504) and the HEMOGLOBIN A1C, DATE field

General Surgery Items
---------------------
- Remedy Ticket #HD0000000152814
  This patch addresses two issues related to the Update Assessment Status
  to 'COMPLETE' [SROA COMPLETE ASSESSMENT] option missing items list:
  (1) For the NUM OF PRIOR HEART SURGERIES field (#352) in the SURGERY
      file (#130), the field is corrected to display "Number of Prior
      Heart Surgeries" instead of "Prior Heart Surgery (Y/N)".
  (2) For the field "PRIOR HEART SURGERIES" field (#485) in the SURGERY 
      file (#130), the data input functionality is modified to use the
      same controlled data input functionality used by the Clinical
      Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA CLINICAL INFORMATION] option. 
 
- Remedy Ticket #HD0000000177807
  After installing this patch, if procedure and diagnosis coding is not
  complete at the time the Update Assessment Status to 'COMPLETE' [SROA
  COMPLETE ASSESSMENT] option is run, the software will display "The
  coding for Procedure and Diagnosis is not complete" immediately before
  asking, "Are you sure you want to complete this assessment ?".
 
- Remedy Ticket #HD0000000185045
  When using the Outcome Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA CARDIAC-OUTCOMES] 
  option to edit the OPERATIVE DEATH field (#384), entering YES or NO 
  causes the NEW MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY field (#467) to be changed to the 
  same value. Editing the NEW MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY field (#467) field 
  does not change the OPERATIVE DEATH field (#384).
 
- Short LOCK Timeouts
  This patch updates the 1 second LOCK timeouts in the routine SROUTL to 
  use the VA FileMan variable DILOCKTM if it exists.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch adds the Transplant Assessment module to the Surgery software.
This enhancement provides the ability to create assessments for lung,
liver, kidney and heart transplants.
 
A new menu, Transplant Assessment Menu [SR TRANSPLANT ASSESSMENT], is
added to the Surgery Menu [SROMENU] option. This new menu includes the
following four options:
 
 (1) Enter/Edit Transplant Assessments [SR TRANSPLANT ENTER/EDIT]
     This option is used to enter and update the information required for
     the transplant assessments. This option also allows the assessment
     to be completed and transmitted.
 
 (2) Print Transplant Assessment [SRTP PRINT ASSESSMENT]
     This option is used to print a single Surgery Transplant Assessment.
 
 (3) List of Transplant Assessments [SRTP ASSESSMENT LIST]
     This option is used to print the List of Transplant Assessments. It
     provides summary information for assessments within the sort
     parameters selected.
 
 (4) Transplant Assessment Parameters (Enter/Edit) [SR TRANSPLANT
     PARAMETER]
     This option is used to update local site parameters for the Surgery
     Transplants Assessment module. Sites that are transplant centers must
     designate the types of organ transplants performed or assessed in
     order to streamline the transplant selection process when entering
     data.
 
- The collected transplant assessments data will be stored in the SURGERY
  TRANSPLANT ASSESSMENTS file (#139.5).
 
- Transplant Assessments Transmissions
  When editing an individual transplant assessment, upon leaving the
  final page, the software allows the user to transmit the assessment to
  the national database.
 
  o The data of the non-cardiac transplant assessments (lung, liver, and
    kidney) will be transmitted to national NSQIP database in Chicago,
    Illinois.
 
  o The data of the heart transplant assessments (cardiac) will be
    transmitted to national NSQIP database in Chicago, Illinois, as well
    as to national CICSP database in Denver, Colorado.
 
- Followup to patch SR*3*169
  This patch includes a pre-installation process that removes the
  following CPT codes from the CPT EXCLUSIONS file (#137) that were
  overlooked in the NSQIP - CPT EXCLUSION update patch for fiscal year
  2008 (SR*3*169).

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-17.html">USER,SEVENTEEN</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses one minor issue, updates the CPT Exclusion List for 
NSQIP, and modifies a data element collected by NSQIP and CICSP. Each is 
explained in more detail.
  
1. The Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA) 
stipulated that diagnostic and procedure codes and terms used for billing 
purposes must be the codes and terms that were applicable at the time the 
service was provided.
 
In October 2003, under the Code Set Versioning Project, the code names,
descriptions, inactive flags and dates were replaced by versioned data
elements, each with an effective date of use. Additionally, VA software
packages who utilize the ICD/CPT files were provided with Code Set
Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs) to retrieve the new data and
instructed to discontinue the use of the old un-versioned data elements.
 
This patch modifies the routine SROCMPED to make use of one of the Code 
Set APIs to retrieve and display versioned data.
 
2. The CPT EXCLUSIONS file (#137) stores CPT codes that have been  
identified by the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) as
procedures that should not be risk assessed. This patch updates this file
with data for fiscal year 2009.
 
3. The lower range for HEIGHT field (#236) in the SURGERY file (#130)
collected by the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) and
Continuous Improvement in Cardiac Surgery Program (CICSP) has been lowered
to account for post amputation height of patients with both legs
amputated.

FROM PACU (DPACU) time that is earlier than the PATIENT IN ROOM
(PIR) time even though the date is for the next day under the
OPERATION INFORMATION option of the NON-CARDIAC ASSESSMENT
INFORMATION. The second issue is under the same NON-CARDIAC 
ASSESSMENT INFORMATION option OPERATION INFORMATION and an 
UNDEFINED error is being generated due to an expected variable
DA(1) not being set. This prevents users from being able to enter 
a PRINC. ANESTHESIA TECHNIQUE for their patients.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;176 SEQ #169</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2012-08-29 11:14:41</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-17.html">USER,SEVENTEEN</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
In support of the VA Surgery Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP), this 
patch provides the VASQIP Increment 2 update to the Veterans Health 
Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Surgery package.
The updates include the addition of new data fields, changes to existing
fields, changes to data entry screens, changes to reports, changes to the
Surgery Risk Assessment transmissions, and changes to transplant
components of the VistA Surgery application.
 
 1. Surgery Cancellation Modifications
   a. Surgery cancellation functionality is modified so that any surgery 
      case that is placed on the surgery schedule and then cancelled will 
      be retained in the SURGERY file (#130) as a cancelled case
      regardless of when the case is cancelled. Also, a cancellation
      reason is required for every cancellation. Any scheduled case that
      is cancelled will be counted as a cancellation on the Report of
      Cancellations generated by the Report of Cancellations [SROCAN]
      option.
 
   b. The Report of Cancellations, generated by the Report of 
      Cancellations [SROCAN] option, is modified to group patient data 
      together within specialty so that all cases for a single patient
      will be shown together. The report will also order based on 
      operations so the same operation descriptions will show next to each
      other for the same patient.  
 
 2. Miscellaneous Additions to Risk Assessment Transmissions
   a. The name of the operating room as defined in the HOSPITAL LOCATION 
      file (#44) is added to each cardiac and non-cardiac risk assessment 
      transmission and to each 1-liner case transmission.
 
   b. The following four fields in the SURGERY file (#130) are added to
      each 1-liner case transmission and to the list of items checked for
      by the List of 1-Liner Cases Missing Information which is one of the
      reports generated by the List of Surgery Risk Assessments [SROA
      ASSESSMENT LIST] option:
       - TIME OPERATION BEGAN (#.22)
       - TIME OPERATION ENDS (#.23)
       - TIME PAT IN OR (#.205)
       - TIME PAT OUT OR (#.232)
 
 3. Positive Drug Screening
    A new POSITIVE DRUG SCREENING  field (#618) is added to the SURGERY 
    file (#130). This field is added to the Preoperative Information 
    (Enter/Edit)[SROA PREOP DATA] option, the Clinical Information 
    (Enter/Edit)[SROA CLINICAL INFORMATION] option and the Print a Surgery
    Risk Assessment [SROA PRINT ASSESSMENT] option. This field is also
    added to the cardiac and non-cardiac risk assessment transmissions and
    is added to the list of missing items functionality.
 
 4. Consolidation of Shared Cardiac, Non-Cardiac and Transplant Fields
    This patch updates various fields in the SURGERY file (#130) and in
    the SURGERY TRANSPLANT ASSESSMENTS file (#139.5) as well as various
    occurrence category descriptions in the PERIOPERATIVE OCCURRENCE
    CATEGORY file (#136.5) so that common items share common definitions.
    This patch also replaces various fields with new fields in order to
    enhance and refine certain data elements that are in common with
    cardiac and non-cardiac risk assessments and transplant assessments.
    All the associated data input options, assessment printouts and
    transmissions are updated accordingly.
    
    The complete list of updated fields, new fields and replaced 
    fields is in the patch release notes.
    
 5. Add Serial Number for Prosthesis Items
     - Two new fields, LOT NUMBER (#11) and SERIAL NUMBER (#12) are 
       added to the PROSTHESIS INSTALLED multiple field (#.47, sub-file 
       #130.01) to replace the existing LOT/SERIAL NO field (#2.5). The 
       Operation [SROMEN-OP] option and the Nurse Intraoperative Report 
       [SRONRPT] option are updated to allow editing and display of these
       two new fields.
     - LOT NUMBER field (#8) and SERIAL NUMBER field (#9) are added to
       the PROSTHESIS file (#131.9). The Update Site Configurable Files
       [SR UPDATE FILES] option is modified to allow editing of these new
       fields and to disallow editing of the LOT/SERIAL NO field (#4) and
       the STERILE CODE field (#3).
       
 6. Flash Sterilization
    Six new fields are added to the SURGERY file (#130) to document the
    number of episodes of each type of flash sterilization that happened
    for an operation:
     - FLASH-CONTAMINATION (#619)
     - FLASH-SPD/OR MGT ISSUE (#620)
     - FLASH-EMERGENCY CASE (#621)
     - FLASH-NO BETTER OPTION (#622)
     - FLASH-LOANER INSTRUMENT (#623)
     - FLASH-DECONTAMINATION (#624)
       
    The Post Operation [SROMEN-POST] option and the Nurse Intraoperative
    Report [SRONRPT] option are updated to allow editing and display of
    these two new fields.
    
 7. 30-Day Readmission
    This patch creates a transmission report that lists inpatient 
    surgery cases which were followed by the patient being readmitted 
    within 30 days of discharge. This report is run by the Surgery 
    Nightly Cleanup and Updates [SRTASK-NIGHT] option and will transmit to
    the VASQIP database automatically each quarter.
    
 8. Update ICD9 to ICD
    References to ICD9 are replaced with ICD in the following menu 
    options:
     - CPT/ICD9 Coding Menu [SRCODING MENU]
     - CPT/ICD9 Update/Verify Menu [SRCODING UPDATE/VERIFY MENU]
     - Update/verify Procedure/Diagnosis Codes [SRCODING EDIT]
    
 9. Remove Quarterly Report References
   a. References to "Quarterly Report" are removed from the Deaths Within
      30 Days of Surgery [SROQD] option.
 
   b. The routines that provided the Surgery Quarterly Report
      functionality are removed. Those routines are SROQ1, SROQ1A, SROQ2,
      SROQM, SROQM0, SROQM1 and SROQT.
 
10. Add Superficial Incisional SSI to Cardiac Outcomes
    The SUPERFICIAL INCISIONAL SSI field (#248) in the SURGERY file 
    (#130) is added to the Outcome Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA 
    CARDIAC-OUTCOMES] option, the cardiac assessment transmission and to 
    the cardiac assessment printout.
 
11. The following routines associated with obsolete functionality are 
    removed: SROAC, SROAC1, SROAC2, SROACCR, SROACRC, SROACS, SROASWAP,
    SROASWP, SROASWP0, SROASWP1, SROASWP2, SROAWSP3, SROASWPD, SRSLOOK,
    and SRSLOOK1.
    
12. This patch fixes the issue reported by Remedy ticket #528445, where 
    the PREOPERATIVE IMAGES CONFIRMED field (#606) displays the same data
    as MARKED SITE CONFIRMED field (#605).
 
13. This patch updates the CPT EXCLUSIONS file (#137) with data for 
    fiscal year 2012.
