<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;19</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1996-09-24 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch fixes several problems: 
 
1.  When an audit flag on a field is EDITED OR DELETED, the field gets 
audited when there is no pre-existing data and the field is being stuffed 
using /// or //// syntax. This patch corrects the problem by not auditing 
fields with no pre-existing data and the audit flag is EDITED OR DELETED.
This problem was reported by nois ISA-0593-10022. (DIE, DIEZ2) 
 
2.  When a compiled input template contains the syntax '////@', the '@' is
stuffed in the field.  This was reported in the FB VENDOR UPDATE template
in file 161.2.  This template needs to be recompiled after this patch is
installed.  (DIEZ2) 
 
3.  On a range read, an input that is totally outside of the range is 
accepted.  For example, using a DIR call like this, S DIR(0)="L^1:4", if
the user typed in 5-6, Y comes back as 4.  (DIR3)
 
4.  With the release of V21, set-of-code processing within ^DIE was
enhanced to make input to set-of-code single-valued-fields case
insensitive.  This change however caused the syntax
'field///external_code' to fail when the 'external_code' is an exact match
to a code but is also a partial match to another code.  Prior to V21, the
first match to 'external_code' was selected. This patch fixes this
problem.  The related nois is ISW-0895-21058.  There are no known
templates that needed to be recompiled at this time.  (DIED, DIEZ1, DIR1)
 
5.  This patch will make set-of-code ^DIR calls case insensitive unless an
'X' flag is passed.  Prior to the patch, an 'M' flag was required to be 
passed to allow case insensitivity.  This patch will no longer require an
'M' flag to be passed. (DIR1)
 
6.  Suppose a DIE call is made with DIE("NO^")="", and the template
specified in DR is compiled.
 
    a.  If the user timed out, FileMan behaved as if an "^" was entered, 
    printed the message 'EXIT NOT ALLOWED ??' and reprompted.  In 
    effect, then, the process would never timeout.  This change makes 
    FileMan exit on timeout.  
    
    b.  If the compiled template contained the .01 field of a multiple, 
    and that .01 field was the first field in the multiple defined in the 
    template, if the user entered an ^, FileMan would correctly print the 
    message 'EXIT NOT ALLOWED ??' but would take the user to the next 
    field defined in the template.  This change makes FileMan reprompt for
    a value for the .01 field.
 
    The related NOIS is BRK-0796-10872.
    (DIE17)
 
7.  Back out change to DICN made in patch DI*21*12 (described as item #2
    in that patch).  That change inadvertently made a response in a
    YN^DICN call required. (DICN)

Installation Instructions: 
==========================
  
    1.  The routines DICN, DIE, DIED, DIE17, DIR1, DIR3 are usually mapped
on systems that allow mapping, AXP sites will need to disable mapping for
these routines.
 
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This 
option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  The environment check
routine DIENV will run automatically.
 
    DIENV is sent in order to prevent the inadvertent queueing of the
installation of this patch.
  
    3.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your
system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
 
    4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
options: 
           Print Transport Global 
           Compare Transport Global to Current System 
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
           Backup a Transport Global 
 
    5.  Inhibit users from login into the system.  The consequence of
having users on the system while installing this patch are that users
editing records will get a 'source routine edited' error, the edits will
be lost and records may be left in an inconsistent state.  Note that most
of these routines are heavily used in DHCP applications.
 
    6.  AXP Sites - Place Taskman in a WAIT State.  
        MSM Sites - STOP Taskman.  
 
    7.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
option: 
           Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
           Select INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*19 
                                ==========
 
           Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu
Options, and Protocols?
 
    8.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to 
other CPUs?'.  
     Then enter the names of your other Compute and Print server(s).  
     NOTE: You will then see the following message: 
       TASKMAN is not running. You must run the routine XPDCPU in the 
production UCI for each of the VOLUME SETS you have listed once the 
installation starts!! 
 
    9.  MSM Sites - After the installation begins, you will be prompted to
enter a DEVICE.  After the device has been entered, KIDS will pause.  At
this time, you need to go to each of the CPUs that were entered in step 8,
and start a job that will allow them to receive the patched routines.  On
each one, you do the following:
    a) &gt;D ^XUP    This will set up the programming environment.  
       ======
    b) &gt;D ^XPDCPU  This starts the job that receives the patched routines.
        =========
    c) Select INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*19 
                            ==========
The installation will then continue.  
 
    10.  AXP Sites - After the patch has been installed, rebuild your map 
set.  
 
    11.  AXP Sites - Remove Taskman from WAIT State.  
         MSM Sites - Restart Taskman.  
 
    12.  Enable user's login.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch fixes the following problems: 
  
 1.  When merging data using KIDS, there is a case where existing data at
the target site gets overwritten by incoming data.  When a file being
exported contains pointers, and the pointed-to-file is being exported
as well, MERGING and RESOLVING POINTERS will cause the existing pointer
values on the first file to get overwritten by the incoming data.  This
patch fixes this problem by not overwriting existing data.
  
 2.  The DBS calls FILE^DID and $$GET1^DID return an incorrect value for a
file's READ ACCESS.

Installation Instructions: 
==========================
 
     1.  Routine mapping is NOT recommended for these routines. If you are
using routine mapping, ensure that these routines are NOT in your mapped
routine set before proceeding.
 
     2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This 
option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  The environment check
routine DIENV will run automatically.  
  
     DIENV is sent in order to prevent the inadvertent queueing of the

            Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
            Backup a Transport Global 
  
     5.  Inhibit users from login into the system.  Any user who is logged
in and using an application which uses the DBS calls $$GET1^DID and
FILE^DID run the risk of getting &lt;CLOBBER&gt; errors.  Any user using
FileMan's 'Transfer File Entries' option run the risk of getting an error
in the midst of a transfer.  A database record may be left in a corrupted
state.  Any init that may be running or any KIDS installation that brings
in data may leave the records in a corrupted state.
  
     6.  AXP Sites - Place Taskman in a WAIT State.  
         MSM Sites - STOP Taskman.  
  
     7.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
following option:
            Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
            Select INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*25
                                 ==========
  
            Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu
Options, and Protocols?
  
     8.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
other CPUs?'.
      Then enter the names of your other Compute and Print server(s).  
      NOTE: You will then see the following message: 
        TASKMAN is not running. You must run the routine XPDCPU in the

Description: 
============ 
 
This patch fixes two problems: 
 
1.  It prevents the allocation errors that have plagued PCMM sites. These  
Finder errors arose from stack overflow caused when using PCMM to lookup  
Patients. The Finder was not detecting and protecting itself from pointer  
chains that loop back on themselves, causing the Finder to go into 
recursion until it ran out of stack space. 
 
There are two other independent problems at these sites that this patch 
does not fix: the problem with WRITE commands in the data dictionaries of 
some of the files involved, which must be manually replaced by the 
application or local developers; and a PCMM bug that caused allocation 
errors when a patient lookup value produced too many possible matches, 
which is fixed by an upcoming PCMM patch. These problems were reported by 
the following NOISes: SPO-0896-50876, POR-0896-50871, IND-0796-40935, 
ALB-0796-51236, and MGY-0796-30889. (DICF, DICF2, DICF5) 
 
2.  It makes the Finder tolerate being called by the FileMan Database 
Server (DBS) when DIERR is already defined. This change is needed by 
patch DI*21*8, which is simultaneously under development. Because this 
fix changed the routine DICF, also changed by the fix to the problem 
described above, it was moved out of DI*21*8 and into DI*21*27 to make 
the simultaneous development of these two patches easier to coordinate.

Installation Instructions: 
========================== 
 
    1.  Although routine mapping is NOT recommended for these routines, 
your mapped set may include routines not usually recommended for mapping. 
If these routines are in your local map set, disable mapping for them 
before proceeding with the installation, and rebuild your map set 
afterward before reactivating TaskMan.
 
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This 
option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  The environment 
check routine, DIENV, will run automatically.
 
    DIENV is sent to prevent the inadvertent queuing of the installation 
of this patch. 
 
    3.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your 
system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global. 
 
    4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
following options:
 
           Print Transport Global 
           Compare Transport Global to Current System 
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
           Backup a Transport Global 
 
    5.  Inhibit users from login into the system.  The consequence of 
having users on the system while installing this patch are that users 
looking up records will get a 'source routine edited' error.  Although 
these routines are not heavily used in DHCP applications yet, they are 
used increasingly in new application such as PCMM. 
 
    6.  AXP Sites - Place Taskman in a WAIT State. 
        MSM Sites - STOP Taskman. 
 
    7.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
following option:
 
              Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
              Select INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*27
                                   ==========
    
              Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu 
Options, and Protocols?
    
    8.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to 
other CPUs?'.
 
     Then enter the names of your other Compute and Print server(s).
 
     NOTE: You will then see the following message:
 
       TASKMAN is not running. You must run the routine XPDCPU in the 
production UCI for each of the VOLUME SETS you have listed once the 
installation starts!! 
 
    9.  MSM Sites - After the installation begins, you will be prompted

At this time, you need to go to each of the CPUs that were entered in 
step 8, and start a job that will allow them to receive the patched 
routines.  On each one, you do the following:

    b) &gt;D ^XPDCPU This starts the job that receives the patched routines. 
        ========= 
    c) Select INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*27 
                            ========== 
The installation will then continue. 
 
    10.  AXP Sites - Remove Taskman from WAIT State. 
         MSM Sites - Restart Taskman. 
 
    11.  Enable users' login.

1.  Most of the routines included in this patch support Laboratory's
archiving functions described in patch LR*5.2*59.
 
    A.  Changes to EN^DIAXU API: 
 
With patch DI*21*8, the extract tool has been enhanced to use FileMan's
database server calls (DBS) in order to take advantage of the more
intelligent error handling in the DBS calls. This change has resulted in a
number of changes to the input and output variables of the EN^DIAXU entry
point.  
 
The complete API description is available on the Software Service web page
at URL:
http://www.vista.domain.ext/softserv/infrastr.uct/fileman/docs/pm/ft_diaxu
.htm
 
    B.  New API: EXTRACT^DIAXU: 
 
EXTRACT^DIAXU is a new entry point, introduced by patch DI*21*8. The main
new features introduced with this entry point for extracting data are:
 
     * More than one record can be extracted in a call. 
     * Subrecords can be extracted as individual transactions. Previously,
       an entire record including all subrecords had to be extracted as a 
       single entity. 
     * DBS-style error reporting is used.  
 
The complete API description is available on the Software Service web page
at URL:
http://www.vista.domain.ext/softserv/infrastr.uct/fileman/docs/pm/ft_diax2
.htm
 
2.  This patch also contains a fix for the DIVR routine.  When you use the
'Utility Functions/Verify Fields' option to check a date/time field that
can contain seconds, if the data has a time between 1 and 59 seconds after
midnight (nnnnnnn.000001 through nnnnnnn.000059) the data was flagged as
not valid.
 
3.  The DIV routine in this patch has been modified to provide a way for
customized input transforms to skip certain checks when the 'Verify
Fields' Utility Function is used.  The variable to check is DIUTIL.  It is
set equal to the string "VERIFY FIELDS" when the 'Verify Fields' option is
running.  (DIV)
 
4.  The changes made by some of the init routines in this patch are
necessary to make some corrections to FM's files.  The new post-install
routine, DIPOST, will make these corrections automatically.  IT IS NOT
NECESSARY TO REINITIALIZE FILEMAN.

Installation Instructions: 
==========================
  
    1.  Two of the routines in this patch, DIC and DIOU, are usually
mapped on systems that allow mapping, AXP sites will need to disable
mapping for these routines.
 
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  The environment check
routine DIENV will run automatically.
 
    DIENV is sent in order to prevent the inadvertent queueing of the
installation of this patch.
 
    3.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your
system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
 
    4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
options: 
           Print Transport Global 
           Compare Transport Global to Current System 
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
           Backup a Transport Global 
 
    5.  Inhibit users from login into the system.  Some of the routines
being patched are used all over FileMan.  Having users on the system
during installation could result in incomplete records or CLOBBER errors.
 
    6.  AXP Sites - Place Taskman in a WAIT State.  
        MSM Sites - STOP Taskman.  
 
    7.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
option: 
           Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
           Select INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*8 
                                ==========
 
           Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu
Options, and Protocols?
 
    8.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
other CPUs?'.
     Then enter the names of your other Compute and Print server(s).
     NOTE: You will see the following message:
       TASKMAN is not running. You must run the routine XPDCPU in the
production UCI for each of the VOLUME SETS you have listed once the
installation starts!!
 
    9.  MSM Sites - After the installation begins, you will be prompted to
enter a DEVICE.  After the device has been entered, KIDS will pause.  At
this time, you need to go to each of the CPUs that were entered in step 8,
and start a job that will allow them to receive the patched routines.  On
each one, you do the following:
    a) &gt;D ^XUP    This will set up the programming environment.
        ======
    b) &gt;D ^XPDCPU  This starts the job that receives the patched routines.
        =========
    c) Select INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*8 
                            =========
The installation will then continue.  
 
    10.  AXP Sites - After the patch has been installed, rebuild your map
set. 
 
    11.  AXP Sites - Remove Taskman from WAIT State.  
         MSM Sites - Restart Taskman.  
 
    12.  Enable user's login.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch fixes the following problem:
 
1. PCE sites have reported sluggish performance. Skip Ormsby at 
Clarksburg has tracked this to the activities of the FileMan Lister when 
it is used on the ICD9 file. The ICD9 file lacks a B index, and the 
Lister recreates and later deletes a temporary B index before each call 
for that file. The Lister should only do that when asked to use the 
missing B index, but always does due to a bug introduced by DI*21*8. 
After installing this patch, PCE's performance should noticeably improve.
 
Routine Summary:
================
 
The following routine is included in this patch. The second line of
this routines now looks like:
 
  &lt;tab&gt;;;21.0;VA FileMan;**[patch list]**;Dec 28, 1994

  DICU1          5260389         5299469         17,8,31
 
Installation Instructions:
==========================
 
    1.  AXP Sites - Although routine mapping is NOT recommended for this
routine, your mapped set may include routines not usually recommended for
mapping. If this routine is in your local map set, disable mapping for it
before proceeding with the installation, and rebuild your map set
afterward before reactivating TaskMan.
 
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  The environment
check routine, DIENV, will run automatically.
 
    DIENV is sent to prevent the inadvertent queuing of the installation
of this patch.
 
    3.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your
system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
 
    4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
following options:
 
           Print Transport Global
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Backup a Transport Global
 
    5.  Inhibit users from login into the system.  The consequence of
having users on the system while installing this patch is that users
looking up records will get a 'source routine edited' error.  Although
this routine is not heavily used in DHCP applications yet, it is
used increasingly in new application such as PCE.
 
    6.  AXP Sites - Place Taskman in a WAIT State.
        MSM Sites - STOP Taskman.
 
    7.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
following option:
 
              Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
              Select INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*31
                                   ==========
  
              Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu
Options, and Protocols?
  
    8.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
other CPUs?'.
 
     Then enter the names of your other Compute and Print server(s).
 
     NOTE: You will then see the following message:
 
     TASKMAN is not running. You must run the routine XPDCPU in the
production UCI for each of the VOLUME SETS you have listed once the
installation starts!!
 
    9.  MSM Sites - After the installation begins, you will be prompted
to enter a DEVICE.  After the device has been entered, KIDS will pause.
At this time, you need to go to each of the CPUs that were entered in
step 8, and start a job that will allow them to receive the patched
routines.  On each one, you do the following:
 
    a) &gt;D ^XUP    This will set up the programming environment.
        ======
    b) &gt;D ^XPDCPU This starts the job that receives the patched routines.
        =========
    c) Select INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*31
                            ==========
The installation will then continue.
 
    10.  AXP Sites - After the patch has been installed and IF you
disabled your map set (step 1 above), rebuild your map set.
 
    11.  AXP Sites - Remove Taskman from WAIT State.
         MSM Sites - Restart Taskman.
 
    12.  Enable users' login.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch fixes 2 problems:
 
1. This patch fixes a very specific problem with converting time at 
midnight.  The related NOIS is BTM-1095-13315.  (DIDTC)
 
2. Before this patch, %DT was accepting input that consisted of 8 or more
numerics as long as the first 7 digits formed a valid date in FM internal
format and %DT contained a "T".  For example, %DT interpreted 604011422 as
Jan 14, 2304.  This patch makes %DT reject such input.  The related NOIS's
are KNX-0396-41289 and WCO-0195-50090.  (DIDT)

           Backup a Transport Global 
 
    5.  Inhibit users' login into the system.  If users are on the
system, you run the risk of getting incorrect 'date with time'
values and/or CLOBBER errors. Due to the high usage of these routines in
all of DHCP code, it is highly recommended that users get off the system
when installing this patch.
 
    6.  AXP Sites - Place Taskman in a WAIT State.

    10.  After installing this patch, you need to move these routines
from your production account to the manager account:
       DIDT, DIDTC
       and in the manager account rename
       DIDT to %DT
       DIDTC to %DTC

 Installation Instructions: 
 ==========================
  
    1.  The routines DIW* are usually mapped on systems that allow
mapping.  Alpha sites that use routine mapping will need to disable
mapping for these routines.
 
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  The environment check
routine DIENV will run automatically.
 
    The Environment Check routine, DIENV, is sent in order to prevent the
inadvertent queueing of the installation of this patch.
 
    3.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your
system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
 
    4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
options: 
           Print Transport Global 
           Compare Transport Global to Current System 
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
           Backup a Transport Global 
 
    5.  Inhibit users from login into the system.  If users stay on the
system while installing this patch, a hard error may occur while word
processing fields are printed or edited.
 
    6.  AXP Sites - Place Taskman in a WAIT State.  
        MSM Sites - STOP Taskman.  
 
    7.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
option: 
           Select Installation Option:  Install Package(s)
           Select INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*33
                                ==========
 
           Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu
Options, and Protocols?
 
    8.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
other CPUs?'.
    Then enter the names of your other Compute and Print server(s).  
    NOTE: You will then see the following message: 
       TASKMAN is not running. You must run the routine XPDCPU in the 
production UCI for each of the VOLUME SETS you have listed once the 
installation starts!! 
 
    9.  MSM Sites - After the installation begins, you will be prompted to
enter a DEVICE.  After the device has been entered, KIDS will pause.  At
this time, you need to go to each of the CPUs that were entered in step 8,
and start a job that will allow them to receive the patched routines.  On
each one, you do the following:
    a) &gt;D ^XUP    This will set up the programming environment.  
        ======
    b) &gt;D ^XPDCPU  This starts the job that receives the patched routines.
        =========
    c) Select INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*33
                            ==========
The installation will then continue.  
 
    10.  AXP Sites - After the patch has been installed, rebuild your map
set. 
 
    11.  AXP Sites - Remove Taskman from WAIT State.  
         MSM Sites - Restart Taskman.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;20</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1996-12-24 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch fixes the following problems:
 
1.  If a form has no data dictionary fields, but DA happens to be set
before the ^DDS call, the caller could get the message 'Entry does not
exist', and the form would fail to run.  (DDS0)
 
2.  If in the Form Editor, you add a data dictionary field to the
form, but at the Field property, you enter a field number that doesn't
exist, the Form Editor went on to use the "GL" nodes in the DD as if they
were a lookup cross reference, and could pick up the wrong field.  (DDS0)
 
3.  If the last field on a block is uneditable, and you pressed &lt;Up&gt; or
&lt;PF4&gt; from another block or from the Command Line to this field, the
cursor would appear to be stuck, and would remain in its current location.
(DDS01)
 
4.  Suppose on a form you have a form-only field that is defined as
'Reachable', which means the user can navigate to the field but can't
change its value.  If the user tried to change the value, ScreenMan would 
correctly display a message that editing was not allowed.  But instead of 
restoring the original value in the editing window, ScreenMan would
display the new value entered by the user.  (DDS02)
 
5.  Suppose you have a repeating block that displays pointer-type .01
fields, and connected to that .01 field you have a pop-up page that
displays fields in the pointed-to entry.  If one of the .01 field values
in the repeating block is a dangling pointer, when we pressed return at
that record, the pop-up page would open up and display the data for the
record we last selected.  This patch prevents the pop-up page from opening
up when we press return at the dangling pointer.  (DDS1)
 
6.  Before this patch, users were not able to jump to fields with
executable captions.  This patch allows users to jumps to fields with
executable captions that are on the current page.  (DDS2, DDSR)
 
7.  Print message 'Please wait.  Loading all pages ...' in the command
area right after the user issues a 'Save' command.  If there are a lot
pages on the form, the loading process could take a while before the
'Verifying ...' message appears.  (DDS41)
 
8.  If we deleted an entry pointed to by a .01 field, we ended up with a
dangling pointer.  This patch makes ScreenMan display the internal form of
the dangling .01 field pointer, so that the user can subsequently delete
that .01, if it's on the form.  (DDS7)
 
9.  In the Form Editor, if you're editing the properties of a field on the
form, at the Caption prompt, you should be able to enter the following
shortcuts: 
 
       Shortcut        To define the caption as 
       --------        ------------------------
       !L              The Label of the field 
       !T              The Title of the field 
       !U              The Unique name of the field 
 
Prior to this patch, these shortcuts weren't working.  (DDSCAP)
 
10.  If a repeating block is used to display records in a multiple, and an
Index is specified for the repeating block, FileMan loads only those
entries that are in the index.  Prior to this patch, a hard error would
result if the user selected an entry that was in the multiple but wasn't
in the index, because ScreenMan hadn't loaded the data for that entry.
This patch allows the user to select only those entries that have already 
been loaded by ScreenMan.  (DDSM)
 
11.  Suppose you have a field with executable that calls EN^DDIOL.  It
passes a global to EN^DDIOL with formatting nodes so that the text appears
in two columns.  For example:
 
       ^TMP($J,1)=string 1 
       ^TMP($J,2)=string 1a 
       ^TMP($J,2,"F")="?40" 
       ^TMP($J,3)=string 2 
       ^TMP($J,4)=string 2a 
       ^TMP($J,4,"F")="?40" 
       
        etc.  
        
       D EN^DDIOL("","^TMP($J)") 
        
When you enter a ? at the field, ScreenMan displays in the help area the 
first 14 lines correctly, but the fifteenth line is incorrect.  The third 
screen looks like this: 
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 string 11                             string 11a 
 string 12                             string 12a 
 string 13                             string 13a 
 string 14                             string 14a 
 string 15 
 Enter RETURN to continue or '^' to exit: 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
and the fourth screen looks like this: 
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                       string 15a 
 string 16                             string 16a 
 string 17                             string 17a 
 string 18                             string 18a 
 string 19                             string 19a 
 Enter RETURN to continue or '^' to exit: 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
String 15a should have printed next to string 15, but instead printed on
the subsequent screen on a line by itself.  
  
This change fixes this problem.  (DDSMSG)
 
12.  This patch fixes and enhances the POINTER LINK property of blocks.
Suppose you want to display, in a repeating block, entries in a file
reached via a backward pointer and then from one of those entries,
you want to follow a forward pointer and branch to a page to display
entries from the pointed-to file.  No POINTER LINK syntax would allow you
to define this relationship.  The reference point for the POINTER LINK
needed to be the Primary File of the form, and the syntax didn't allow for
navigation via a backward pointer.
 
This patch introduces the syntax: 
 
       DD(file#,pfield#)  or [DD(file#,pfield#1):pfield#2...] 
   or  DD(file#,field#) 
 
to the POINTER LINK, where file# is the point of reference to start the
navigation, pfield# is the pointer field that points to the file defined
by the block's DD#, and field# is the field used as a lookup value in the
file defined by the blocks DD#.  
 
This patch also allows for navigation via a variable pointer:
 
       vpfield#:file# 
   or  vpfield#:file#:pfield:pfield#...  
 
where vpfield# is a the number of a variable pointer field.  The key 
difference is that you can specify the file# to which to navigate.
(DDSPTR)
 
13.  If DDSBR was set to "fieldId^blockId^pageId", and blockId was the
Block Name rather than the Block Order number, ScreenMan disregarded the
blockId and automatically assumed the first block on the page.  (DDS2)

Installation Instructions: 
=========================
 
    1.  AXP Sites -  The routines DDS0, DDS01, DDS1, and DDSR are
usually mapped on systems that allow mapping, so you will need to disable
mapping for these routines.
 
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  The environment
check routine, DIENV, will run automatically.
 
    DIENV is sent to prevent the inadvertent queuing of the installation
of this patch.
 
    3.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your
system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
 
    4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
following options:
 
           Print Transport Global
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Backup a Transport Global
 
    5.  Inhibit users from login into the system.  The consequences of
installing this patch while users are on the system are that users editing
data via ScreenMan forms will get a 'source routine edited' error, and
their edits will be lost, and the data may be left in an inconsistent
state.  Note that PAID is an application that uses ScreenMan.
 
    6.  AXP Sites - Place Taskman in a WAIT State.
        MSM Sites - STOP Taskman.
 
    7.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
following option:
 
              Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
              Select INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*20
                                   ==========
  
              Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu
Options, and Protocols?
  
    8.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
other CPUs?'.
 
     Then enter the names of your other Compute and Print server(s).
 
     NOTE: You will then see the following message:
 
     TASKMAN is not running. You must run the routine XPDCPU in the
production UCI for each of the VOLUME SETS you have listed once the
installation starts!!
 
    9.  MSM Sites - After the installation begins, you will be prompted
to enter a DEVICE.  After the device has been entered, KIDS will pause.
At this time, you need to go to each of the CPUs that were entered in
step 8, and start a job that will allow them to receive the patched
routines.  On each one, you do the following:
 
    a) &gt;D ^XUP    This will set up the programming environment.
        ======
    b) &gt;D ^XPDCPU This starts the job that receives the patched routines.
        =========
    c) Select INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*20
                            ==========
The installation will then continue.
 
    10.  AXP Sites - After the patch has been installed and IF you
disabled your map set (step 1 above), rebuild your map set.
 
    11.  AXP Sites - Remove Taskman from WAIT State.
         MSM Sites - Restart Taskman.
 
    12.  Enable users' login.

This patch fixes a bug in ^DIWP that started after patch DI*21*33: 
                  
Applications doing the following are affected by this bug::
              
       1.  Application calls ^DIWP with DIWL=0.
                                       
       2.  After the call to ^DIWP, application resets DIWL=0 and then
accesses the ^UTILITY global.  No text is found when referencing
^UTILITY($J,"W",DIWL.
 
The related NOIS Calls are: WPB-1296-31219 and NOP-1296-11296.
 
This patch reverses the fix sent by patch 33.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch makes the following changes: 
 
1.  Given the following: 
 
    a. You have a file with a pointer-type .01 field called NAME.
    b. NAME points to a file that has a free text field called SHORT
       DESCRIPTION.  
    c. NAME has NAME:SHORT DESCRIPTION as an output transform.  
 
    If you Enter/Edit the entries in this file and enter ^LOOP at the
'Select NAME:' prompt you can get a hard error.
 
    NOIS: KAN-0396-41540
    (DIA2)
  
2.  For set of codes ^DIR Reader calls, adds a new input array: 
 
    DIR("L",#) Only applies to set of codes.  Replaces the standard 
               vertical listing of codes that the Reader displays.  It is 
               up to the programmer to ensure that the contents of the 
               DIR("L") array matches the codes in the second ^-piece of 
               DIR(0).  
 
               The format of the DIR("L") array is similar to DIR("A") 
               and DIR("?").  The #'s must be numeric starting from 1. The
               numbered lines are written first and the DIR("L") is 
               written last.
 
    Example:
 
    &gt;S DIR(0)="SO^1:ONE;2:TWO;3:THREE;4:FOUR;5:FIVE;6:SIX;7:SEVEN"
    &gt;S DIR("L",1)="Select one of the following:"
    &gt;S DIR("L",2)=""
    &gt;S DIR("L",3)="  1  ONE      5  FIVE"
    &gt;S DIR("L",4)="  2  TWO      6  SIX"
    &gt;S DIR("L",5)="  3  THREE    7  SEVEN"
    &gt;S DIR("L")="  4  FOUR"
    &gt;D ^DIR
 
    Select one of the following:
 
    1  ONE      5  FIVE
    2  TWO      6  SIX
    3  THREE    7  SEVEN
    4  FOUR
  
    Enter response: ?
 
    Enter a code from the list.
 
    Select one of the following:
 
    1  ONE      5  FIVE
    2  TWO      6  SIX
    3  THREE    7  SEVEN
    4  FOUR
 
    Enter response: 
 
Also, for set of codes ^DIR Reader calls, this patch removes unnecessary
blank lines that appeared before and after the vertical list of codes.
 
Also, when using DIR("?") - one line help - this patch makes sure a period
(.) terminates DIR("?").
 
Also, this patch makes sure that DIR("?") is not overwritten by the
Reader's default help prompt.
 
(DIR)
 
3.  Two problems with the FIELD^DID are corrected with this patch:
 
    a.  If the FIELD^DID call was used to retrieve field level attributes
of a file with a file number less than or equal to 1, error code 200 would
be returned: "An input variable or parameter is missing or invalid".  This
patch makes FIELD^DID work for fields in files numbered 1 or less.
 
    b.  FIELD^DID returned erroneous values for FIELD LENGTH for fields
with data types of MUMPS, SET OF CODES, VARIABLE POINTER, and DATE/TIME.
This patch makes FIELD^DID return more accurate values for FIELD LENGTH
for these types of fields.
 
    (DID, DIQGDD, DIQGDDF, DIQGDDU)
 
4.  This patch corrects the problem which can be reproduced by doing the
following:
 
    (1) On the FileMan menu, select OTHER OPTIONS -&gt; AUDITING
    (2) Select Audit Option #1, FIELDS BEING AUDITED.
    (2) Pick a file that has no fields being audited.
    (3) Select Audit Option #2, DATA DICTIONARIES BEING AUDTED.
 
    An undefined variable DFF error would occur.
 
    NOIS: ISB-1096-30117
    (DIAU)
 
5.  If on a field you tried to put an output transform that looked like
 
    S:'$D(var) var=...     or
    D:'...                 or
    X:'...
 
and in the file, there was a field with a name that started with the
letter before the colon (:), an infinite loop would occur.  This patch
corrects this problem.  (DICOMPX)
 
6.  If the cross references on a file are compiled, and the file contains
trigger-type cross references, FileMan could break the routine within a do
block structure, so that the first line of the next routine starts with a
.line.  For example, the last few lines of one routine could be:
 
         I X'="" D
         .N DIK,DIV,DIU,DIN
  END    G ^zzzz2
 
and the first few lines of the next routine could be:
 
  zzzz2  ; COMPILED XREF FOR FILE #xxxxx ; 10/30/96
         ; 
         .K DIV S DIV=X,D0=DA,DIV(0)=D0 S Y(1)=$S($D(^DIZ(xxxxx,D0,3)):
           ^(3),1:"")S X=$P(Y(1),U,2),X=X S DIU=X K Y X ^DD(xxxxx,2,1,
           12,2.1) X ^DD(xxxxx,2,1,12,2.4)
         ...
 
This patch ensure that routines are not broken within do block structures.
(DIKZ)
 
7.  This patch also fixes several problems with %DT and time input:
 
    a. If only numbers are entered in the date and/or time position, like
       9999999999999999999999999999999, an illegal number error could
       result.
       
    b. Even with %DT["N", %DT was accepting noncanonic numbers (numbers
       with a leading 0).  So, 090196 was accepted, but 100196 was not.
       
    c. If only a time is input, and the AM/PM designation on the time
       contained punctuation (like 2:00 A.M.), the input was rejected.
       
    d. A single 0 in the minutes or seconds position of the time, could
       cause the time to be interpreted incorrectly.  For example, 01:0
       was interpreted as 10:00 am, and T@01:01:0 was interpreted as
       10:00:10 am.  With this fix, time with a single 0 in the minutes or
       seconds position is rejected.
       
    e. Time with hours of 0 or 00 were not getting interpreted
       correctly.  For example:
                                            Intepreted as

                       [0]0:01 PM     =&gt; 13:00:00    rejected
       
    f. T@14AM translated to 00:14.  After this fix, T@14AM is rejected.
       
    g. If %DT["S" and the time contained seconds, and there was at least
       one space between the time and the AM/PM designator, the time was
       rejected.  For example, T@1:00:00 PM was rejected, T@1:00:00PM was
       accepted. (This bug fix applies to DSM, not MSM, sites.)
 
    h. If only a year and a time is entered, %DT was accepting the input
       and echoing back a time without hours or minutes:
        
       &gt;S %DT="AEST"
       &gt;D ^%DT
        
       DATE: 1995@9  (1995@::00)
        
       &gt;ZW Y
       Y=2950000.09
        
       This change makes %DT reject this input.
 
    NOIS: MAR-0996-21548
    (DIDT)
 
8.  If the user enters something like P at the THEN PRINT FIELDS prompt, and
there are no fields that begin with P, DICOMP was looking at the "PT"
nodes to find all backpointing files that begin with P.  This could lead
to confusing messages like 'such and such pointer is not cross
referenced', or 'by ... do you mean... '.

9.  If a line in a word processing field sent to ^DIWP contains a vertical
bar, followed by alphanumerics, followed by punctuation, followed by more
alphanumerics, an undefined J(0) error can occur at DD^DICOMPV, if there
is at least one file on the system whose name starts with the characters
between the vertical bar and the punctuation. For example, the following
code produces the error:
 
    S X="A line of text &lt;vertical bar&gt;A:B"
    S DIWF="N",DIWL=10,DIWR=68
    D ^DIWP
 
if there are any files on the system that start with 'A'.

Installation Instructions: 
=========================
 
    1.  AXP Sites - The routines %DT and DIR are usually mapped on
systems that allow mapping, so you will need to disable mapping for these
routines.
 
    2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  The environment
check routine, DIENV, will run automatically.
 
    DIENV is sent to prevent the inadvertent queuing of the installation
of this patch.
 
    3.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your
system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
 
    4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
following options:
 
           Print Transport Global
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Backup a Transport Global
 
    5.  Inhibit users from login into the system.  Some of the routines in
this patch are used heavily in DHCP applications, most notably %DT and
DIR. The consequences of installing this patch while users are on the
system are that users may get a 'source routine edited' error.  Due to the
high usage of these routines in all of DHCP code, it is highly recommended
that users be off the system when installing this patch.
 
    6.  AXP Sites - Place Taskman in a WAIT State.
        MSM Sites - STOP Taskman.
 
    7.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
following option:
 
              Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
              Select INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*24
                                   ==========
  
              Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu
Options, and Protocols?
  
    8.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
other CPUs?'.
 
        Then enter the names of your other Compute and Print server(s).
 
        NOTE: You will then see the following message:
 
        TASKMAN is not running. You must run the routine XPDCPU in the
production UCI for each of the VOLUME SETS you have listed once the
installation starts!!
 
    9.  MSM Sites - After the installation begins, you will be prompted
to enter a DEVICE.  After the device has been entered, KIDS will pause.
At this time, you need to go to each of the CPUs that were entered in
step 8, and start a job that will allow them to receive the patched
routines.  On each one, you do the following:
 
    a) &gt;D ^XUP    This will set up the programming environment.
        ======
    b) &gt;D ^XPDCPU This starts the job that receives the patched routines.
        =========
    c) Select INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*24
                            ==========
The installation will then continue.
 
    10.  After installing this patch, you need to move routine DIDT
from your production account to the manager account.  Then, in the manager
account, rename:
 
         DIDT to %DT
      
         Example: ZL DIDT ZS %DT
 
    11.  AXP Sites - After the patch has been installed, rebuild your map
set.
 
    12.  AXP Sites - Remove Taskman from WAIT State.
         MSM Sites - Restart Taskman.
 
    13.  Enable users' login.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch fixes 4 problems: 
 
1.  In a KIDS build entry, one can send data with a file.  The field 'Data
List' may contain the name of a Search or Inquire Template.  If several
files in a BUILD entry use the same template name the DIFROM Server
correctly processes only the first file's template.  The subsequent
files' templates are processed incorrectly and it could abort the building
of a transport global. (DIFROMSU)
 
2.  When the DIFROM Server installs Data Dictionaries, it's possible that
the 'I' specifier on the file's data global 0 node could be deleted.  This
prevents 'Identifiers' from getting displayed.  This was reported on NOIS
STC-0596-40915.  (DIFROMSS) 
 
3.  When a word processing window can't be resolved by FileMan during any
FM output, a hard error occurs.  This patch fixes this problem.  This was
reported on NOIS SFC-0395-60476. (DIWW)
 
4.  When FileMan tries to resolve a word processing window with multiple 
arguments via a call to ^DIWP, a hard error occurs.  (DICOMP)

Prerequisites:
==============
 
Progress Notes patch GMRP*2.5*46 should be installed at the same time as
this FileMan patch.  Below is a brief description of that patch.  If the
Progress Notes patch is not installed, it will result only in a minor
annoyance as described, but will not affect any data.
 
 
If FileMan patch DI*21*29 is installed without installing patch
GMRP*2.5*46, and if the site has the 'ASK TITLE OK?' parameter in file
121.99 (field 3.5) turned on and the user does the lookup on the title
file by Internal Entry Number (IEN) the '...OK? YES//' prompt will be
displayed twice.
 
After GMRP*2.5*46 has been installed, the user will only be prompted once
under those conditions.
 
 
 
Patch Description
=================
 
This patch fixes many bugs and makes some minor enhancements in the
FileMan lookup (^DIC, IX^DIC and MIX^DIC1) entry points.
 
The patch addresses the following NOIS and E3R:

In addition, the patch fixes the following bugs/shortcomings reported in
mail messages and not through the NOIS or E3R system.:
 
ONLINE HELP/PROMPTS:
 
  a) Question mark help on a set of codes wasn't right aligning the
external value of the possible choices in the display.  Reported by Cathy
Williamson (Hines IRMFO).
 
  b) If adding a new entry failed due to failure during execution of a
LAYGO node on the file, or because the file is restricted from editing
(such as an archive file), FileMan quit without giving any indication. Now
it will question mark beep so user knows something went wrong.  Reported
locally by Don Creaven.
 
  c) When doing a lookup on a multiple field with a whole-file
cross-reference (like a SYNONYM multiple), the entry from the x-ref was
being displayed, but not the .01 at the top level of the selected entry.
Reported by Robert Melmoth (Hines IFMRO).
 
  d) When doing a lookup on some index other than the .01, only the value
from the index is displayed, and not the value of the .01 field itself.
Reported by Tom Ash (Montgomery)
 
  e) A new field SHORT DESCRIPTION was added to the DIALOG file.  A WRITE
identifier was added to display this field on lookup.  Suggested by Mike
Kilmade.
 
 
HARD ERRORS:
 
  a) Bad variable name error at NAME+1^DICM2, when displaying DIC("B")
default value when following a pointer to a variable pointer.  Reported by
Mary Ann Ferrarese in Record Tracking.
 
  b) NOPEN error when job is queued with no device, DIC(0)["Q" and lookup
fails.  It tried to write #7,??.  Reported by Skip Ormsby (Clarksburg
VAMC).
 
  c) UNDEF error at R+1^DIC2 when a cross-reference entry exists but no
corresponding entry exists in the data.  Found during testing of FileMan
21 at Oklahoma City VAMC.
 
  d) UNDEF error in ALL^DICM2 was caused when we had a file with the .01
field a variable pointer, the .01 field of the first pointed-to file is a
pointer, user selects the value on the pointed-to file, presses return
when matches on the home file are selected, then FileMan starts to look at
the second file pointed-to by the variable pointer.  Found by Tom
Ackerman.
 
 
LOOKUPS USING POINTER FIELDS:
 
  a) Fixed a lookup problem in Social Work Case File (650) reported by
Kevin McGee, San Francisco VAMC. Lookup with lower case letter + last 4
digits SSN was very slow, and could potentially fail to find a valid match
as well.
 
 
LOOKUPS WHERE DIC(0)["N":
 
  a) When FileMan does a lookup by IEN because DIC(0)["N" and it can find
no other matches, make it ask OK?...  Reported by Clayton Curtis as a
MailMan bug when he accidently entered a number at the recipient prompt
(in an attempt to edit a line number of the message.).
 
 
VARIABLE PRESERVATION,CLEANUP,OUTPUT:
 
  a) Users lookup value X wasn't being protected while executing
IDENTIFIER logic.  Reported by George Huggins, Indian Health Service.
 
  b) When user was entering a new entry with DIC(0)'["A", and up-arrowed
out either during the entry of a required IDENTIFIER, or at the 'Are you
Adding...' message, FileMan wasn't setting output variable DUOUT. Reported
by Robert Whelan, Albany IRMFO.
 
  c) UTILITY option to EDIT a file wasn't cleaning up the DR variable at
the end.  If the PRINT option was run immediately afterwards, it tried to
use DR as an input variable with unexpected results.  Reported by Skip
Ormsby, Clarksburg VAMC.
 
 
MIX^DIC1 AND IX^DIC CALLS:
 
  a) Honor cross-reference list D in an MIX^DIC1 call, when FileMan goes
off to look on cross-references for pointer, date, set and variable
pointer fields on the home file, transforms lookup value from lower to
upper case, and other types of transforms.  Previously FileMan was looking
at all x-refs during this part of the logic.  Reported by Greg Kreis.
 
  b) Using the MIX^DIC1 call, if one of the x-refs in input variable "D"
is on a pointer field, we do a lookup in the pointed-to file.  FileMan was
still using the list of indexes in "D" on the pointed-to file, even though
they only had meaning in the original home file. Reported by Tom Love
(Indian Health Service).
 
  c) If developer did an MIX^DIC1 or IX^DIC call with D containing a
cross-reference before "B" (ex. "AC"), and lookup value was a pointer,
set, variable pointer or date, then lookup could only find the entry by
its internal value.  Reported by Greg Kreis.
 
 
PROBLEMS WITH PARTIAL MATCHING:
 
  a) Problem stuffing the .01 field of a multiple with "///" in an input
template, when field is defined as a date with time. When user enters a
date with time as a lookup value, FileMan converts it to its FileMan
internal value, then if it finds a partial match to that date/time,
considers that to be a match.  If there is just one partial match, this
entry is selected.  This was a problem when user was trying to stuff a
date/time entry into a multiple with the 3 slash syntax.  The fix is for
FileMan to automatically put an X into DIC(0), thus forcing exact matches
only, when the 3 slash syntax is used in an input template.  Found by
Cindy Heuer (Hines IRMFO) in Radiology.
 
  b) FileMan did not properly find partial matches to a numeric lookup
value, if the value in the index was alpha-numeric, but started with a
number containing decimals.  This was found at Tucson VAMC by Jim Orrey.
They had a file where entries contained rational numbers, but they had
created an index with a trailing blank, in order to force string
collation.
 
  c) If .01 field is longer than 30 characters, user enters a lookup value
greater than 30 characters in lower or mixed case, FileMan failed to find
valid matches to the lookup value.  Reported by Dave Bolduc (AIMC
programmer)
 
 
PROBLEMS ADDING NEW RECORDS:
 
  a) If a process held onto a LOCK on what would have been the next record
to be added to a file before incrementing the next record number count in 
the header node, any other process trying to add an entry to that file
would get stuck in an infinite loop (unless/until the first process
released its lock).
 
  b) If, contrary to the instruction on page 65 of the FileMan version 21 
Programmers Reference Manual, a routine called FILE^DICN with the local 
variable DD set equal to "B", or the name of some other index in the data 
file, or the record number of an existing record, or 0, that routine would
get stuck in an infinite loop.
  
  c) If a routine called FILE^DICN with DD set to some other value, the
new record would be added to the file with that as its record number, even
if DD's value was not a legal record number. This erroneous behavior even
overrode the use of DINUM.
 
 
 
In addition, a new flag DIC(0)["B" was added.  The purpose of the flag is
to restrict FileMan to looking only on the "B" index of any files
pointed-to by the file in which you're doing the lookup.  The complete API
description is available in HTML format at:

 Installation Instructions: 
 ==========================
   
     1.  The routines DIC, DIC1, DIC2, DICM, DICM0, DICM2, DICM3, DICN,
DICN1, DICQ, DICQ1, DIE1, DIE17 and DIOU are usually mapped on systems
that allow mapping, AXP sites will need to disable mapping for these
routines.
  
     2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  (The environment
check routine DIENV will run automatically.  DIENV is sent in order to
prevent the inadvertent queueing of the installation of this patch.)
  
     3.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your
system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
     4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
following options:
            Print Transport Global 
            Compare Transport Global to Current System 
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
            Backup a Transport Global 
  
     5.  Inhibit users from login into the system.  The consequence of
having users on the system while installing this patch are that users
adding or editing records will get a 'source routine edited' error, the
edits will be lost and records may be left in an inconsistent state.  Note
that most of these routines are heavily used in DHCP applications.
  
     6.  AXP Sites - Place Taskman in a WAIT State.  
         MSM Sites - STOP Taskman.  
 
     7.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
following option:
            Select Installation Option: Install Package(s) 
            Select INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*29 
                                 ==========
  
            Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu
Options, and Protocols?
  
     8.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
other CPUs?'. Then enter the names of your other Compute and Print
server(s).  NOTE: You will then see the following message:
   TASKMAN is not running. You must run the routine XPDCPU in the
production UCI for each of the VOLUME SETS you have listed once the
installation starts!!
  
     9.  MSM Sites - After the installation begins, you will be prompted
to enter a DEVICE.  After the device has been entered, KIDS will pause. At
this time, you need to go to each of the CPUs that were entered in step 8,
and start a job that will allow them to receive the patched routines.  On
each one, you do the following:
 
     a) &gt;D ^XUP    This will set up the programming environment.

  Patch Description: 
  ============
  This patch fixes a rare bug.  An UNDEF error can occur if user does a
queued print of a JOIN EXTENDED POINTER computed field in a file.  Patch
DI*21*29 killed Y in ^DIC, before resetting Y to the documented output
value. This happens only when ^DIC was called from a queued job.  In most
cases this causes no problems, however, subscripted values of the variable
Y are used in the computed field logic of JOIN EXTENDED POINTER type
computed fields, causing an UNDEF error when these fields are printed in a
queued print job. This patch corrects the problem.
  
  
  
  Routine Summary:

  Installation Instructions: 
  ==========================
    
      1.  The routine DIC is usually mapped on systems that allow mapping,
AXP sites will need to disable mapping for this routine.
  
      2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
 option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  (The environment
check routine DIENV will run automatically.  DIENV is sent in order to
prevent the inadvertent queueing of the installation of this patch.)
 
      3.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your
system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
   
      4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
following options:
   Print Transport Global 
   Compare Transport Global to Current System 
   Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
   Backup a Transport Global 
   
      5.  Inhibit users from login into the system.  The consequence of
having users on the system while installing this patch are that users
adding or editing records will get a 'source routine edited' error, the
edits will be lost and records may be left in an inconsistent state.  Note
that this routine is heavily used in DHCP applications.

 Description:
 ============
 
      This patch changes two different features of FileMan in important
      ways. The changes are to 1) how the Finder DBS call processes
      commas in lookup values, and 2) the order in which cross-
      references fire during reindexing. Although these changes are NOT
      backward-compatible, they have not disrupted sites we've tested
      at, and provide a great deal of benefit in return.
 
      For a complete explanation, please read this description
      carefully. Because these changes are not backward-compatible, we
      have taken time to explain the reasons and effects in detail. For
      more information on these changes, send email to
      G.FMTEAM@DOMAIN.EXT, or call Rick Marshall at 206-764-2283.
      Please notify us immediately if you experience any ill effects
      from either of these changes.
 
      Change 1: Finder and Comma-Piecing
      ----------------------------------
      The Finder, like the classic DIC Lookup call, processes lookup
      values that contain commas specially. We have reduced the power of 
      the Finder's algorithm in order to buy a substantial performance 
      gain, and have introduced a new "C" flag to allow callers to get 
      the full power of the original algorithm when they need it. DIC's 
      algorithm has not been changed, which means DIC and the Finder do 
      not handle commas the same way unless you include the "C" flag in 
      your Finder call.
 
      The need to make this backward-incompatible change arises from 
      another difference between the classic DIC lookup and the Finder: 
      short-circuiting. In general, the Finder call was designed to 
      emulate the DIC lookup, but one feature of DIC caused a great deal 
      of confusion: the way DIC short-circuits its lookup whenever it 
      has possible matches. DIC rarely presents all of the matches 
      available, but instead at fixed points during the lookup will quit 
      early if it has any matches. This feature is designed to focus the 
      lookup on what DIC considers the most likely matches, but many 
      users report they find the behavior counter-intuitive.
 
      For this reason, the Finder was designed to always locate all 
      possible matches, to avoid short-circuiting out of the lookup 
      early. Since the Finder always runs all relevant parts of the 
      lookup algorithm, it always pays the performance costs of those 
      parts. Comma-piecing, a powerful but expensive part of DIC's 
      lookup, was usually short-circuited out of DIC's main lookup, but 
      in the Finder, of course, is always run on lookup values 
      containing commas. Thus, with values containing commas, the Finder 
      is usually much slower than DIC.
 
      The Imaging project, in particular, discovered that the 
      performance cost was too much to pay, and asked the FileMan team 
      to change the Finder's behavior. Although comma-piecing is 
      documented (FileMan 21 Programmer Manual, pages 208-209, and 
      FileMan 21 User Manual, page 12 ("^ST,ADD" in part 3)), most users 
      polled do not realize the full power of this feature, but believe 
      it has a limited capability specific to names. Although the 
      FileMan team rarely considers making backward-incompatible 
      changes, in this case most experts were unaware of and therefore 
      not relying on the parts of this algorithm that made it expensive. 
      In return for making this change, lookups at Houston VAMC 
      involving values containing commas passed to the Finder that used 
      to take 90 seconds now take 4. The sheer magnitude of the trade-
      off led us to reduce the power of comma-piecing Finder lookups to 
      what people have known about, while adding the "C" flag for those 
      who know about and need the full power.
 
      Most users and developers believe comma piecing is specifically 
      used with names, so that a lookup values like "DI,MI" will match 
      "DISTASO,MICHAEL" and "DISNEY,MICHELLE". In other words, the comma 
      in the lookup value stands for a real comma in the index value, 
      and a partial match is run on both the first and last names. This 
      is what the Finder has been changed to do.
 
      What comma-piecing does in DIC, what it did in the Finder before 
      this patch, and what the Finder does after this patch if the "C" 
      flag is passed is far more powerful. The comma stands for any 
      arbitrary string of characters followed by any punctuation 
      character. "DI,MI" then will match not just the values most users 
      expect, but also "DISTASO,XACHARY MICHAEL" and "DINNER WITH 
      MICHAEL". This is the principle behind the "^ST,ADD" example in 
      the FileMan 21 User Manual. This feature requires a tremendous 
      amount of processing, but yields far more flexible results, and 
      programmers are encouraged to use the Finder's new "C" flag when 
      appropriate.
 
      Change 2: Reindexing Fire Order Change
      --------------------------------------
      The order in which cross-references fire can be crucial. We have 
      changed this order to correct what we perceive to be a flaw in the 
      algorithm. By its nature, this can affect the integrity of the 
      database. We believe the new order is the correct one, but if 
      there is code in VistA that relies on the old order this change 
      has the capability of introducing database corruption. We did not 
      make this change lightly. Not only do we believe the new fire 
      order is correct, but it is likely that code that relied upon the 
      old fire order was already introducing database corruption. We 
      have found no evidence yet of code that relied on the old fire 
      order, but in a system this complex we can never be sure.
 
      Most cross-reference are not sensitive to the order in which they 
      are fired. For example, a regular cross-reference simply creates 
      an index entry based on the current field value, and has no effect 
      on other field values or other indexes. However, a trigger does 
      affect other fields, and will affect other indexes if those fields 
      are cross-referenced. For example, if an entire record is being 
      reindexed, a cross-reference on the .01 field might trigger a new 
      value into field 1. If field 1 is cross-referenced before field 
      .01, field 1's indexes will use the old value instead of the new 
      one that the .01 trigger will put there.
 
      When you create a new entry, you enter the values for the .01 
      field before any other fields (generally speaking), so the cross-
      references on the .01 field fire first. However, before this 
      patch, when reindexing a record FileMan always saves the cross-
      references on the .01 field for last. Using our previous example 
      of the trigger on the .01, this means when adding an entry the 
      cross-references on field 1 use the new value triggered by the .01 
      but when reindexing field 1's cross-references fire first, using 
      the old value, and then cross-references on field .01 fire, 
      triggering the new value into field 1 but not affecting its cross-
      references.
 
      This effectively prevents you from writing code sensitive to fire 
      order that will work when reindexed. After a great deal of 
      consideration, we have decided that the fire order for the Set 
      Logic should always fire as if a new entry were being added; that 
      is, the .01 cross-references always fire first even when 
      reindexing. We decide the Kill Logic is firing in the correct 
      order already; that is, the kill logic for the .01 should fire 
      last so that FileMan-compatibility is preserved by keeping a B 
      cross-reference on any record for as long as possible.
 
      The Merge package uses extensive reindexing when merging two 
      records together, and requested this change. This change made the 
      package easier to code, and has produced no visible side effects 
      at the test sites.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Description:
============
 
This patch implements new VA FileMan functionality: the Import Tool.  
The Import Tool will move data from an ASCII host file into a VA FileMan 
file.  The uses and limitations of the Import Tool are described in the 
documentation. The location of the documentation is given below.
 
The Import Tool consists of a new option and a programmer API.  A new 
file is installed, too.
 
A.  Import Data option
 
The new option is the Import Data option found on the Other Options 
submenu (DIOTHER) on the VA FileMan menu.  This option invokes a 
ScreenMan form used to define the import.  In addition to moving data 
from a host file into a VA FileMan file, the Import Tool produces a 
report of the import activity.
 
Documentation of the Import Tool is located in a revised Chapter 18 of 
the VA FileMan User Manual.  Previously, that chapter documented the 
Data Export Tool.  Now, Chapter 18 documents both the Import and Export 
Tools.  The National Center for Documentation will be distributing this 
revised chapter.  Acrobat versions of both the change pages, and the 
User Manual updated with the change pages, are available at
 
 http://www.vista.domain.ext/softserv/infrastr.uct/fileman/docs/
 
The new chapter is also available in HTML format at:
 
 http://www.vista.domain.ext/softserv/infrastr.uct/fileman/docs/u2/
 (access the Import/Export Tools chapter)
 
B. FILE^DDMP API
 
The programmer API consists of a single call: FILE^DDMP.  Functionally, 
it is equivalent to the user option.  The API allows the programmer to 
specify the parameters of the data import.
 
Documentation in HTML format for the API can be found at:
 
      http://www.vista.domain.ext/softserv/infrastr.uct/fileman/docs/
      pm/ft_ddmpf.htm
 
C. Import Template file
 
A new file is added by this patch: the Import Template file (#.46).  The 
file's data is stored in an existing global -- root: ^DIST(.46.  No data 
for the file is contained in this patch.  
 
Routine Summary:

The following routines are included in this patch.  Checksums are 
CHECK^XTSUMBLD results.

The DDMP* routines contain the Import Tool.  DII1 is included to add the 
Import Data option to the Other menu when VA FileMan is accessed from 
Programmer mode.  DINIT6 assures that the Data Import option will not be 
removed from the Kernel menus if ^DINIT is rerun.  It is NOT necessary 
to rerun ^DINIT to implement this patch.
 
Installation Instructions: 
==========================
  
1.  Neither of the pre-existing routines in this patch are typically 
mapped. It is NOT recommended that any of the DDMP* routines be mapped.
 
2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This 
option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
 
3.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your 
system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.  
 
4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following 
options: 
 
           Print Transport Global 
           Compare Transport Global to Current System 
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
           Backup a Transport Global 
 
5.  Users may remain on the system when this patch is installed.  
TaskMan should remain running.
 
6.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following 
option: 
           Select Installation Option: Install Package(s) 
           Select INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*30 
                                ==========
 
Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
Protocols?' question. 
 
7.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to 
other CPUs?'. Then enter the names of your other Compute and Print 
server(s).
 
8.  KIDS will load the patch without further intervention.  During the
KIDS install, KIDS will produce the following messages:
 
        Data Dictionary for File #.403 not installed.
 
        Data Dictionary for File #.404 not installed.
 
These message do NOT indicate an error condition.  They are reporting that
new Data Dictionaries for the Form and Block files are not being installed
although data for those files is being updated.  This is correct.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
VA FileMan SQLI Interface (SQLI) 
 
This patch installs the foundation for building an interface between VA
FileMan's data dictionaries and a vendor's M-based SQL data dictionaries.
This patch will bring in a new global, ^DMSQ, and several new routines and
options in the DMSQ namespace.
 
The new files (in ^DMSQ) are in the 1.52 to 1.53 number range.  Each one
begins with SQLI, e.g. the SQLI_TABLE file.  None of the files includes
data.  After installing this patch, note that the DMSQ MENU will not be
attached to any other existing menu; it is stand-alone, to be assigned as
needed.
 
The installation of this patch is mandatory because the software includes
supported references (entry points and DD structures) that may be called
by application code.  So, even if you don't plan to implement
SQLI as a basis for a vendor SQL product, you still should install this
patch.  
 
The installation instructions for loading this patch are entirely
contained below.  You don't need to get the SQLI documentation for this
purpose.  (The SQLI documentation doesn't include installation
instructions for loading this patch.)
 
 
Documentation for Implementing SQLI
===================================
Implementing SQLI is optional.  See the VA FileMan SQLI Site Manual for
more information about populating the SQLI files and, furthermore,
incorporating vendor SQL products and building an SQL system.  This manual
is to be reproduced and distributed by the National Center for
Documetation (NCD).  This manual will also be available in Acrobat PDF
format from the SQLI home page:
 
         http://www.vista.domain.ext/softserv/infrastr.uct/sqli
 
The SQLI home page will be a source of current information, including case
studies of how sites have chosen to implement SQL access to their systems.
 
 
Test Sites 
==========
Two test sites have loaded this SQLI patch and have implemented a full SQL
system (with the additional vendor software that's needed).  These are the
VA medical facilities at San Francisco (VISN 21) and Brooklyn (VISN 3).  
 
Four additional test sites are in the process of establishing a system
that is based on SQLI:  VA medical facilities at Seattle (VISN 20),
Phoenix (VISN 18), West Haven (VISN 3), and Palo Alto (VISN 21).  
  
 
Supported References
====================
 
DATA DICTIONARIES  
All the files, fields, and cross-references included in this patch can be
referenced directly without integration agreements.  This enables vendors
to create mapping utilities using the SQLI structures.  Specifically,
these are the files in the 1.52 to 1.53 number range, all stored in ^DMSQ.
See the SQLI Vendor Manual on the SQLI home page for more specific
information.
 
CALLABLE ENTRY POINTS
The following routine entry points may be called in application code.
They are primarily designed for use in vendor mapping code.  See the SQLI
Site Manual and SQLI Vendor manual for more information.
 
Populating SQLI files (Projecting the Interface)
         ALLF^DMSQF - non-interactive call
         SETUP^DMSQ - interactive call (used in the DMSQ PROJECT option)
 
Populating the SQLI_KEY_WORD file (with the SQL vendor's keywords)
         KW^DMSQD - loads keywords from a specified global
 
Populate the SQLI_TABLE and SQLI_PRIMARY_KEY row counts (to accumulate
statistics that vendors may want to use to optimize queries)
         ALLS^DMSQS - all tables
         STATS^DMSQS - one table 
 
Naming algorithms to generate SQL-compatible names
         $$SQLI^DMSQU - general check
         $$SQLK^DMSQU - general check including keyword check
         $$FNB^DMSQU - specific check for table names
         $$CN^DMSQU - specific check for column names
 
DIRECT MODE UTILITIES (also available via the DMSQ MENU option)
These calls are for direct mode use only (issued interactively at the
programmer prompt).  They are not supported for use in application code.
See the SQLI Site Manual for more information.
 
         MAIN^DMSQE - lists files/fields that couldn't be projected
         RUNONE^DMSQ - re-run projection for one file (for testing only)

Installation Instructions: 
==========================
 
Before starting:  Place and protect ^DMSQ
 
This patch brings in a new global, ^DMSQ.  As usual with new globals,
place it before running the install (the default location of the install
will otherwise be used).  You can translate it for ease of access.
Journaling is unnecessary.
 
For global protection, a standard approach can be used, such as the
following:
 
     DSM for OpenVMS - System (RWD), World (RW), Group (RW), and User (RW)
     OpenM - Owner (RWD), Network (RWD), Group (N), World (N)
     MSM-DOS - System (RWD), World (RWD), Group (RWD), User (RWD)
 
NOTE: Users may remain on the system during this installation.  There's no
need to disable logons either.
   
1.  There's no need to disable mapping (these routines won't need to be
    mapped).
  
2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
    option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
   
3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your system.
    You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  
  
4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
    options: 
            Print Transport Global 
            Compare Transport Global to Current System 
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
            Backup a Transport Global 
  
(5.  Users don't need to logoff.  They may remain on the system while this
     patch is installed.) 
  
(6.  There isn't any need to place TaskMan in a WAIT state.) 
 
7.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
    option: 
 
            Install Package(s): 
            INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*38 
                          ==========
 
            Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu 
            Options, and Protocols?' 
  
8.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to other
    CPUs?'. Enter the names of your Compute and Print server(s).  
 
9.  MSM Sites - After the installation begins, you will be prompted to
    enter a DEVICE.  After the device has been entered, KIDS will pause.
    At this time, you need to go to each of the CPUs that were identified
    in the previous step and start a job that will allow them to receive
    the routines included in the patch.  On each CPU, do the following:
 
         a) &gt;D ^XUP     - to set up the programming environment 
             ======
         b) &gt;D ^XPDCPU  - to start the job that receives the routines 
             =========
         c) Select INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*38 
                                 ==========
 
This completes the installation instructions.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;44 SEQ #38</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1998-02-20 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 This patch makes a few minor bug fixes and contains some enhancements to
 ensure compliance with year 2000 issues.  The changes are as follows:
  
  
  
 DDMP2  Changed to call internal FileMan date formatting routines (DILIBF)
     rather than Kernel date formatting routines (XLFDT) to take
     advantage of changes made to DILIBF (described below).
  
  
 DIDT (%DT)  Two minor bugs were corrected.  
     One is that before, if %DT input variable contained "X", and if user
     entered a date like MMDDYY where the year was "00", the date was
     rejected. 
     The other is that one of the algorithms was incorrectly treating the
     year 2100 as a leap year.
  
     In addition, an enhancement was made that will change the current
     behavior. Currently, as documented, if a user enters only 2 digits of
     the year and if %DT is not set up by the developer to contain either
     an "F" (future) or "P" (past), then FileMan assumes the current
     century.  Thus in 1997, if a user enters 01/01/00, FileMan assumes
     01/01/1900.
  
     NEW BEHAVIOR for DIDT (%DT):
     note that this new behavior only applies when the user enters
     a 2-digit year, causing FileMan to guess the century.  Note
     also that the "F" and "P" flags will behave as they always have--this
     new behavior is only used when neither of those flags is set.
  
     If using the current century causes the date to be more than 80 years
     in the past, then FileMan will assume the next century.  Thus in 1997
     if a user enters a year of 0 through 16, FileMan will assume the
     years 2000 through 2016, because 1900 through 1916 are more than 80
     years in the past.
  
     If using the current century causes the date to be more than 20 years
     in the future, then FileMan will assume the previous century.  Thus
     in the year 2000, if the user enters 21 through 99, FileMan will
     assume the years 1921 through 1999, because 2021 through 2099 are
     more than 20 years in the future.
  
  
 DIDTC (%DTC)  Although all of the code properly handled dates up to 2100,
     the code was treating 2100 as a leap year.  This has been corrected.
     Also, online help for dates (HELP^%DTC) was changed to reflect the
     change in functionality described in ^%DT above.
  
  
 DIEH1  Online help for dates used by the DataBase Server calls (DT^DIEH1)
     was changed to reflect the change in functionality described in
     ^%DT above.  In support of this routine change is a change to entry
     #9110 in the DIALOG file.
  
  
 DILIBF  Old algorithms were treating the year 2100 as a leap year.  This
     has been corrected.
  
  
 DINVMSM  This routine contains operating system-specific code and is used
     by stand-alone FileMan sites only.  Routine SET was setting DT using
     an MSM-specific call that would not have worked properly in the year
     2000. This has been corrected.
  
  
 DIP12  In the PRINT option, if the user chose to print the sort criteria
     in the header of the report, and if any of the sort fields were
     dates, the date was previously printed with a 2-digit year. That is
     changed so that the date is now printed with a 4-digit year for
     clarity.
  
  
 DIQGU  Old algorithms were treating the year 2100 as a leap year.  This
     has been corrected.
  
  
  
 CHANGE TO ENTRY IN DIALOG FILE:  In support of new online help for dates
     to reflect the new behavior of ^%DT, entry number 9110 has been
     changed. This entry is called from routine DIEH1.
  
  
  
 NEW FILEMAN FUNCTIONS: NUMDATE4 and NUMYEAR4
     The new FileMan Functions NUMDATE4 and NUMYEAR4 have been added to
     the list of FileMan Functions that are available for use within
     FileMan.  They behave as follows:
  
   NUMDATE4
  
        Format:  NUMDATE4(datexp)
        Where:   datexp is an expression with a date/time value
        Use:     This function returns the date in datexp, in MM/DD/YYYY
                 format.
  
        Example:  NUMDATE4(DATE OF BIRTH)==&gt; 03/07/1949
  
  
   NUMYEAR4
  
        Format:   NUMYEAR4(datexp)
        Where:    datexp is an expression with a date/time value
        Use:      This function returns the 4 digit year in datexp as a  
                  number.
  
        Example:  NUMYEAR4(DATE OF BIRTH)==&gt; 1949

      To test if the transport has been corrupted, you can use the "Verify
Package Integrity" option.  This option is under Utilities under the KIDS
menu.  It will compare the checksums in the build with the current
checksums and list any that differ.  
 
 
 
 Installation Instructions: 
 ==========================
 
 NOTE the instructions that are different for your M implementation.  
 
      1.   NOTE: Users ARE NOT allowed to be on the system during the 
installation.  
 
   --- Pre Installation steps --- 
 
      2.   Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.
This option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  The environment
check routine DIENV will run automatically.
 
     DIENV is sent to prevent the inadvertent queuing of the installation
of this patch.
 
      3.   The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your 
system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  
 
      4.   On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
following options:
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
            Print Transport Global 
            Compare Transport Global to Current System 
            Backup a Transport Global 
 
   --- Actual Installation --- 
 
      5.   Users ARE NOT allowed to be on the system during the
installation. Inhibit users from login into the system.  %DT, %DTC, DILIBF
and DIP12 in particular are used heavily in VISTA applications.  The
consequences of installing this patch while users are on the system are
that users may get a 'source routine edited' error.
 
      6.   DO place TaskMan in a WAIT state.  
 
      7.   DSM Sites: The routines %DT, %DTC and DILIBF are usually mapped
on systems that allow mapping, so you will need to disable mapping for
these routines.
 
      8.   On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
following option:
            Install Package(s) 
 
            INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*44 
                          ==========
 
       Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
and Protocols?'
 
      9. DSM and MSM sites: After installing this patch, you need to move
the routines DIDT and DIDTC from your production account into your manager
account. Then, in the manager account, rename:
 
       DIDT to %DT 
       DIDTC to %DTC 
 
       Example: ZL DIDT ZS %DT 
 
     10. Open M sites: Rename: 
 
       DIDT to %DT 
       DIDTC to %DTC 
 
       Example: ZL DIDT ZS %DT 
 
     11.  DSM Sites: Rebuild your mapped set if necessary.  
 
     12.  DO remove TaskMan from a WAIT state.  
 
     13.  Enable users' login.

      it so you will probably not have to disable mapping.
 
      4.   Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.
      This option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
 
      5.   The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
  
      6.   On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
      following options:
  
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            Print Transport Global
            Compare Transport Global to Current System
            Backup a Transport Global

Description:
============
     This patch contains critical bug fixes requested by package 
     developers in need of the fixes for their own patches or 
     package releases.
 
     Compiled Routines
     -----------------
     1. Compiled Routines: problem uncompiling xrefs: DIPZ0 (for 
     Mike Hendry). Mr. Hendry reported that uncompiling cross-
     references didn't work if the file had whole file-cross-
     references on one of its subfiles. Reported in NOIS ISL-0897-
     51962.
 
     2. Compiled Routines: problem uncompiling input templates: 
     DIEZ (for Cindy Heuer). Ms. Heuer reported that uncompiled 
     input templates would recompile themselves when the 
     definitions of fields within those templates were changed. 
     Reported in FORUM msg # 23842872.
 
     Reader
     ------
     3. Reader: case sensitivity with codes: DIR1 (for Marcia
     Insley). Ms. Insley reported that the Reader converted the
     case of the user's input for the external form of the codes,
     but not for the internal. Reported in Forum msg # 23931868.
 
     4. Reader: list and range problems: DIR3 (for Gary Beuschel).
     Mr. Beuschel reported problem was that the Reader rejects
     lists that contain consecutive numbers out of order, such as
     50,49; I found that it also rejected a number followed by a
     range ending in that number, such as 50,40-50. Reported in
     ISC-SF msg #s 1190657, 1193613, and 1193773.
 
     5. Reader: problems with help for dates: DIR, DIR2 (for Gary 
     Beuschel). Mr. Beuschel reported that the help for dates is 
     scanty compared to what the %DT utility provides. It has been 
     brought in line with %DT's, and also made responsive to the 
     date parameters passed in the second ^-piece of DIR(0). 
     Reported by phone.
 
     6. Reader: DIR("PRE") parameter: DIR (for Gary Beuschel). Mr.
     Beuschel needed a programming hook to let him intercept the
     user's input before the Reader begins its data type
     validation. The new supported input parameter DIR("PRE") is a
     pre-validation transform that can either change X, in which
     case the Reader will proceed as though the new value is what
     the user entered, or can kill X, in which case the Reader will
     behave as though the user entered an illegal value. DIR("PRE")
     executes almost immediately after the READ takes place, just
     after DTOUT is set and before any other checking is done. The
     only inputs are X and DTOUT, and the only outputs are X and
     DTOUT. Reported in phone conversation with Mr. Beuschel.
 
     Lookup
     ------
     7. Classic Lookup: echo &amp; match lists: DIC1 (for Marcia 
     Insley, Tana Defa, and Melissa Hughes). Ms. Insley reported 
     during testing of CPRS that Puget Sound needed a change to how 
     DIC's E flag works. The E flag, which normally ensures a 
     user's response is echoed back, did not do so when the user 
     picked from a match list, a time when typos are therefore 
     difficult to notice but easy to make. This was changed to 
     make E work with match list selections. Reported in Forum msg 
     # 24573804.
 
     8. Finder: `IEN lookup problem: DICF1 (for Gary Beuschel). Mr. 
     Beuschel reported that the Finder's `IEN lookup is only 
     allowing IENs that are integers, disallowing such IENs as the 
     Postmaster's (.5). This was fixed. Reported in phone 
     conversation with Mr. Beuschel.
 
     9. Finder: illegal number error: DICF3 (for Bob Fuller). Mr. 
     Fuller reported an illegal number error caused by the Finder's 
     vulnerability to input that looks like an exponential. The 
     Finder has been bullet-proofed. Reported in NOIS # BRX-0397-
     12605.
 
     10. Finder &amp; Lister: tolerate empty indexes: DICF2, DICF3, 
     DICF5, DICL1 (for Rob Whelan, Deborah Gorman, Diane McCance, 
     and Gary Beuschel). Reported in NOIS #s BHH-0897-41483 and 
     CLE-0797-42276, and in phone conversations with Mr. Whelan and 
     Mr. Beuschel. 
 
     Enter &amp; Edit
     ------------
     11. Filer: prevent variable problem: DIEFU (for Joel Ivey). 
     Mr. Joel reported that during testing of Patient Merge, the 
     Filer did not adequately protect its own variables from deeply 
     recursive calls, playing havoc during Merge. This was fixed. 
     Reported in phone conversation with Mr. Ivey.
 
     12. Filer: allow deletion of top-level records: DIEF (for &amp; by 
     Danila Manapsal). Ms. Manapsal reported that the FileMan 
     Components need the ability to delete records through the 
     Filer. She corrected the Filer to allow this. Reported in 
     phone conversation with Ms. Manapsal.
 
     13. Updater: allow deletion of top-level records: DICA1 (for 
     Danila Manapsal). This change is also for the FileMan 
     Components.
 
     14. Updater: allow deletion of fields: DICA1 (for Michael 
     Ogi). Mr. Ogi reported that the Updater is needlessly blocking 
     the ability to delete fields, something the Filer (which it 
     calls) allows. This was changed. Reported in phone 
     conversation with Mr. Ogi.
 
     15. Updater: subentry problem: DICA1 (for Mike Kilmade). Mr. 
     Kilmade reported during development of PCMM that the Updater 
     was preventing deletion of subfile entries if the same FDA 
     added another subentry. This was fixed. Reported in Forum msg 
     # 19707244.
 
     16. Updater: process LAYGO Finding nodes before Adding nodes: 
     DICA2 (for Michael Ogi). Mr. Ogi reported during testing of 
     the Udpater that a bug prevented it from processing FDA nodes 
     in the order specified, which occasionally caused undefined 
     errors. The documented order was reestablished. Reported in 
     phone conversation with Mr. Ogi.
 
     17. Updater: return 0 nodes for LAYGO Finding nodes: DICA (for 
     Michael Ogi). Mr. Ogi reported during testing of the Updater 
     that it was not returning 0 nodes for LAYGO Finding nodes as 
     documented. The documented order was reestablished. Reported 
     in phone conversation with Mr. Ogi.
 
     18. Updater: stop errors with LAYGO Finding nodes: DICA1 (for 
     Alan Chan). Mr. Chan reported that under some circumstances 
     LAYGO Finding nodes were reporting errors instead of finding 
     existing entries. The errors were stopped, and LAYGO Finding 
     nodes now properly find existing entries. Reported in ISC-SF 
     msg # 1170164.
 
     19. Updater: stop multiple Updaters interference: DICA1 (for 
     Travis Torres). Mr. Torres reported that Updaters running 
     simultaneously in different processes on the same machine 
     could occasionally process each other's FDAs. The code was 
     changed to better segregate their data structures. Reported in 
     phone conversation with Mr. Torres.
 
     Output
     ------
     20. Sort: remove duplicates from prints: DIO0 (for David 
     Alexander, John Harvey, Nancy Nagle, Dan Petit, Daniel 
     Schramm, Ellen Zufall, Fil Beza). Many sites reported problems 
     with prints in which mnemonic cross-reference entries in the B 
     index were creating false positives in reports. Ms. Zufall and 
     Mr. Beza identified the problem as introduced by patch 
     DI*21*35, and Ms. Zufall fixed it. Reported in ISC-SF msg # 
     1198710, FORUM msg #s 25464901 and 25149562, and NOIS #s SFC-
     0198-60115, TOP-0198-40108, &amp; WBP-1297-21797.
 
     21. Transfer: improve performance: DITR, and DITR1 (for Dave 
     Bolduc). Mr. Bolduc reported slow performance on large 
     transfers, and identified a fix to the problem that was 
     gratefully accepted. Reported in NOIS # AIM-0797-N2065.
 
     Special thanks go to Dave Alexander, whose keen eye for bugs
     saved the rest of the VA a lot of grief with this patch.  :)

     calls) allows. This was changed. Reported in phone 
     conversation with Mr. Ogi.
 
     15. Updater: subentry problem: DICA1 (for Mike Kilmade). Mr. 
     Kilmade reported during development of PCMM that the Updater 
     was preventing deletion of subfile entries if the same FDA 
     added another subentry. This was fixed. Reported in Forum msg 
     # 19707244.
 
     16. Updater: process LAYGO Finding nodes before Adding nodes: 
     DICA2 (for Michael Ogi). Mr. Ogi reported during testing of 
     the Udpater that a bug prevented it from processing FDA nodes 
     in the order specified, which occasionally caused undefined 
     errors. The documented order was reestablished. Reported in 
     phone conversation with Mr. Ogi.
 
     17. Updater: return 0 nodes for LAYGO Finding nodes: DICA (for 
     Michael Ogi). Mr. Ogi reported during testing of the Updater 
     that it was not returning 0 nodes for LAYGO Finding nodes as 
     documented. The documented order was reestablished. Reported 
     in phone conversation with Mr. Ogi.
 
     18. Updater: stop errors with LAYGO Finding nodes: DICA1 (for 
     Alan Chan). Mr. Chan reported that under some circumstances 
     LAYGO Finding nodes were reporting errors instead of finding 
     existing entries. The errors were stopped, and LAYGO Finding 
     nodes now properly find existing entries. Reported in ISC-SF 
     msg # 1170164.
 
     19. Updater: stop multiple Updaters interference: DICA1 (for 
     Travis Torres). Mr. Torres reported that Updaters running 
     simultaneously in different processes on the same machine 
     could occasionally process each other's FDAs. The code was 
     changed to better segregate their data structures. Reported in 
     phone conversation with Mr. Torres.
 
     Output
     ------
     20. Sort: remove duplicates from prints: DIO0 (for David 
     Alexander, John Harvey, Nancy Nagle, Dan Petit, Daniel 
     Schramm, Ellen Zufall, Fil Beza). Many sites reported problems 
     with prints in which mnemonic cross-reference entries in the B 
     index were creating false positives in reports. Ms. Zufall and 
     Mr. Beza identified the problem as introduced by patch 
     DI*21*35, and Ms. Zufall fixed it. Reported in ISC-SF msg # 
     1198710, FORUM msg #s 25464901 and 25149562, and NOIS #s SFC-
     0198-60115, TOP-0198-40108, &amp; WBP-1297-21797.
 
     21. Transfer: improve performance: DITR, and DITR1 (for Dave 
     Bolduc). Mr. Bolduc reported slow performance on large 
     transfers, and identified a fix to the problem that was 
     gratefully accepted. Reported in NOIS # AIM-0797-N2065.
 
     Special thanks go to Dave Alexander, whose keen eye for bugs
     saved the rest of the VA a lot of grief with this patch.  :)

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Description:
===========
This patch corrects some problems with record and file deletion.
 
DIK,DIK1
--------
The patch to these two routines backs out a change made by Patch DI*21*42.
Prior to patch 42, when a record is deleted with ^DIK, the kill logic on
the .01 field of the record fired last, after the kill logic on other
fields. Patch 42 changed it so that the kill logic on the .01 field fired
first.
 
This caused a problem for IFCAP. Cross references on File #421 are defined
in such a way that when a record is deleted, if the kill logic for the .01
field is fired before the kill logic on other fields, an erroneous "AL"
cross reference remains on the file. Erroneous "AL" cross references can
cause subsequent errors when attempts are made to release transactions.
 
This patch restores the pre-Patch 42 behavior, so that the kill logic on
the .01 field fires last when a record is deleted.

DIK,DIK1
--------
When many fields in a file are being audited, and ^DIK is used to delete
entries in file, or the entry points to ^DIK are used to reindex entries,
the DIAU array could get very large and cause an allocation error when the
local symbol table fills up.

DIU0
----
If EN^DIU2 is used to delete a file that has a global root of
^DIC(FileNumber), and the DIU input variable contains the global root
without a trailing comma (e.g., "^DIC(81.2" ), EN^DIU2 proceeded to delete
File #1. This patch makes EN^DIU2 check that the global root passed in DIU
ends in either a comma or a close parenthesis.

Description:
============
If a programmer sets ^UTILITY($J,"W") but there are no descendants, DIWW
would go into a self-contained loop. The FileMan Programmer Manual states
on page 138, when talking about DIWP, that the programmer should Kill
^UTILITY($J,"W") prior to calling DIWP and DIWW. However, it was
recognized that the Kill may not always take place and, therefore, there
was a possibility of an internal loop.  A check is now made that if
^UTILITY($J,"W") exists and there are no descendants, DIWW Quits.

When a user is using FileMan's Search option and uses a Condition of
MATCHES and enters an invalid 'M' pattern match the report will error out.
For example:
 
  -A- SEARCH FOR MYFILE FIELD: NUMBER CODE
  -A- CONDITION: MATCHES
  -A- MATCHES: 300.4
 
With the result that invalide 'M' pattern matching code was generated,
causing a &lt;syntax&gt; error.  The invalid code looks like the following
example:
 
I $S($D(^DIZ(640999,D0,1)):$P(^(1),U,1),1:"")?300.4
 
This patch prevents the user from entering an invalid pattern matching
code.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch fixes a bug and contains information and examples on how to
call an 'M' routine from a print template or the FLDS input variable to
EN1^DIP.
 
Bug fixed:
---------
If the FLDS input variable to EN1^DIP contains a call to an 'M' routine,
the resulting report may differ depending on whether or not the user's
DUZ(0) contains an at-sign (@).
 
In the following example, a user whose DUZ(0)'["@" would see the SSN
printed twice, whereas the user whose DUZ(0)["@" would see the Patient's
SSN printed once.
 
    S FLDS=".01;C1;L22;""PATIENT"",D SSN^MYPROG;C24;R4;""SSN"""
 
    Routine called:
      MYPROG   ;SFCIOFO/S0 TEST ROUTINE ; 21 Aug 98  2:06 PM

               W X
               Q
 
Information:
-----------
If you use the FLDS input variable to EN1^DIP or a print template to call
an 'M' routine to evaluate and print a value, you must WRITE the value you
want printed. Examples 1 and 2 below illustrate how this is done.
 
Example #1: The routine is called from a Print Template
=======================================================
 
Print Template:

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
                         Notice:
    ** This patch should be installed with NO users online ** 
 
Background: PreKIDS - when packages were installed, a set of routines were
created by the developer(s) to export Data Dictionary changes.
  
These were in the form of &lt;nmsp&gt;INIT.  From the programmer prompt you 
would D ^&lt;nmsp&gt;INIT, i.e. D ^ABCINIT, and the package would be installed 
onto your system. The problem was that if a developer changed the name of 
a file or subfile the INIT would add another 'NM' node, instead of 
removing the old 'NM' node and then adding the new node.  
 
This patch corrects these duplicate "NM" nodes located in: 
^DD(&lt;file/subfile#&gt;,0,"NM",&lt;file name&gt;)="" 
using the same logic that FileMan Option: 
Check/Fix DD Structure [DI DDUCHK] uses when Fix is specified.  
 
The routine DIPR50 loops through all of the DHCP files, looking for 
duplicate "NM" nodes and corrects any duplicates that are found.  The
following is a sample dialog when a duplicate 'NM' node is encountered:
 
File/Subfile: 662001 has duplicate 'NM' nodes.
     Duplicate 'NM' node(s) were deleted and fixed.
        'NM' node will be set to: ZZTAMI TEST

Installation Instructions: 
==========================
 
        1.  There is no routine mapping involved.  
 
        2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.  
This option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
 
        3.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your 
system.  You now need to use KIDS to finish the preperation for 
installation.  
 
        4.  Optionally on the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation menu', 
use the following options: 
                Print Transport Global 
                Compare Transport Global to Current System 
                Verify Checksums in Transport Global.  
 
     5.  Inhibit users' login into the system.  The consequence of having 
users on the system while installing this patch are that users editing 
records will get an Undefined error, the edits will be lost and records 
may be left in an inconsistent state.  Note that most of these 
DD's are heavily used in DHCP applications.  
  
     6.  AXP Sites - Place Taskman in a WAIT State.  
         MSM Sites - STOP Taskman.  
  
     7.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
following option: 
            Select Installation Option: Install Package(s) 
            Select INSTALL NAME: DI*21.0*50 
                                 ==========
  
            Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu 
Options, and Protocols? 
Note to MSM Sites - Answer NO to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to 
other CPUs?'.  
 
        8.  Restart TaskMan, any background filers, and reenable user 
logons.  
 
        9. You may now delete DIPR50.

Bug Fixes
=========
1. If a computed field expression was too complex for DICOMP to interpret,
an error would result. With this patch, if an expression that is too
complex is entered, a beep and '??' will be displayed.
 
2. If a backward extended pointer was used, and the name of the file
contained a '/', the expression was rejected with a beep and '??'.
For example:
 
Select OPTION: PRINT FILE ENTRIES  
 
OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: PATIENT// 
SORT BY: NAME// RAD/NUC MED PATIENT:
   By 'RAD', do you mean the RAD/NUC MED PATIENT File,
       pointing via its 'NAME' Field? Yes//   (Yes)??
SORT BY: NAME// 
 
This problem is fixed with this patch.
 
3. When 2 separate fields are defined as Pointer to a File and they point
to the same file and they are printed one after each other, an error would
occur.  For example:
 
Select OPTION: PRINT FILE ENTRIES
OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: S0 TEST #1// 
SORT BY: NAME// 
START WITH NAME: FIRST// 
FIRST PRINT FIELD: PT200A:
  THEN PRINT NEW PERSON FIELD: SSN    
  THEN PRINT NEW PERSON FIELD: 
THEN PRINT FIELD: PT200B:
  THEN PRINT NEW PERSON FIELD: SSN    
  THEN PRINT NEW PERSON FIELD: 
THEN PRINT FIELD:

 Prior to this change, VAL^DIE and the DBS calls that use it, like
 UPDATE^DIE and FILE^DIE, were returning Dialog Error message #701 when an
 external form of a set of codes field was passed in, but the external
 code was ambiguous.
   
 For example, if the codes are:
 
     &amp;       AND
     &amp;'      AND NOT
     !       OR
     !'      OR NOT
   
 and the value 'AND' is passed to the Updater with "E" flag, the message:
   
     The value 'AND' for field xxxxx in file xxxxx is not valid.
   
 With this change, if the external code is ambiguous but exact, the value
 is accepted.  Also, display a 4-digit year in the prompt for a Date read,
 when an earliest and latest date are specified or in the error message
 when the date entered is out of the specified range.

Bug Fix
=======
This patch fixes the following problem: 
  When a user answered the Alert prompt for what action to take, they
could inadvertenly enter a control character (i.e. BackSpace, Tab) which
would cause a looping within the DIR* routines.  This patch corrects that
problem.

** It is HIGHLY recommended that ALL Users and VISTA Background jobs to be
   STOPPED.  Failure to do so may result in a 'source routine edited'
   error, the edits will be lost and records may be left in an
   inconsistent state. **
 
     1.  AXP sites: Review your mapped routine set.  If any of the
routine(s) listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should
be removed from the mapped set at this time.
 
     2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This 
option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
 
The environment check routine DIENVWRN will run automatically.  Routine
DIENVWRN is sent in order to prevent the inadvertent queueing during the
installation of this patch.
 
     3.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your
system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
 
     4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
following options:
            Print Transport Global 
            Compare Transport Global to Current System 
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
            Backup a Transport Global
 
     5.  Inhibit users' login into the system.  The consequence of having
users on the system while installing this patch are that users editing
records will get a 'source routine edited' error, the edits will be lost
and records may be left in an inconsistent state.  Note that most of these
routines are heavily used in DHCP applications.

File #1 has a multiple called APPLICATION GROUP (Field #10) and on this
multiple there is a whole file cross reference - "AC".  It was
recently discovered that at some time in a past version that this cross
reference was not being properly killed off.  This patch will go through
this cross reference and remove any of the erroneous entries.  The routine
will also check the APPLICATION GROUP multiple's "B" cross reference and
remove any of the erroneous entries.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
After V22 of VA FileMan was released to National VistA Support (NVS) for
field distribution several bugs were discovered at the test sites that
could affect various packages.  The following is list of the routine(s)
and the problem that was corrected: 
 
Routine: DICATTD
Bug: When using the option Modify File Attributes AND used the
Screen-Mode version AND were adding a Free Text multiple, the 2nd piece of
the 0 node of the DD would be corrupted.
 
Routine: DICOMPV 
Bug: It was discovered that when using a Backward Extended Pointer and the
file that was being jumped to had a DINUMed .01 field back to the
originating file, a jump was not being allowed.  
 
Routine: DIC3
Bug: Input variable DIC("S") to the ^DIC routine altered local variable Y.
FileMan was not protecting Y and expected it to contain the record number
just looked-up, so the wrong value was displayed for the .01 field when
entries were presented to the end-user.
 
Routines: DIC1, DIC11
Bug: When the internal value of a date, pointer or variable pointer is
passed as a default lookup value in input variable DIC("B") to the ^DIC
routine, it should be displayed to the end-user in external format.  This
worked in V21 but didn't in V22.
 
Routine: DIE
Bug: After a call to ^DIE with DR="[template name]", a ^TMP("DIE",number)
node was not being killed.
 
Routine: DIEZ
Bug: An undefined X variable error could occur during a KIDS installation,
when KIDS called FileMan to uncompile an input template.
 
Routines: DICA, DICA1
Bug: If an UPDATE^DIE call is made from within another UPDATE^DIE call
(for example, when the Updater executes a cross-reference that makes
another Updater call), the call could fail and Dialog file error messages
generated. Also the variable D was leaking out of UPDATE^DIE.
 
Routine: DIEFW
Bug: An undefined DIEFLOCK could occur if the Filer was called with the
"K" flag to do locking, and within that Filer call, a call was made to
WP^DIE (from within a cross-reference, for example) without the "K" flag.
 
Routines: DIFROMSX, DIFROMXY
Change: Before, if a partial DD was sent with KIDS and the file had KEYs,
all of the field definitions for the KEY fields had to be sent.  We
decided that wasn't necessary, so after this patch, the field definition
for a key field must be sent only if the key is compound and other
field(s) in the key are being sent.
 
Routines: DIK1, DIKZ1
Bug: The ^DIK entry points did not have time-outs on the Lock commands
they issued.
 
Routine: DIR1
Bug: MAS patch DG*5.3*149 brought new code into routine DGREG.  The old
code directly executed the input transform from subfile 2.101, field .01
to check the validity of a value entered by the user (in X). The new code
instead calls CHK^DIE (which also executes the input transform) to check
the validity of the value. The input transform code for this field sets
the variable DINUM.  The MAS code at REG+2^DGREG then uses DINUM.  In
version 22, FileMan NEWs DINUM in the CHK^DIE call before executing the
input transform, because DINUM is not a documented output variable, and
because it is a dangerous variable to leave around.  MAS does not have
time to patch their code before the planned release of version 22, so
FileMan will temporarily 'leak' DINUM in order to avoid a hard error.
After MAS patches their code, FileMan will issue another patch to restore
the NEW DINUM.
 
Routines: DIE1, DIEF, DIKC
Bug: If there is an X1 array element corresponding to the .01 field in the
new-style Index logic or condition, make sure it is set to null if the
record is being added.
 
Routines: DINIT2A1, DINIT2A2, DINIT2A3, DINIT2A4
Bug: These DINIT routines fix a typo on the description of the following
field in the Cross-Reference Values multiple of the Index file (#.11):
 
   11.1  Cross-Reference Values (Multiple-.114)
         4.5  Computed Code
  
         was: "Answer with M code that set X..."
   should be: "Answer with M code that sets X..."
 
The DINIT routines also add information about the X1 and X2 arrays to the
descriptions of the following fields in the Index file (#.11):
  
   1.1  Set Logic
   1.4  Set Condition Code
   2.1  Kill Logic
   2.4  Kill Condition Code
  
 For each of the above fields, the following paragraph was appended to the
 description:
 
   When fields that make up a cross-reference are edited and the kill and
   set logic are executed, the X1(order#) array contains the old field
   values, and the X2(order#) array contains the new field values. If a
   record is being added, and there is an X1(order#) array element that
   corresponds to the .01 field, it is set to null. When a record is
   deleted, all X2(order#) array elements are null.
 
Since the KIDS build for this patch brings in these fields automatically,
there is no need to rerun DINIT after installing this patch.

Routine: DIC11
--------------
In version 21 of FileMan, if lookup value is accent grave followed by a
number, FileMan first looks on the current file for a matching IEN.  If
none is found, but we can add records to the file, and if the .01 field is
a pointer or variable pointer, FileMan looks on the pointed-to file for a
matching IEN. This did not work for variable pointers in version 22
because it was felt that the user had no control over which of the
pointed-to files might be used for the match.  However, on the NOIS, the
developers had used DIC("V") to limit the lookup to only one of the
pointed-to files.  This patch makes the lookup work on variable pointers
as well as pointers.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch introduces two new APIs in VA FileMan, DELIX^DDMOD and
DELIXN^DDMOD. DELIX^DDMOD can be used to delete a Traditional
Cross-Reference definition from the data dictionary. DELIXN^DDMOD can be
used to delete a New-Style Index definition from the Index file (#.11).
Optionally, depending on the type of cross-reference deleted, the APIs
will also delete the data in the index or execute the kill logic for all
entries in the file. Compiled input templates that contain the field on
which the cross-reference is defined are recompiled. If cross-references
on the file are compiled, they are also recompiled.

  DELIX^DDMOD(FILE,FIELD,CROSS_REF,FLAGS,OUTPUT_ROOT,MSG_ROOT)
  
  Input Parameters
  ----------------
  FILE          (Required) File or subfile number.
                  
  FIELD         (Required) Field number.
                  
  CROSS_REF     (Required) Cross-reference number. Traditional
                cross-references are defined in the data dictionary
                under ^DD(file#,field#,1,cross reference number).
                  
  FLAGS         (Optional) Flags to control processing. The possible
                values are:
                  
                  K     For Regular, KWIC, Mnemonic, and Soundex-type
                        cross-references, delete the data in the index.
                        For MUMPS and Trigger-type cross-references,
                        execute the kill logic of the cross-reference for
                        all entries in the file. For Bulletin-type
                        cross-references, the "K" flag is ignored; the
                        kill logic for Bulletin-type cross-references is
                        never executed by this procedure.
                  
                  W     Write messages to the current device as the index
                        is deleted and cross-references and input
                        templates are recompiled.
                  
  OUTPUT_ROOT   (Optional) The name of the array that should receive
                information about input templates and cross-references
                that may have been recompiled and a flag to indicate that
                the deletion was audited in the DD Audit file (#.6). See
                Output below. This must be a closed root, either local or
                global.
                  
  MSG_ROOT      (Optional) The name of the array that should receive any
                error messages. This must be a closed root, either local
                or global. If not passed, errors are returned descendent
                from ^TMP("DIERR",$J).
  
  Output
  ------
  OUTPUT_ROOT   See OUTPUT_ROOT under Input Parameters.
                  
                If the field on which the deleted cross-reference was
                defined is used in any compiled input templates, those
                input templates are recompiled. Information about the
                recompiled input templates is stored descendant from
                OUTPUT_ROOT("DIEZ"):
                  
                  OUTPUT_ROOT("DIEZ",input template #) = 
                    input template name ^ file # ^ compiled routine name
                
                If cross-references for the file are compiled, they are
                recompiled, and the compiled routine name is stored in
                OUTPUT_ROOT("DIKZ"):
                
                  OUTPUT_ROOT("DIKZ") = compiled routine name
                
                If the data dictionary for the file is audited, an entry
                is made in the DD Audit file (#.6) and
                OUTPUT_ROOT("DDAUD") is set to 1:
                
                  OUTPUT_ROOT("DDAUD") = 1
  
  Example
  -------
  1.  In this example, regular cross-reference #4 (the "C" index), defined
      on field #12 in file #16200, is deleted. The "K" flag indicates that
      the entire ^DIZ(16200,"C") index is removed from the file.
  
        &gt;D DELIX^DDMOD(16200,12,4,"K","MYOUT")
  
        &gt;ZW MYOUT
  
        MYOUT("DDAUD")=1
        MYOUT("DIEZ",100)=ZZTEST EDIT^16200^ZZIT
        MYOUT("DIKZ")=ZZCR
  
      The MYOUT output array indicates that the deletion was recorded in
      the DD Audit file (#.6).  Field #12 is included in the compiled
      input template ZZTEST EDIT (#100), which is compiled into the ZZIT
      namespaced routines. Cross-references on file #16200 are compiled
      under the ZZCR namespace.
  
  2.  In this example, the whole-file regular cross-reference #7 (the "N"
      index), defined on field #15 within subfile #16200.075, is deleted.
      The "K" flag indicates that the entire ^DIZ(16200,"N") index should
      be removed, and the "W" flag indicates that messages should be
      printed to the current device.

  DELIXN^DDMOD: New-Style Index Deleter
  =====================================
  This procedure deletes a New-Style Index definition from the Index file.
  Optionally, it deletes the data in the index or executes the kill logic
  for all entries in the file. Compiled input templates that contain one
  or more of the fields defined in the index are recompiled. If
  cross-references on the file are compiled, they are recompiled.
  
  Format
  ------
  DELIXN^DDMOD(FILE,INDEX,FLAGS,OUTPUT_ROOT,MSG_ROOT)
  
  Input Parameters
  ----------------
  FILE          (Required) File or subfile number. For whole-file indexes,
                this is the number of the file at the upper level where
                the data in the index resides.
  
  INDEX         (Required) Index name.
                
  FLAGS         (Optional)
                Flags to control processing. The possible values are:
                
                  K     For Regular indexes, delete the data in the index.
                        For MUMPS indexes, execute the kill logic for all
                        entries in the file.
                
                  W     Write messages to the current device as the index
                        is deleted and cross-references and input
                        templates are recompiled.
                        
  OUTPUT_ROOT   (Optional) The name of the array that should receive
                information about input templates and cross-references
                that may have been recompiled. See Output below. This must
                be a closed root, either local or global.
                
  MSG_ROOT      (Optional) The name of the array that should receive any
                error messages. This must be a closed root, either local
                or global. If not passed, errors are returned descendent
                from ^TMP("DIERR",$J).
  
  Output
  ------
  OUTPUT_ROOT   See OUTPUT_ROOT under Input Parameters. If a field used in
                the index is used in any compiled input templates, those
                input templates are recompiled. Information about the
                recompiled input templates is stored descendant from
                OUTPUT_ROOT("DIEZ"):
                
                  OUTPUT_ROOT("DIEZ",input template #) =
                    input template name ^ file # ^ compiled routine name
                
                If cross-references for the file are compiled, they are
                recompiled, and the compiled routine name is stored in
                OUTPUT_ROOT("DIKZ"):
                
                  OUTPUT_ROOT("DIKZ") = compiled routine name
  
  Example
  -------
  1.  In this example, the new-style "G" index defined on file #16200 is
      deleted. The "K" flag indicates that the entire ^DIZ(16200,"G")
      index should be removed from the file.
  
        &gt;D DELIXN^DDMOD(16200,"G","K","MYOUT")
  
        &gt;ZW MYOUT
        MYOUT("DIEZ",94)=ZZ TEST^16200^ZZIT
        MYOUT("DIEZ",100)=ZZ TEST A^16200^ZZITA
        MYOUT("DIKZ")=ZZCR
  
      The MYOUT output array indicates that a field or fields defined in
      the deleted index are used in the compiled input templates ZZ TEST
      (#94) and ZZ TEST 2 (#100). Those two input templates were
      recompiled. Cross-references on file #16200 were also recompiled
      under the ZZCR namespace.
  
  2.  In this example, the whole-file regular index (the "J" index) is
      deleted. The fields in the index come from fields in a multiple,
      subfile #16200.075, but the whole-file index resides at the
      top-level file #16200. The "K" flag indicates that the entire
      ^DIZ(16200,"J") index should be removed, and the "W" flag indicates
      that messages should be printed to the current device.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch fixes some bugs, and contains an enhancement to address a Y2K
issue.
 
Routine: DIDT (%DT), DIDTC (%DTC)
---------------------------------
Bug fixes:
---------
1. Input such as such as "07/00", "JUL 00", and "00 JUL", where the
two-digit year is "00", was rejected even if inexact dates are allowed.
With this patch, if %%DT'["X" the above inputs are interpreted as July
2000.
 
2. Input such as "0700", where the input is exactly 4 numerics with "00"
as the last to digits, was interpreted as July of the current year (if the
"P" and "F" flags weren't used). With this patch, if %DT'["X", "0700" is
interpreted as July 2000; if %DT["X", it is rejected.
 
3. Input such as "070", where the input is exactly 3 numerics, and the
first two numbers are a valid month and the third number is a 0, was
interpreted as July of the current year (if the "P" and "F" flags weren't
used). With this patch, "070" is rejected.
 
Enhancement:
-----------
Introduce a new "M" flag for %DT. This flag allows input such as "0701",
"07/01", "JUL 01", "01 JUL" to be interpreted as July 2001, instead of
July 1st.
 
  M      Only Month and year input is allowed (example 1). If only a month
         and two digits are entered, interpret the two digits as a year
         instead of a day (example 2).
         
         If the M flag is used with the X flag, a month must be specified;
         otherwise, the input can be just a year (example 3).

Installation Instructions: 
==========================
 ***********************************************************************
 *  It is HIGHLY recommended that ALL Users and VISTA Background jobs  *
 *  be STOPPED. Failure to do so may result in a 'source routine       *
 *  edited' error. Edits will be lost and records may be left in an    *

 ***********************************************************************
 
     1.  AXP sites: Review your mapped routine set. If any of the
routine(s) listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, the should be
removed from the mapped set at this time.
 
     2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
 
         The Environment Check Routine DIENVWRN will run automatically.
Routine DIENVWRN is sent in order to prevent the inadvertent queuing
during the installation of this patch.
 
     3.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your
system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
 
     4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
following options: 
 
            Print Transport Global
            Compare Transport Global to Current System
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            Backup a Transport Global
 
     5.  Inhibit users from login into the system.  %DT and %DTC are used
heavily in VISTA applications. The consequences of installing this patch
while users are on the system are that users may get a 'source routine
edited' error.
 
     6.  AXP Sites - Place TaskMan in a WAIT State.
         OpenM/Cache Sites - STOP TaskMan.   
 
     7.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the

     8.  After installing this patch, you need to move the routines DIDT
and DIDTC from your production account into your manager account. Then, in
the manager account, rename:
 
            DIDT to %DT 
            DIDTC to %DTC 
 
            Example: ZL DIDT ZS %DT 
 
     9.  AXP Sites - After the patch has been installed, rebuild your map
set, if necessary.
 
    10.  AXP Sites - Remove TaskMan from WAIT State.
         OpenM/Cache Sites - Restart TaskMan.
 
    11.  Enable users' login.

Routines: DID1, DID2
--------------------
Bug: When running the List File Attributes option on a file that has
extensive M code for Cross References, Input Transforms and the like, if
the Right Margin was small enough, it was possible to go into an endless
loop. This was noticed when trying to List File Attributes for file #63
and sending the output to the Browser with a right margin less than 132.
The result was a "disk full" error.
(NOIS: BRX-1295-10591)
 
Routine: DID1
-------------
Bug: In a Standard DD Listing, the Descriptions of cross-references
weren't formatted correctly within the margins of the report.
(NOIS: ISW-1198-21324)
 
Routines: DIV, DIVR
-------------------
Bug: If the UTILITY FUNCTIONS/VERIFY FIELDS option is used, the generated
report could scroll off the screen. This patch makes the option prompt for
device, and if the report is printed to the screen, makes it issue the
"Enter RETURN to continue or '^' to exit:" prompt at the end of each page.
 
Routines: DIVR, DIVR1
---------------------
Bug: When the UTILITY FUNCTIONS/VERIFY FIELDS option is used, and if a
required or key field equals only one or more spaces, the message
"Missing" would be printed. This patch changes the message to "Equals only

Bug: The prompt after option 4, Modify File Attributes, had a typo:
the word "USER" should be "USE":

Routines: DIPR7, DINIT11B
-------------------------
Bug: Change field 20 DEVELOPER in file 1 (FILE) so that LAYGO is not
allowed to file 200 (NEW PERSON file).  This should have never been
allowed and was an oversite.  DIPR7 is a pre-init routine that changes the
second piece of the field from 200P to 200P'.  DINIT11B is the routine
that is the part of the initialization of FileMan that brings in field 20.
 
 **NOTE** You may safely delete routine DIPR7 after installing this patch.

This patch repairs allocation errors when doing a call to the FileMan
lookup routine ^DIC.
 
 
Routine: DIC3
=============
Repairs allocation error at C4+2^DICUIX2. This happened because one of the
Mailman files had some invalid nodes that looked like cross-references.
Each node had a subscript that contained an "R" followed by a number. This
error would only happen on a real file if it had several thousand
individual cross-references (which would not be likely to happen). Nois:
KAN-0999-40493.
 
Routines: DICM0,DICM3
=====================
Repairs allocation error at S+14^DIC3. This would only happen when a
cross-reference was on a pointer or variable pointer field, there were
many (over 1000) entries that pointed to an entry whose .01 field matched
the value being looked-up, but a screen made it so that most of the
entries with the pointer were not selected. Noises: HIN-0999-42903,
ATG-0999-32715, SLC-0999-52640, DAY-0899-41847.

Routine: ^DIK1
--------------
Bug: Suppose ^DIK is used to delete a record with an internal entry number
(ien) of X in a file, X equals what's in the 3rd piece of the header node
of the file, and there is no record in the file with an ien of X-1. If
either of the following is true:
 
  - X is the last ien used in the file, and the difference between X and
    the ien of the preceding record is large; or
 
  - the difference between X and the ien of the next record is large
 
^DIK could go into an extremely time-consuming loop as it attempts to find
the ien of the last (or next) record in the file.
 
For example, file 16010 has the following header node and entries:
 
  ^DIZ(16010,0) = TEST^16010^xxx^3
                              ^------- 3rd piece of header node
  ^DIZ(16010,1,0) = FIRST
  ^DIZ(16010,10,0) = SECOND
  ^DIZ(16010,12345678901234,0) = THIRD
 
If you use ^DIK to delete entry #10 (and xxx = 10) or entry
#12345678901234 (and xxx = 12345678901234), ^DIK could go into a
time-consuming loop.

This patch fixed a few minor bugs and adds some enhancements to correct
deficiencies in the FileMan Lookup routines ^DIC*, Finder routines ^DICF*,
and Editing routines ^DIE*.
 
***** Y2K Waiver Exemption ID#:  Y2KWE0015 *****
 
Routines: DIC,DIC1,DICM,DICM0,DICM3
-----------------------------------
"^^" OUT.  Users will be allowed to enter a double up-arrow ^^ at a prompt
in the ^DIC lookup.  This will get them clear out of the lookup.
Previously, users wre able to enter a single up-arrow ^ but this only took
them out of the search through the current index.  If there were many
indexes being searched, the search could continue for a long time with no
way to exit. NOIS: NTH-0399-71535.
 
Routines: DDSU,DICQ,DICQ1,DICLIX
--------------------------------
Control number of entries displayed in "?" help.  Developers needed a way
to control question mark help in the ^DIC lookup so that the output didn't
scroll off the screen.  New input variable
DIC("?N",file#)=number_of_entries_to_display can be set to the number of
entries to be displayed at any one time in question mark help.  NOIS:
ISW-0199-21924.
 
Routines: DIC4,DICF4,DICM0,DICM3,DICN,DICQ1,DIE,DIE1,DIE17,DIE3,DIED,DIEZ1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Control lookup to pointed-to files.  During lookups on files with
either indexed pointer or variable pointer fields, FileMan does a lookup
on the pointed-to file, lookup for a match to the lookup value entered by
the user. FileMan always looked on either the "B" index only on the
pointed-to file (if DIC(0) did not contain "M"), or else on all lookup
indexes.  A new input array to the interactive lookup ^DIC or to the
silent data base server lookup routine FIND^DIC, allows the developer to
specify what indexes are to be used during lookup on a pointed-to file.
The array for ^DIC looks like
  DIC("PTRIX",from_file#,pointer_field#,to_file#)=list_of_indexes.
For the Finder, it looks like
  DINDEX(("PTRIX",from_file#,pointer_field#,to_file#)=list_of_indexes
For ^DIE, it looks like:
  DIE("PTRIX",from_file#,pointer_field#,to_file#)=list_of_indexes
 
Routines: DIC,DIC0,DIC1,DIC2,DIC3,DIC5,DICFIX,DICM,DICM0,DICM3 
--------------------------------------------------------------
ConTinue looking through all indexes.  ^DIC lookup does an initial pass
through the list of indexes, looking for matches to the lookup value as it
was entered by the user.  If any are found, they are presented to the
user, and whether or not any are accepted, FileMan gets out.  Only if it
finds no matches, does it attempt transforms on the lookup, such as
converting pointers, variable pointers, sets or dates to their internal
format, or converting the lookup value to upper case.  This can cause the
lookup to miss some of the matching values.  A new flag "T" can be put
into DIC(0) that will cause FileMan to keep looking until it has either
tried everything, or until the user selects an entry.  In addition, the
transforms for pointers, variable pointers, dates or sets are done during
the first pass, so indexes are truly searched in the order requested by
the user.  NOIS: ATG-0397-30298, BRX-0197-11979, MAD-0394-40135.
 
Routines: DICF2,DICF3,DICF4,DICF5 
---------------------------------
"O" flag in Finder call.  It was discovered here that the "O" flag in the
finder didn't work the same in version 22 as it did in version 21.  With
this patch, the behavior is the same as version 21, in that an entire pass
through all indexes is made to find any exact matches, before doing a
second pass to find partial matches. NOIS: PAL-1099-60334, LAH-1099-60966
 
Routine: DICN1
-------------- 
'Before' values in SET/KILL logic.  It was discovered here that when a new
entry was added using the classic interactive lookup ^DIC, the X1 and X2
array entries for the "BEFORE" values for use in the SET and KILL logic of
new style indexes were not always reliable.  This corrects that bug.
 
Routine: DICM
-------------
'Missing Right Parenthesis' error in Print.  When doing a print, at the
PRINT FIELD prompt, if a field name greater than 30 characters long was
entered, along with a header qualifier in mixed case, a 'missing right
parenthesis' error occurred.  This error was actually happening during the
lookup for field name on the DD.  NOIS: BRX-0699-11412.
 
Routine: DICM2
--------------
Variable pointer prefix in lower case.  When doing a lookup on an indexed
variable pointer field, if the user entered the prefix in lower case or
mixed case, but the prefix was in upper case on the file, the lookup
failed.  NOIS: ISL-0699-52609.
 
Routine: DICUIX2
----------------
UNDEF error in lookup.  It was discovered here that an UNDEF error could
occur if the code used to build index information for the classic lookup
^DIC or the Finder FIND^DIC could not determine what field was indexed.
 
Routines: DICQ, DICQ1, DICUIX1
------------------------------
Question mark help was very slow when a fairly large file pointed to a
very large file like the PATIENT file. We were building a temporary index.
The algorithm that decides when to build an index was changed. Also, in
question mark help, we won't ever build a temporary index, but will
instead $O through the index on the pointer, so records will not be in
alphabetic sequence. This sequence was always used on pointers in V21.
NOIS: MAC-0999-63042
 
Routine: DIC5
-------------
When a numeric lookup value is entered and indexed field is a pointer,
make lookup by IEN work the way it did in version 21.  NOIS:
FGH-1099-30988, PTH-1099-21795, BHH-1099-41454
 
Routine: DIC3
-------------
Lookups on the DRUG file by synonym were selecting the right drug, but
displaying the wrong .01 field value. This happened when DIC(0) contained
an "O", there was more than one exact match on the SYNONYM index to the
lookup value, but all but one match were screened out by a DIC("S")
screen.  NOIS: BHH-1099-40749, CAH-1099-31208, ISB-1099-33134,
IOW-1099-42292, POP-1099-42462, TUC-1099-61597
 
Routine: DIC
------------
DIC("W") was being set earlier in a call to ^DIC in Version 22 than it was
in Version 21.  This caused an UNDEF error to occur in some files with a
user-defined lookup. This change restores backwards compatibility in this
area to V21. NOIS: MUR-0999-31608
 
Routine: DICF4
--------------
When a call to FIND^DIC was made with the "M" flag, and an entry was found
on an index other than the first one in the list, an extra node was
returned containing the external index value, even if the FIELDS parameter
did not contain "IXE". This caused the Finder Delphi Component to display
the wrong values.  NOIS: BAY-1199-30365
 
Routine: DICA
-------------
If an UPDATE^DIE call is made and the FDA uses a LAYGO/Finding node to
lookup or add an entry at the top level of a file, and an Adding node is
used to add an entry into a multiple within that record, and the top level
record is added because it was not found, a null subscript error would
occur. For example, if the FDA is:
 
        FDA(1000,"?+1,",.01)="TEST ENTRY"
        FDA(1000.02,"+2,?+1,",.01)="TEST SUBENTRY"
 
and the Updater has to add TEST ENTRY to file #1000, a null subscript
error will occur.
 
 
Routines: DIE1,DIE2
-------------------
If ^DIE was used to edit a subfile directly, and that subfile was at least
two levels down from the top, ^DIE was not updating the DA array correctly
when the user went down into and back out of multiples within that
subfile. NOIS: ISW-0599-20886
 
Routine: DIEQ
-------------
Set the DA array to the subfile level if the user enters ? or ?? at the
Select prompt of a multiple. This ensures that xecutable help, screens on
pointer or sets, and input transforms on the .01 field of the multiple can
rely on the DA array to be at the subfile level, whether ? or ?? is
entered at the Select prompt or at the .01 field of the multiple.

Installation Instructions: 
==========================
** It is HIGHLY recommended that ALL Users and VISTA Background jobs to be
   STOPPED. Failure to do so may result in a 'source routine edited'
   error, the edits will be lost and records may be left in an
   inconsistent state.
**
 
     1.  AXP sites: Review your mapped routine set.  If any of the routine(s)
listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from
the mapped set at this time.
 
     2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.  This
option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
 
The environment check routine DIENVWRN will run automatically.  Routine 
DIENVWRN is sent in order to prevent the inadvertent queuing during the 
installation of this patch.
 
     3.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your system.
You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
 
     4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
following options:
 
            Print Transport Global 
            Compare Transport Global to Current System 
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
            Backup a Transport Global 
 
     5.  Inhibit users' login into the system.  The consequence of having
users on the system while installing this patch are that users editing
records will get a 'source routine edited' error, the edits will be lost
and records may be left in an inconsistent state.  Note that most of these
routines are heavily used in DHCP applications.
 
     6.  AXP Sites - Place TaskMan in a WAIT State.  
         OpenM/Cache Sites - STOP TaskMan.  
 
     7.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
option: 
            Select Installation Option: Install Package(s) 
            Select INSTALL NAME: DI*22.0*4
                                 ==========
 
            Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
and Protocols? 
 
 
     8.  AXP Sites - After the patch has been installed, rebuild your map set,
if necessary. 
 
     9.  AXP Sites - Remove TaskMan from WAIT State.  
         OpenM/Cache Sites - Restart TaskMan.  
 
    10.  Enable users' login.

Y2K Waiver ID#:  Y2KW0001               Y2K Waiver Status: Approved
 
&gt;&gt;              This patch may be installed during the Y2K Moratorium,
either BEFORE 12/15/99 or AFTER 1/15/2000.
 
&gt;&gt;             This patch MAY NOT be installed between 12/15/1999 and
1/15/2000 (the Y2K Lockdown Period).
 
Bug Fix: 
========
1.  If a user specified a print field whose data type definition is a
Date/Time and they used a date Function along with the Count(!) operator,
the FileMan internal representation would be printed.  For example,
!MONTH(DATE FIELD)
    (NOIS: SAJ-1198-72266)
 
2.  Previous to this patch FileMan Sorts were limited to 7 levels.
With this patch the maximum number of Sort levels has been increased to
15.  
    (NOIS: WBP-0795-21830; DAY-0297-41337)
 
3.  When computing global length and comparing it to what was set in the
MUMPS OPERATING SYSTEM file, Global Subscript truncation would begin
before it was necessary.
    (NOIS: IOW-0998-40306)
 
4.  When a Sort contain a Boolean expression, for example, MY FIELD["A",
the Boolean operator was getting concatenated with the field name such
that a user could not edit the Sort template.
    (NOIS: ISA-0395-10001)
 
5.  Improvement to Descriptive Statistics and correction to Histogram
report header.
 
6.  If a user used the dot syntax for a date and the field is a DATE type
and the TIME can be entered, an "????Invalid Entry" error message would be
displayed or the data would not be displayed even though there was data
that should have been displayed.  For example:
 
    GO TO FOIA REQUESTED DATE: LAST// 1.MAR.97
 
    (NOIS: CLA-0197-20856, VAC-1197-21817)
 
7.  If a user was using the "!" in a print field and printed the same
field again, an erroneous Count was reported which was twice the number of
counted items.
 
    Example #1: In this example the output is correct as documentated the
    v22 Getting Started Manual, Section: Printing Statistics Only.

Miscellaneous bug fixes in the FileMan lookup ^DIC routines
 
Routines: DIC1, DIC2, DIC3
==========================
Support the undocumented "U" flag so that MailMan can get the same display
on one of their lookups as they did in V21. This supports a lookup on the
index with no transforms. I.e., the code expects the lookup value to be an
internal format (of a pointer, date, etc.), and will look on the index for
a match, and will not try to convert the lookup value in any way. Reported
by Gary Beuschel on a local message at the San Francisco ISC.
 
Routines: DIC, DIC1
===================
Make the "Y" flag in DIC(0) work the same as it did in version 21.  This
undocumented flag is supposed to make ^DIC return a list of entry numbers
that match the lookup value in Y(n) where 'n' is an IEN. The FIND^DIC call
is now a better way to do the same thing. Reported by Lucille Barrios on a
FORUM mail message.
 
Routines: DICLIX1, DICU11
=========================
I found during my testing that in cases where the Lister decides to build
a temporary index on a pointer or variable pointer because it's the
fastest way to return the list in order, I needed to save the internal
pointer or variable pointer on the temporary list, in case the user asked
to have it returned in the output.
 
Routine: DICA
=============
With the "E" flag, UPDATE^DIE assumes that the values passed in the FDA
are in external form. Also, for LAYGO/Finding (?+) nodes, the value of the
.01 field is used as a lookup value to see if an existing record should be
edited, or a new record added. Prior to this change, the Updater used the
internal form of the .01 as a lookup value, rather than the external form.
If the .01 is a pointer or variable, this meant the lookup would fail. For
DINUM'd pointers, this resulted in the Dialog error message #302, "Entry
'xxx' already exists" to be returned.

  This patch may be installed at any time during the Y2K Moratorium
  (including the 12/15/1999 thru 1/15/2000 Y2K lockdown).
 
This patch fixes a problem that occurs when you edit a pointer field that
has a screen and allows LAYGO into the pointed-to file. If the variable D
happens to be set when the input transform of the pointer field is
executed and isn't changed by the input transform, ^DIE is passing it to
MIX^DIC1 to do the lookup on the pointed-to file, even though D isn't a
valid list of index names.
 
The problem can manifest itself as bad variable name errors at S+2^DIQ:1
or null subscript errors at N5+16^DICN0 when the DEBTOR field (#9) of the
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE file (#430) is edited.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch fixes the following problem: If a new-style cross-reference is
defined on a field, ^DIE or FileMan's 'ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES' is
used to edit a multiple field and the field with the new-style
cross-reference, then the X1 array (which contains the old values of the
fields in the cross-references) may be set incorrectly after the user
descends into and back out of the multiple.
 
For example, suppose MFIELD is a multiple field, a new-style
cross-reference contains field MFIELD1, and you edit the fields as
follows:
 
  Select MFIELD: ENTRY 1// &lt;RET&gt;
    MFIELD1: TEST 1// &lt;RET&gt;
  Select MFIELD: &lt;RET&gt;
  FIELD1: first// second
  
When the new-style cross reference on FIELD1 is executed, X1 and X1(1)
contain 'second' instead of 'first'.

Fixes several bugs in the FileMan lookup ^DIC routines and the finder
FIND^DIC.
 
Y2K Waiver ID#:  Y2KW0001               Y2K Waiver Status: Approved
 =&gt; This patch MAY NOT be installed between 12/15/1999 and 1/15/2000
    (the Y2K Lockdown Period).
 =&gt; This patch may be installed during the Y2K Moratorium
    - AFTER 1/15/2000.
 
 
Routines: DIC1, DIC2, DIC5 
==========================
When the "T" flag in DIC(0) is used, FileMan displays the field on which a 
match is made, as it presents the entries. This was happening even when DIC(0)
did not contain "E". This patch prevents the display unless DIC(0) contains
"E".   (Found by Gary Beuschel, MailMan developer).
 
Routines: DIC3, DICF, DICF2, DICL2
===========================
A .01 field that was 240 characters long caused a SUBSCRIPT error to occur
in the Finder FIND^DIC calls. I also found a similar problem in ^DIC if
the lookup value was very long. This patch corrects both problems.
(Reported by Hellevi, Ruonamaa of Finland.)
 
Routines: DICM3
===============
When doing a lookup on an indexed variable pointer field where the pointer
had a screen, the screen logic wasn't being honored during lookup on the
pointed-to file. Found by Frank Stalling and Paul Sharp. NOIS:
ISD-1199-72724, SLC-1299-51331.
 
Routines: DICM0
===============
If a New Style index on the .01 field has a TRANSFORM FOR STORAGE on it,
then don't allow LAYGO to the file while the value is in it's format after
going through the transform, as it may not be proper internal storage
format. An example is a date transformed to backwards collating sequence,
9999999-2991214. Found by developer.
 
Routines: DIC, DIC0
===================
The new feature that makes ^DIC set DIC("P") so that it doesn't have to be
set as an input variable by the developer when allowing LAYGO to
multiples, wasn't working correctly. Found by Jerald F Rutherford. NOIS:
ISL-1299-51117.
 
Routines: DIC1, DIC2, DICM, DICM1
=================================
In the process of testing the Name Standardization project for the New
Person file, it was discovered that when there was a transform on the "B"
index, the index value wasn't being displayed correctly during lookup.
 
Routines: DIC4
==============
When the new "T" flag was used in DIC(0), developer discovered that a hard
error could occur if one of the indexes was a new style index with
TRANSFORM FOR STORAGE code. The error happened during the code that
executes the transform against the lookup value, then does a second lookup
on the index looking for a match to the transformed lookup value.
 
Routines: DIC3
==============
Entries were not being found doing lookup when DIC(0) contained the
undocumented flag "U", as it is when doing a relational jump using a
backwards pointer. NOIS: BIL-1299-32021
 
Routine: DICUIX
===============
Look for the new field 'TRANSFORM FOR LOOKUP' in the INDEX file.
Previously during lookup, if FileMan failed to find a match to the lookup
value, and if a lookup index had TRANSFORM FOR STORAGE code, FileMan
executed that against the lookup value and tried to find a match with the
new transformed value. Now it uses the TRANSFORM FOR LOOKUP code instead.
The TRANSFORM FOR STORAGE code is used only to transform an entries field
value before storing it in the index for that entry.
 
Routines: DIC3, DIC5, DICM
===========================
Because of the place where the DICR array was being NEWed when DIC(0)
contained the new "T" flag, I was losing a flag that told me I asked the
user whether they wanted to add a new entry while I had an internal,
transformed lookup value to stuff in the .01 field. This was causing me to
ask again whether they wanted to add a new entry, after all the transforms
were done.  Found by developer.
 
Routine: DIKCFORM
=================
When a new-style index is created and a TRANSFORM FOR STORAGE code was
defined on one of the cross-reference values, the TRANSFORM FOR DISPLAY
field was made required. This change makes the TRANSFORM FOR DISPLAY
optional, even if a TRANSFORM FOR STORAGE is defined, since the internal
form of the index value may already be readable to the user.
 
Routines: DINIT2A3, DINIT2A4, DINIT0FA, DINIT0FB
================================================
Add a new field to the Index file (#.11), Cross-References Values multiple
(#.114). The field is TRANSFORM FOR LOOKUP (#5.3) and is used by FileMan's
lookup utilities (see change to routine DICUIX above). Note that this new
field is transported as part of the KIDS build for this patch, so there is
no need to re-run DINIT to get the new field installed.
 
Routines: DINIT0FA, DINIT0FB
============================
When a new-style cross-reference is edited, provide a default for
Subscript Number only for Regular-type indexes, not MUMPS-type indexes.
Also, set the Subscript Length to 30 for Free Text and MUMPS fields only
if the the field is used as a subscript. Note that these changes to the
ScreenMan form for editing new-style cross-references is transported as
part of the KIDS build for this patch, so there is no need to re-run DINIT
to get these changes.
 
Routine: DIKCP1
===============
Include the new field TRANSFORM FOR LOOKUP (#5.3) in Data Dictionary
Listings.
