<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch is an enhancement project that will make major changes to the 
CONTACT ISSUE CODE file (#745.2).  Existing codes will be inactivated, 
and new codes will be exported, resulting in a smaller list of active 
codes.  Only these nationally exported codes will be in use.
 
This patch will export seven new entires in the CUSTOME SERVICE STANDARD  
file (#745.6).  These codes will be added in order to bring the Customer 
Service Standards field better match the Customer Satisfaction survey.  
These codes are not Customer Service Standards, but can be tracked in the 
same way in existing reports.  Each has a suffix of Non-CSS to 
distinguish it from the original ten Customer Service Standards.  The 
Customer Service Standard field in the CONTACT ISSUE CODE file (#745.2) 
has been populated and is being exported with the patch.
 
This patch changes the input transform of the Division field (#37) of the 
CONSUMER CONTACT file (#745.1).  Currently, only integrated sites 
received a prompt for Division, and the choices were limited to those 
Medical Centers making up the integrate group.  Now, all sites will get 
the prompt and choices are amongst those MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION file 
(#40.8) entries which point to the INSTITUTION file (#4).  The Division 
field remains a pointer to the INSTITUTION file (#4).
 
A new field, Internal Appeal (#43) has been added to the CONSUMER CONTACT 
file (#745.1).  This field will store whether or not a Report of Contact 
will go through the Internal Appeal process.  The Ad Hoc Report has been 
updated to include this new field.  Internal Appeal will take the place 
of the Refer to SEAT field.
 
The user will no longer be prompted for the Level of Satisfaction field 
(#36 of the CONSUMER CONTACT file (#745.1)).
 
The second problem was that the division field pointed to the INSTITUTION
file (#4) and only legacy sites were to be available as choices.  With
this patch any entry in the site's MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION file (#40.8)
that points to the INSTITUTION file will be available. Both integrated and
non-integrated sites will be able to enter the division. 
 
This patch will also correct two problems with the Patient Representative
Roll-up.  
 
The first problem dealt with the fact that once a record was transmitted,
it would be evaluated for re-transmission only when it was closed.  Also,
the roll-up did not take into account the fact that records can be
re-opened and edited after closing.  Any record that was re-opened was not
being evaluated for re-transmission.  With this patch any record edited
will be evaluated for transmission regardless of whether or not it was
previously transmitted, independent of record status.

Subject:  Employee Lookup Bugs in PATS
 
Category:  ROUTINE
 
Description:
===========
The Patient Advocate Tracking System (PATS) has two remote procedure calls
(RPC) that return data from the NEW PERSON file. The RPC names are QACV
KEY HOLDERS VLH and QACV PERSON LOOKUP VLH. Both RPCs execute the same
code in routine QACVEMPX. The RPCs return NAME, TITLE and MAIL CODE for
selected employees.
 
Problem #1
----------
Currently, if the TITLE or MAIL CODE contain an ampersand character (&amp;), 
the PATS java code interprets this as a reserved xml character and fails.
This is experienced in 4 places in PATS.
 
1. Adding a New Report of Contact (ROC), Cover Sheet tab, the system
should display a drop-down list of Information Takers. Without the patch,
the drop-down list of Info Takers is not present.
 
2. Edit a ROC, search by Information Taker option, should display a 
drop-down list of Information Takers. Without the patch, the drop-down
list of Info Takers is not present.
 
3. Edit a ROC, Resolution tab, adding a new Issue Code, when user tries to
look up an Employee Involved. Without the patch, the users receive the 
error: "A problem was encountered while attempting to communicate with 
VistA. This problem appears to be related with VistALink. Try again. If
this problem persists contact the support desk for further assistance."
 
4. Edit a ROC, Notification tab, when user tries to look up an Employee 
to send a notification. Without the patch, the users receive the 
error: "A problem was encountered while attempting to communicate with 
VistA. This problem appears to be related with VistALink. Try again. If
this problem persists contact the support desk for further assistance."
 
The fix is to use the Kernel routine $$SYMENC^MXMLUTL in routine QACVEMPX
to replace reserved xml symbols in the TITLE and MAIL CODE output with
their coded values.
 
Problem #2
----------
The NEW PERSON file may contain last names standardized under an old 
format that removed all punctuation except for hyphens, and last names 
standardized under a newer format that also leaves spaces and apostrophes 
in the last name. Thus you may find names like O'BRIEN as well as OBRIEN.
 
When a user enters O'Brien as a lookup value, PATS was only using the old 
name standardization, so was only finding matches to the last name 
OBRIEN, but was not finding O'BRIEN.
 
This occurs in two different places in PATS.
 
1. Edit a ROC, Resolution tab, adding a new Issue Code, when user tries to
look up an Employee Involved.
 
2. Edit a ROC, Notification tab, when user tries to look up an Employee 
to send a notification.
 
After the patch is installed, if a user enters a last name containing
either an apostrophe or a space, PATS will look for matches to the name
both with and without the apostrophe or space. Thus, if a user enters
O'Brien, PATS will find names matching both O'BRIEN and OBRIEN, if there
are any.
