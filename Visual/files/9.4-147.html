<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses three issues.
1.  When a facility name is changed in the Institution File (^DIC(4)),
ROES users have a problem bringing up their existing ROES orders because
ROES uses the facility name as an identifier.  This patch will change the
facility lookup routines to look at the facility number instead of the
name.  This becomes a major issue with the release of the Institution Gold
File which will standardize facility names across the VA.
2.  Secondly, this patch will fix some MailMan message addressing
problems. Sections of obsolete code will be removed and some new MailMan
API's will be incorporated into the routines. These changes will fix the
errors some sites reported when resequencing the Postmaster's inbox.
3.  Finally, the print request is ignored when a user enters a lowercase
"p" when queueing the "List Orders by Patient or Status" Report.  This has
been fixed so the user may use either case.
 
ROES V2.0 patches 1,2,7,8 and 15 are required to be installed prior to
this patch.  Since RMPF*2.0*1 was not a KIDS Build, KIDS will not look for
it during the installation process.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses 2 issues regarding the ROES 2.0 package:
 
1.  DAY-0201-40031 &lt;ENDOFILE&gt;READ+1^RMPFDE Error
 
        o  The end of file error has been corrected.  This was happening
           because of the extra print that was printing on the bottom of
           the report.  This should have been printing on the screen.
           This text has been removed from the report.
 
        o  The ability to print the report has been added for partial
           screen displays.
 
        o  The error occurring when print to a slave printer has been
           corrected.  This was a problem in the code not returning back
           to the proper line tag.
 
2.  Enhancements for Bundled Pricing
 
        o  2nd year warrenty is the only extra component available on new
           Custom Hearing Aid Orders.  This patch will add a new field,
           "AVAILABLE W/BUNDLED PRICING", to the 791811.2 file.  This
           field will be the 4th piece of the zero node.  This patch
           will set this field for 2nd year warranty to "yes", and all
           other extra components will be set to "no", or left blank.
 
        o  This patch will add the field "AVAIL WITH EXTRA COMP ORDER"
           field in 791811.2 file.  This field will be the 5th piece
           of the zero node.  The only extra component that is not
           available after the initial Custom Hearing Aid Purchase is
           the 2nd year warranty.  This field for the 2nd year warranty
           will be set to 1, for "NO".
 
        o  The Product file, and Component file will be updated with the
           new contract items.

<dt>DESCRIPTION OF ENHANCEMENTS:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
The Remote Order Entry System (ROES) version 3.0 was developed
at the VA Denver Distribution Center(DDC).  It is a changeover to
a GUI(windows) based product that allows ordering of goods and
services over the internet and greatly reduces the amount of 
maintenance and support at the local sites.  All of the product
and service information will be kept and maintained at the
DDC, with real-time information on orders and inventory.
  
There are 2 new GUI applications: ROES3.exe and ROES3DeskTop.exe.
  
*****Please refer to the INSTALLATION GUIDE and TECHNICAL MANUAL
for installation and setup directions *****
  
(1) ROES3.exe is designed to be attached to the CPRS Tools Menu. This
application uses the currently selected patient, looks up the current
eligibility information and connects to the DDC ROES 3 web site.  If an
accepted eligibility is not found, the user selects a proposed eligibility
and triggers the sending of the request to PSAS for approval.
  
(2) ROES3DeskTop.exe is designed to be referenced from the user's 
desktop, as it is not tied to a particular patient.  It is used for
station orders, parameter setting, and certain updates to already
existing patient orders.

Technical Description
=====================
  
1. New file introduced with this patch:
  
  The ROES ELIGIBILITY CONFIRMATION file (#791814) is introduced to
  store the eligibility request information.
  
2. New VistA Options introduced with this patch:
 
   a) RMPF ROES3 is used to establish a context and allow access to
     the 2 new executables.  It must be assigned to all users of 
     the CPRS Tools or DeskTop applications.
 
   b) RMPFDE2 is used by PSAS to accept/edit/reject eligibility for
     ROES3 orders.  This is a standard VistA option and must be
     placed on a user's menu.
 
   c) RMPFDE4 is the option to be scheduled to remind all PSAS users
     in the RMPF ROES UPDATES (PSAS) mail group that requests for
     eligibility approval are waiting for approval.
 
3. New VistA Remote Procedures introduced with this patch:
 
   a) RMPFDEMOG collects demographic data for transmission to the DDC
     for the site, user and patient.
 
   b) RMPFELIG calculates the approved ROES 3 eligibility.
 
   c) RMPF ELIG MSG sends the suggested eligibility to PSAS for approval.
 
4. Mail groups in ROES 3
 
   a) The ROES 2 mail group RMPF ROES UPDATES (ASPS) continues to be
      used, only this time it is to alert audiologists when a request
      for eligibility approval has been acted upon.
 
   b) The ROES 2 mail group RMPF ROES UPDATES (PSAS) continues to be
      used in ROES 3 to receive notification that a request for eligibility
      is waiting to be processed.
 
Installation Instructions:
==========================
  
This patch was created with Kernel V8 KIDS.
***Please refer to the complete instructions in the Installation Guide***
  
1. This is a completely new installation, so it will not affect any
current ROES 2 users or others on the system. It can be run parallel
to the existing ROES 2 system, until ROES 2 is no longer supported.
You do not need to restrict users from signing on or to lock any
options.
  
2. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.
This option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
                           
3. You DO NOT need to stop Taskman or the background filers. None
of the routines require mapping, so mapping does not need to be
disabled.
 
4. Using the Kernel Installation and Distribution System menu
(KIDS), you may choose the following options prior to installing
this patch:
 
  a) All routines are new, so there should be no need to Backup
     the Transport Global.
 
  b) Again, this is an all new module, so there should be no
     need to Compare the Transport Global to the Current System.
 
  c) Verify Checksums in the Transport Global.  This option will
     allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
     in the Transport Global.
 
5. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation'
   menu.
  
   a) Select INSTALL NAME: ROES 3.0
 
   b) When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon
      completion of install?' YES// respond "NO"
 
   c) When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
      install?' YES// respond "NO"
 
   d) When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu
      Options and Protocols?' NO// respond "NO"
 
   e) When prompted 'Want to MOVE routines to other CPUs?' YES//
      respond "NO"
  
6. Confirm the presence of the two mail groups described under 'Technical
   Description' and enter the names of the respective mail group
   coordinators if necessary.
 
7. Unzip the ROES3.ZIP file containing the 2 new executables: 
   ROES3.exe and ROES3DeskTop.exe
   They can be placed on the network according to local policy,
   in a place where they can be referenced from CPRS Tools and
   from the user's workstation.
  
8. Assign the Broker option RMPF ROES3 to users of either application.
 
9. Add the application ROES3.exe to the CPRS Tools menu.
 
10. Add a link to the ROES3DeskTop application on the selected user's
   workstation desktop.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1 SEQ #1</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2004-09-03 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses several issues that have come up at VAMC stations
as a result of the release of the ROES 3.0 package. All issues
addressed in this patch are related to the ROES3.exe application that
runs from the CPRS Tools menu, as opposed to the ROES3DeskTop.exe
application.
 Issues addressed in this patch are:
- A disruption of the parameters passed to the Denver Distribution
  Center(DDC) if the patient's phone number contained a '#' sign.
- A failure to pass the priority group to the DDC if the patient had a
  calculated ROES eligibility of SC or COM.
- The "Date of Death" was not being transmitted consistently.
- The inability to exit the "Display ROES3 Eligibility Requests[RMPFDE2]"
  option by entering a circumflex(^).
- The "Display ROES3 Eligibility Requests[RMPFDE2]" option did not allow
  printing to a slave device.
- The selection of a proposed eligibility is now mandatory before the
  request for determination will be submitted.
- The eligibility request date, the requesting user and the date the
  request was acted on were added to the popup message.
- The removal of the ability to do a patient lookup. The application
  should be run from CPRS Tools where the patient is already known.
 
In addition, the Audiology and Speech Pathology Service(ASPS) National
Program Office requested that:
- PG4 be added as a selectable eligibility. This includes veterans who
  have a Catastrophic Disability and are in Priority Group 4.
- The text 'Veterans receiving benefits under 38 U.S.C. 1151 (benefits for
  individuals disabled by treatment or vocational rehabilitation)' be
  added to the help text for category EP3.
 
 
Functional Change
=================
The Black Hills Health Care System reported a problem with the ROES3.exe
application causing excessive CPU usage on the desktop systems. The
problem was isolated to the part of the application that waited for
Internet Explorer to exit and then automatically pulled information from
the clipboard and formatted it as text for CPRS Notes.  This
functionality is removed by this patch. By removing this 'listener', the
user will no longer be able to paste the 'formatted' order information
into a note in CPRS. Users will continue to have the ability to highlight
the order information and copy and paste the unformatted information.  The
DDC is looking into more efficient ways to restore this functionality in a
future enhancement if it is still desired by the user community.
 
NOIS references addressed in this patch
=======================================
 
MAC-0104-61099
problem:
When a '#' sign was returned by the ADD^VADPT call in the patient's phone
number, it created a break in the URL that was used in establishing a
browser session to the ROES 3.0 web application from CPRS Tools. This
usually showed up as an eligibility error at the DDC.
 
resolution:
Routine RMPFRPC1 was modified to screen out any special characters from
the values used by the URL in ROES3.exe. The executable also has an added
function that verifies the removal of those characters.
 
SBY-0404-30089
problem:
When the user attempted to print the ROES 3 Eligibility Request list to
a slave printer, it produced an error at LIST^RMPFDE2 and didn't print.
 
resolution:
When the print routine was updated, the slave printer part was overlooked.
This problem has been fixed in routine RMPFDE2.
 
WRJ-0104-10319 and MAC-0304-61626
problem:
ROES3 message boxes or the application itself were coming up behind the
CPRS screens.
 
resolution:
A splash screen was added to the ROES3.exe application and it will give
focus to the ROES 3.0 application in most instances. Situations may
exist where other applications have priority.

ROES 3.0  (RMPF*3.0)
 
This patch contains the following enhancements and problem resolutions:
=======================================================================
 
The following routines and program have been modified:
 
1. RMPFDE2 - This routine was modified to allow Prosthetics and
   Sensory Aids Service(PSAS) users to exit the 'Display ROES 3
   Eligibility Requests[RMPFDE2]' option by entering '^' as well as the
   &lt;Q&gt;uit. The print of the eligibility request list to a slave printer
   was not working and has now been fixed.
 
2. RMPFDE3 - 'Eligibility' was added to the VistA message text.
   Catastrophically disabled veterans in Priority Group 4 have
   been added to the selectable eligibilities.
 
3. RMPFRPC0 - In the original release priority groups 1 and 2 were
   omitted from the message transmission because the priority group
   was not obtained before the determination of SC or COM eligibility.
   This oversight has been corrected.  Also, in the pop-up message
   from PSAS, the eligibility request date, the requesting user and the
   date action was taken were added.
 
4. RMPFRPC1 - A section was added to remove special characters
   (@#%?&amp;/\) from the values that are used in the URL. Also, the
   failure of the 'Date of Death' to be transmitted to the DDC has
   been corrected.
 
5. The ROES 3 CPRS Tools option executable(ROES3.exe) was modified
   to:
   -Correct the spelling of 'priority'.
   -The title of the selection box was changed to 'You must select a
    Proposed Eligibility', and a selection was made mandatory.
   -A splash screen was added to the executable to help alleviate the
    problem of the application not getting focus in front of the CPRS
    screens. Circumstances may still exist where the CPRS screen has
    priority. In those situations the user can &lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Tab&gt; to view the
    Audiogram screen.
   -The portion of the module that was used by developers to lookup a
    patient was removed. That section was not meant to be used by
    field stations.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
=========================
 
ROES users should be off the system while these routines are being
installed. This patch should be installed during non-peak hours to
minimize disruption. Installation will take approximately 5 minutes
or more, depending on the CPRS Tools menu structure at your site.
 
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  Answer
     YES to the prompt 'Want to Continue with Load? YES//'.  This
     will load the KIDS package onto your system.
 
 2.  Review your mapped set.  If the routines listed in the ROUTINE
     SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped
     set at this time.
 
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
 
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
     prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter RMPF*3.0*1):
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes to routines that will be made when
         the patch is installed.
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the Transport
         Global.
 
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package RMPF*3.0*1.

<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2013-07-02 13:03:27</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-17.html">USER,SEVENTEEN</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
This patch addresses several issues that have come up at the VA Medical 
Centers since the first release of the ROES package. All issues addressed 
in this patch are related to the ROES application that runs from the CPRS 
Tools menu (ROES3.exe). The ROES Desktop application (ROES3Desktop.exe) 
is only included for issues 2 and 3 below.
 
 Issues addressed in this patch are:
 
1. As approved by the PSAS Program Office, all Veteran eligibility 
determinations calculated by the software will be automatically 
approved.  Veteran eligibility requests will no longer be sent to the 
Prosthetic and Sensory Aids Service (PSAS) staff for approval.  Changes 
in the background calculations for Veteran eligibility are detailed in 
the Release Notes for this patch.
 
2. For added security, the web connection has been changed from 
clear http to secure http using the https protocol identifier.
 
3. Adjustments were made for 64 bit terminal servers to access and 
use the ROES web site.
 
4. Connections from CPRS to the ROES web server will only be allowed to 
actually enter the web site if they are from a VistA production account to
prevent false Veteran information from becoming a part of the national
database.
 
5. Menu options, routines, remote procedure calls and security keys 
from prior versions of ROES that are no longer needed will be removed.
        Obsolete Options removed:  RMPFDE2 and RMPFDE4
        Obsolete Routines removed:  RMPFDE1,RMPFDE2,RMPFDE3 and RMPFDE4
        Obsolete Keys removed:  RMPF SUPERVISOR and RMPF SYSTEM MANAGER
        Obsolete Remote Procedures removed: RMPF ELIG MSG and RMPFELIG
 
6. Modifications for VistA and Delphi coding standards are included.
 
7. Documentation has been updated regarding the removal of the 
eligibility interactions before connecting to ROES.

 This patch contains the following enhancements and problem resolutions:
 ==========================================================
 
 The ROES application requires that the user's browser have JAVA
 available and enabled in order to function.  Sun has not developed a
 64-bit version of JAVA, so on 64-bit terminal server installations the
 browser is not JAVA capable. This may prevent some ROES features from
 working properly. 64-bit installations also have a 32-bit browser
 which resides at a location different from the normal 32-bit location.
 That new location is:
        C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\IEXPLORE.EXE.
 
 The ROES executables that connect to the internet application have been
 modified to check for the 32-bit Internet Explorer at that location.
 This change will not affect any current 32-bit installations because, if 
 Internet Explorer is not found at that location, ROES will look in the
 usual installation directories:
        C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\IEXPLORE.EXE or
        C:\Program Files\PLUS!\Microsoft Internet\IEXPLORE.EXE
 
 On a 64-Bit installation, if the ROES application still does not work
 properly after installing the new executable, please ensure the path
 "C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\IEXPLORE.EXE" does exist on
 the workstation.
 
 All workstations accessing the ROES application from either CPRS or the
 desktop need to have the RPCBroker Listener running, as in the previous
 releases of ROES. Refer to the RPCBroker Installation Guide for further
 direction, if needed. It can be retrieved from http://www.domain.ext/vdl.
 
 The following VistA routines have been modified to address new standards
 guidelines.
 
 1. RMPFRPC0 - Eligibility calculations were modified for new rules and
    categories and is now called directly from RMPFRPC1 instead of from
    remote procedure call RMPFELIG.
 
 2. RMPFRPC1 - DDC changed to DALC. Added check to see if running from a
    production account. Comments were added and clarified.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
 
 Make a backup copy of the current ROES3.exe and ROES3Desktop.exe
 files (from a location where they currently are being used) to a
 backup location. Note the locations where all instances of those
 executables exist, for future maintenance.
 
 All obsolete options, routines, remote procedure calls and files from
 previous ROES versions will be removed during the installation. The list
 items being removed is listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY SECTION of the
 build.
 
 Only ROES users need be off the system while ROES*3.0*4 is being
 installed. This patch should be installed during non-peak hours to
 minimize disruption. The total installation may take 15 minutes or more,
 depending on the CPRS Tools menu structure and number of ROES and
 ROES Desktop executables to update at your site. Be sure that the KIDS
 install (steps 1-9) are completed before updating the executables (steps
 10-11). The KIDS install will run in less than 2 minutes.
  
 Review your mapped set.  If the routines listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY
 section of the build are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped
 set at this time.
 
  1.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. 
      Answer YES to the prompt 'Want to Continue with Load? YES//'.  This
      will load the KIDS package onto your system.
 
  2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
 
  3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter RMPF*3.0*4):
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will not
         backup any changes to DD's.
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes to routines that will be made 
         when the patch is installed.
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
         Transport Global.
 
  4.  Then choose the Install Package(s) option and select RMPF*3.0*4.
 
  5.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      NO//", respond NO (unless otherwise indicated)
 
  6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
      and Protocols? YES//', respond "YES". When prompted to select the
      options you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
           
             ROES3 OPTION ACCESS          [RMPF ROES3]
 
  7.  If prompted 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out of Order': 
      press &lt;return&gt;.
 
  8.  When prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//; respond '0.'
 
  9.  If you unmapped routines at the start, those SENT TO SITE
      should be returned to the mapped set once this part of the
      installation is complete.
 
 10.  Retrieve the file RMPF3_0P4.ZIP and extract files ROES3.exe and
      ROES3DeskTop.exe.
 
 11.  All existing instances of ROES3.exe and ROES3DeskTop.exe need to
      be replaced, regardless of whether they reside on server(s) or
      individual workstation(s).
 
      To do this, copy the new executable files to those locations,
      replacing the existing version. Take care NOT to inadvertently 
      replace the ROES3.exe file with the ROES3DeskTop.exe file,
      or vice versa. When this is completed properly, the command line
      option from CPRS Tools and the desktop links to ROES should continue
      to work without any modifications.
 
 If additional guidance is needed for the GUI installation, please refer
 to the ROES 3 Installation Guide on the System Design and Development 
 web page at:  http://www.domain.ext/vdl. Within the Clinical section look for
 'Remote Order Entry System (ROES)'.  Under that option you will find the
 Installation Guide, Security Guide, Technical Manual and User Manual.
