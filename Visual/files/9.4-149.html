        Voluntary Service Staff Instructions for patch ABSV*4*31


 After patch ABSV*4*31 is installed at a site, the Voluntary Service staff
 can begin the data cleansing process. The Systems Implementation (SI)
 group will give specific instructions to the Voluntary Service staff
 regarding the timing and other particulars of the migration.

 This process will start when the patch is received by the site and should
 be completed not later than 2 weeks before the sites scheduled conversion
 date.

 The patch installs a new menu on the Volunteer Timekeeping Activity menu.
 The new menu looks like this:

 Voluntary Data Migration Menu

   PREP   Prepare for Transition to VSS
   VAL    Validate Existing Data
   PRNT   Print Results of Data Validation
   VOL    Master Volunteer Edit
   DAIL   Daily Time Edit
   OCC    Occasional Hours Edit
   SEND   Send Voluntary Data to VSS
       **&gt; Locked with ABSV MIGRATION

 (Note: the Send option will appear only after patch 32 is installed.)

 This menu is locked with the already existing ABSV MGR Security Key; so,
 only holders of that key will be able to run these options.

 Briefly,

   PREP option does some initial setup for your site and sends information
 that is used to establish your site on the VSS centralized server.  Run
 this option once only.

   VAL option checks your existing data and creates a report of entries
 that contain inconsistent data that can be corrected before the data is
 sent to the new system.  This option can be run as often as you like.

   PRNT option displays the results of the Validate option.  It can be run
 as often as you like.

   VOL option allows the user to edit all the fields they need to correct
 a problem with the Volunteer information.

   DAIL option allows the user to edit all the fields they need to correct
 a problem with Regular Hours information.

   OCC option allows the user to edit all the fields they need to correct
 a problem with Occasional Hours information.

   SEND option sends the data to the new system.  It should be run only once
 unless SI instructs you to run it again.


 PREPARE FOR  TRANSITION TO VSS

 VSS will contain information about your Voluntary Service.  If your site is
 multi-divisional, it will contain information about each division to which
 Volunteer Hours are recorded.  Most of the information about your Voluntary
 Service and its staff will entered by Voluntary Service personnel using the
 new VSS web interface.  However, some data is needed for initial setup of
 your site.  The main purpose of the Prepare for Transition to VSS option is
 to gather this preliminary information and to send it to the people who will
 do the initial data entry.

 Following is the dialog you will see when running this option.

 Select Voluntary Data Migration Menu Option: Prepare for Transition to VSS

 You are starting the process that will move 
 Voluntary Timekeeping data to the new 
 Voluntary Service System application.

 First, information about your site will be collected.
 Your Volunteer Daily Time file will be scanned to find 
 all sites referenced.  This will take some time.

 Done.

 Your primary site number is 605
 Hours are recorded to the following sites:
                    605

 The option has looked through your Volunteer Daily Time file and identified
 all the sites (or institutions) to which regular volunteer hours have been
 recorded since 10/1/1996.  Displayed are your primary station number and
 the station numbers of all the sites for which hours were found.

 If this information appears to be incorrect, answer the following question
 "NO" and contact SI for further instructions.  Otherwise, answer "YES" and
 proceed.

 Is this site information correct? YES

 Now an entry for your site is made in a new file that was installed on your
 system by patch 31, the Voluntary Migration Log file.  The data recorded
 when running the migration options is stored in this file.


 Making an entry in the Voluntary Migration Log file.

 You will be asked for information about each station to which hours are
 recorded.  In this example, only one station is involved.  If your
 multi-divisional site has more than one station, answer the questions for
 each station even if the answers are the same.


                    Add information for Station Number 605

 STATION NAME: Loma Linda Test
 VISN: 22
 STREET ADDRESS LINE 1: 1 Hospital Way
 STREET ADDRESS LINE 2: &lt;RET&gt;
 CITY: Loma Linda
 STATE: CA
 ZIP CODE: 99999
 USER ADMIN'S LAST NAME: Boss
 USER ADMIN'S FIRST NAME: Big
 USER ADMIN'S MIDDLE NAME: B.
 USER ADMIN'S NT USERNAME: vhamaster\vhaisfbossb

 The first seven questions are self-explanatory.  

 The questions about the User Administrator refer to the lead person at
 your site. That person will be responsible for entering site data and
 setting up other local users.  Often, it will be the Voluntary Service
 Chief.

 It is very important that this person's NT Username is entered correctly.
 You must enter both the domain and the username separated by a "\".

 Next you are asked for the e-mail address of the recipient of this
 information.  The message is sent via MailMan to a Microsoft Exchange
 address.  SI will provide you with the necessary e-mail address. You can
 also send the message to local MailMan recipients.  In the following
 example, John Smith is the user.

 Your local IRM must assure that mail can be sent successfully to the
 domain.ext domain.  The sending of this message will be a test of that
 domain, which will also be used when the actual data is sent.

 Sending a message containing information about your site.
 Enter a Recipient of the Institution Creation message: first.last@domain.ext
 Enter a Recipient of the Institution Creation message:
                                SMITH,JOHN (use your own name here)
 Enter a Recipient of the Institution Creation message: &lt;RET&gt;
 Message sent.  Message number: 8250639

 This completes the preparatory option on the MUMPS system.  SI will
 contact you after your site has been initialized on VSS and the new
 system is ready to recieve your data.  

 You can now proceed with the review of your local data.


 VALIDATE EXISTING DATA:

   PREP   Prepare for Transition to VSS
   VAL    Validate Existing Data
   PRNT   Print Results of Data Validation
   VOL    Master Volunteer Edit
   DAIL   Daily Time Edit
   OCC    Occasional Hours Edit
   SEND   Send Voluntary Data to VSS

 Select Voluntary Data Migration Menu Option: Validate Existing Data

 Data that will be moved to the new Voluntary Service System database
 will now be checked for consistency.

 The result will be recorded in the Voluntary Migration Log File.
 You will have the opportunity to print these results.

 The data validation process will review all of the entries that will be
 moved from your VistA VTK system to the new VSS server.  A report will be
 made containing each entry that has incorrect or inconsistent data.
 You can use that report to correct entries so that a complete set of data
 is moved to the new system.

 Entries that are reported as containing a problem will not be migrated to
 the new system unless the problem is corrected in your data.

 Because there are many records involved, running this option may take some
 time.  Particularly time consuming will be the validation of the Volunteer
 Regular Hours.

 A dialog indicating progress is presented as the validation goes on.  When
 the check of each file is done, the number of entries with errors is
 displayed.

 
 Do you want to proceed? YES

 The data checking on your system is complete!

 After the validation finishes, you can immediately print the results.
 Whether you print it at this time or not, the information on incorrect
 entries is stored and can be printed at any later time. 

 Do you want to print the results now? YES
 DEVICE: HOME//&lt;RET&gt;VIRTUAL CONNECTION    Right Margin: 80//&lt;RET&gt; 

 The error reports are grouped by type and indicate the record number (IEN)
 of the record that contains the problem.  For the volunteers, the name of
 the volunteer is also shown to help in identification.
 
 This completes the data validation option.  This option can be rerun with
 results reflecting the status of your data at the time it is rerun.

 You do not, however, need to rerun the option just to view the results of
 a prior run.  You can print previous results.

 You can print results of the Examination of Existing Data 
 by selecting the date/time that the examination was done.

 Note that the validation results are stored by date and time run.  The
 simplest way to  choose the results to print is to input the date that the
 validation was run.  In the following example, the results of validation run
 "TODAY" are requested.  You select the specific set of data validated to
 print.  In this example, the results for Regular and Occasional Hours are
 selected.

 CORRECTING DATA:

 You are requested to run the data validation option weeks before the actual
 switch to the new system so that you have the opportunity to correct invalid
 records.  Corrected records will be migrated to the new system while those
 remaining with an error will be rejected.

 The method of correction will depend on the problem.  In some cases, you
 will have to contact volunteers; in others, you will have to refer to paper
 records.  When the necessary information is obtained, you will usually be
 able to use the existing VTK options to make the change.  You can also use
 the three options supplied in this patch: Master Volunteer Edit , Daily Time
 Edit, Occasional Hours Edit. If you cannot use the normal options, contact
 your local IRM.  If your local IRM cannot resolve the issue they should file
 a NOIS report and NVS will assist in getting the problem resolved.

 Following is an example of correcting Volunteer data.  Copied below is a
 line from the validation report run above:

 Volunteer record #3418 with Name MAYO,MARION has incorrect sex data.

 A volunteer with record number 3418 in the Voluntary Master file whose name
 is Marion Mayo somehow has incorrect information in the SEX field.  It is
 unimportant how that erroneous data got there.  Suppose you determine that
 Marion is a woman.  Correct the error by using the Register/Edit Volunteer
 in Master File option:

 
 Select Master File Maintenance Menu Option: Register/Edit Volunteer in
 Master File

 Select Volunteer Name: `3418  MAYO,MARION

 Note: the volunteer is selected by putting an accent grave (`) in front of
 the entry number from the error report.  This method should work for any
 data you are correcting, regardless of file.  In this case, you could have
 also used the name.

 Do you wish to Add/Edit Volunteer specific data? YES//&lt;RET&gt;   (YES)

 NICKNAME: &lt;RET&gt;
 PSEUDO INDICATOR: &lt;RET&gt;
 SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER: 999-99-9999// &lt;RET&gt;
 STREET ADDRESS #1: 1 Main St.// &lt;RET&gt;
 STREET ADDRESS #2: &lt;RET&gt;
 CITY: MORENO VALLEY// &lt;RET&gt;
 STATE: CALIFORNIA// &lt;RET&gt;
 ZIP CODE: 92553// &lt;RET&gt;

 Here the source of the error is clear.  Somehow a "Z" was input into the
 SEX field.  The data validation option identified this as being incorrect.
 Here, it is corrected to F for Female.

 SEX: Z// F  Female, 21 and over
 BIRTH DATE: JUL 1970// ^
 Do you wish to continue to the next section? YES// NO  (NO)
 Do you need to transmit this record to Austin? YES// NO  (NO)
                           &lt;  No Action Taken&gt;

 Now, Marion's entry and the entries of the Regular Hours that she worked
 can be sent to the new system.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
This patch is part of the migration from the VistA-based Voluntary
TimeKeeping package to the web-based Voluntary Service System (VSS).
It is a patch for ABSV*4.0*31.  It will add the missing Service Codes,
170A and 270A-E.  It also excludes data from any Game site; stations
700, 701, 702,and 575W.  For consolidated stations, the user will be
prompted to send or not send data for each site.  This will allow them 
to exclude Voluntary Time Keeping data for old site numbers. 

 
This patch installs routines, other components, and file 503339.5
VOLUNTARY MIGRATION LOG. These are all updates, originally installed
with patch ABSV*4.0*31, and will allow the site to check existing
VTK data, and to print error reports of the data validation.

After installing this patch, you need to re-run the 'Prepare for Transition
 to VSS' option under the 'Voluntary Data Migration Menu'.
 
A companion patch, ABSV*4.0*32, contains the option that sends the data to
the new system.
