<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 During the New Clinic Visits option, some QUASAR users may see an 
 additional prompt while entering the DIAGNOSTIC CODE(s). This 
 additional prompt is Select DIAGNOSTIC CONDITION. The prompt 
 occurs after the diagnostic code has been entered into the A&amp;SP 
 CLINIC VISIT file (#509850.6) and while the A&amp;SP PATIENT file's 
 (#509850.2) diagnostic condition multiple (patient diagnostic 
 history) is being updated.
 
 Why do some QUASAR users see this additional prompt, while 
 others do not? Recent FileMan patches clean up the utilities 
 for creating and entering data in sub-files (FILE^DICN  and DIE).
 We believe the QUASAR problem shows up after the FM patches are 
 installed.
  
 The legacy QUASAR code used old methodology for this call and 
 needed to be updated. Patch ACKQ*2*3 corrects this problem.
  
 What is the impact of this bug on QUASAR data? Depending on how 
 the Select DIAGNOSTIC CONDITION prompt is answered, the patient 
 diagnostic history in the A&amp;SP PATIENT file (#509850.2) may not 
 be complete. It is advisable to use the Inquire - A&amp;SP Patient 
 option to update the diagnostic history.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 When a C&amp;P exam is adequated in QUASAR, the results are 
 transmitted to the AMIE C&amp;P software. If the transmission 
 attempt to AMIE fails and the data is not successfully sent, 
 QUASAR currently does not leave the visit in a "signed off on, 
 but not adequated" state. This patch corrects this problem by 
 leaving the visit in a "signed off on, but not adequated" state 
 so that re-transmission can take place.

The Audiometric module was developed in conjunction
with the Remote Order Entry System (ROES 3.0) at the VA Denver
Distribution Center. [Prior ROES 2 VistA applications may be run
concurrently with the new system during the switchover]
This patch includes two new options. These two options are only
 available in the Windows environment. Please refer to the 
Installation Guide for instructions on setting these options up.
 
The 2 new GUI options are:
 
(1) [ACKQROES3E] Enter or edit the data into file 509850.9. When
     signed, this transmits the data to the DDC for use with ROES 3
     Custom Hearing Aid orders.
 
(2) [ACKQROES3] View the audiogram generated from that data and
    print VA form 10-2364.

This patch contains the following enhancements:
==============================================
 
The Audiometric Exam Module (ACKQ*3.0*3) provides new
functionality for ASPS, to simplify and enhance the entry, display
and use of information obtained during the Audiometric exam of
a patient.  This module is comprised of two distinct application
functions: Audiogram Edit function and the Audiogram Display
function.
  
Records are stored in a local QUASAR global (#509850.9).
When signed they are also transmitted from this application to the
Denver Distribution Center (DDC) through the VistA MailMan system
for inclusion with orders for hearing aids and repairs when
ordered through the VistA Remote Order Entry System (ROES)
package.
  
The 'Audiogram Edit' function is a Windows based software
application that allows clinicians to enter, edit or view the
audiometric exam information from the Computerized Patient
Record System (CPRS) Tools menu.  Using this function, a new
audiogram record can be entered, or an existing one can be edited.
 Once signed, the edited data can only be viewed.
  
The 'Audiogram Display' function is a Windows based software
application that allows clinicians to view a patient's audiogram
from the CPRS Tools menu.  It can also be called from the 
Audiogram Edit application, if they exist in the same directory
and folder. This function presents the clinical information in a
standard format recognized within the hearing industry. The user
has a choice of viewing just the last audiogram, or the last two
in the file.

Installation Instructions:
=========================
  
This patch was created with Kernel V8 KIDS.
  
1. This is a completely new installation, so it will not affect
   any current ROES 3 users or others on the system. You do not
   need to restrict users from signing on or lock any options.
  
2. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.
   This option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
3. You DO NOT need to stop Taskman or the background filers. None
   of the routines require mapping, so mapping does not need to be
   disabled.
 
4. Using the Kernel Installation and Distribution System menu
   (KIDS), you may choose the following options prior to 
   installing this patch:
  
   a) All routines are new, so there should be no need to Backup
      the Transport Global.
  
   b) Again, this is an all new module, so there should be no
      need to Compare Transport Global to the Current System.
  
   c) Verify Checksums in the Transport Global. This option will
      allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
      in the transport global.
  
5. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation'
   menu. Installation should only take a few minutes.
  
   a) Select INSTALL NAME: ACKQ*3.0*3
 
   b) When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon
      Completion of Install?' YES// respond "NO"
  
   c) When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the 
      install?' YES// respond "NO".
 
   d) When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu
      Option and Protocols?' NO// respond "NO".
 
   e) When prompted 'Want to MOVE routines to other CPUs?' YES//
      respond "NO".
  
6. Unzip the Audiogram.zip file containing the executables
   ACKQROES3.EXE and ACKQROES3E.EXE onto the network. They must
   reside in the same directory in order for the practitioner to
   view the audiogram display(ACKQROES3) from the audiogram edit
   program (ACKQROES3E). [An alternative is to place the
   executables on each client computer, referencing it in the
   application path of the CPRS Tools menu.]
  
7. Assign Broker options ACKQROES3 and ACKQROES3E to selected ASPS
   staff members. This will provide access to the options and
   allow them to startup successfully when the user logs in.
  
8. Add the ACKQROES3 and ACKQROES3E applications to the CPRS Tools
   menu. [See the separate installation guide for further
   instructions.]

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
This patch addresses several issues that came up at the VAMC stations as
a result of the initial release of the Audiometric Exam Module (patch
ACKQ*3.0*3). These changes have been made to the GUI(Windows based)
Enter/Edit(ACKQROES3E.EXE) and Display(ACKQROES3.EXE) applications in the
package for both the CPRS Toolbar and Desktop versions, as well as to the
VistA part of the application. The VistA part includes the file data
dictionary, Remote Procedure Calls and routines.
 
The Audiometric Exam Module was developed in conjunction with the Remote
Order Entry System (ROES 3.0) at the VA Denver Distribution Center(DDC)
and is only available to run in the Windows environment. The application
can be installed completely from this patch, if ACKQ*3.0*3 was not
installed. Users are encouraged to consult the full Installation Guide
referenced below if AKCQ*3.0*3 was not installed. If ACKQ*3.0*3 was 
 
installed, then installing the KIDS build and copying the new executables 
 
over the original executables of the same name will complete
the install.

 Overview of Remedy ticket(s):
 ----------------------------
 Problem: When a user without context accessed the Edit Module, they were
 allowed to enter the application and view the screens. They were not able
 to actually edit the data.
 
 Solution: The application [ACKQROES3E.EXE] was modified to exit and halt
 the application if the user did not have the appropriate VistA
 application assigned to create context.
 
 Associated Remedy Ticket: HD000000063808
 
 
 
 -----
 Problem: Sites encountered a Null Subscript at EN2+4^ACKQAG02 when
 entering a new record and cancels out of entering the date and time of
 the exam.
 
 Solution: A fix is applied in routine ACKQAG02 and in the record setup
 to give the appropriate error message and exit the application if a valid
 date and time are not entered.
 
 Associated Remedy Tickets: HD000000063675 and HD000000063875
 
 -----
 Problem: Some error messages or message prompts were coming up behind
 other screens. The only way for them to show up was to select the
 application from the bottom task bar.
 
 Solution: Most of the messages in the Audiogram Edit application are now
 enclosed in code to send them to topmost position and after the message
 ends, to restore the previous topmost setup.  This may not be a complete
 solution, but available documentation indicates it should help, if not
 eliminate the problem from this application.

This patch contains the following enhancements:
===============================================
 
The Audiometric Exam Module provided new functionality for Audiology and
Speech Pathology Services(ASPS), to simplify and enhance the entry,
display and use of information obtained during the Audiometric exam of a
patient. This module is comprised of two distinct application functions:
        Audiogram Edit function [ACKQROES3E.EXE]
        Audiogram Display function [ACKQROES3.EXE]
 
Records are stored in the local AUDIOMETRIC EXAM file (^ACK(509850.9).
When signed, the records are also transmitted from this global to the DDC
through the VistA Mailman system. At the DDC, data from these records is
included with orders for hearing aids and repairs when the orders are
placed through the VistA Remote Order Entry System (ROES) package.
They may also be viewed remotely from the ROES Patient Information screen
of the ROES web application.
 
ACKQ*3.0*12 implements the following changes:
 
 1. Removal of Buttons
 In both audiogram GUI applications, the buttons previously on the screens
 have been replaced by menu options at the top of the form.
 
 2. Loop to Another Patient or Record
 In both applications, a menu option (Get New Record) has been added to
 allow the user to go to another record without exiting the application.
 If accessing through CPRS, record selection is limited to the current
 patient. From the Desktop application, users may select another patient
 or go to another record for the same patient.
 
 3. Comments
 A comment box has been added to the Edit application where the clinician
 can enter up to 300 characters of text. A checkbox has been inserted
 directly above the comment area for use if the clinician would like to
 automatically insert the words "NOT ADEQUATE FOR RATING PURPOSES". This
 text will be saved to the file and will be imported into VA form 10-2364.
 
 4. Update VA form 10-2364
 VA form 10 2364 has been modified to reflect the changes made to the form
 since the release of patch ACKQ*3.0*3. The comment section of the form is
 no longer editable.
 
 5. Color Changes
 Color has been removed from the data entry boxes. This allows for a
 cleaner presentation and makes more of the screen available for the edit
 boxes.
 
 6. Retransmit Audiogram
 In the Edit application, a menu option has been added to allow
 retransmission of a signed audiogram.  This is necessary to transfer the
 speech, word and other readings that were not a part of the original
 transmission.
 
 7. Removing Audiogram
 In the Edit application, a menu option has been added to allow deletion
 of a signed audiogram. This became necessary because, in their haste to
 enter audiograms under heavy workload pressures, users sometimes entered
 audiograms under the wrong patient and the error was not discovered until
 after transmission. This would then become a problem when data would be
 on duplicate systems for the wrong patient. After installing this patch,
 when a local signed audiogram is deleted, a message with identifying
 information is sent to the DDC to delete the record there also.
 Clinicians should use utmost caution in both entering and removing
 audiograms.
 
 8. File Changes
 Numerous fields were added to the AUDIOMETRIC EXAM file to provide the
 additional data needed for diagnostic and reporting purposes. The data
 type of many fields was changed at the request of the national program
 office to more efficiently handle the text and tags required in the
 fields. Many that were numeric are now free text. Refer to the
 CHANGES/ADDITIONS TO FILE section for more detailed information.
 
 9. New Fields on Edit Pages
 The new editable fields (bullet 8) and data type screening were added to
 the Edit program.
 
 10. Masking Change
 Masking is no longer referenced in the fields with an '*', but will
 instead be indicated by a non-zero numeric value in the 'Masking Level'
 field. Prior instances of the data without a masking level will continue
 to display the '*' sign.
 
 11. No Response Change
 The symbol for 'No Response'(+) will now be stored in the text field with
 the numeric value.
 
 12. No Testing, No Masking
 'CNM', 'CNT', 'DNT' and 'FLAT; are now accommodated in the appropriate
 text fields in the file as well as in the Edit program.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 
 Installation of this patch will take about 5 minutes. Additional
 time will be needed if the GUI applications have been installed on
 individual client machines or the location of the applications on the
 network has changed. Users need not be off the system when applying this
 patch, but it should be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 disruption to users.
 
  1. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
     options as desired:
        Print Transport Global
        Compare Transport Global to Current System
        Verify Checksums in Transport Global
        Backup a Transport Global
 
  2. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
     option to install the patch:
        Install Package(s) (ACKQ*3.0*12)
 
  3. When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? YES//", respond 'NO'.
 
  4. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond 'NO'.
 
  5. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//', respond 'YES'.
     Options to disable:
        ACKQROES3
        ACKQROES3E
 
  6. When prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//; respond '0'.
 
  7. Following the installation of the KIDS build, the system will
     immediately run routine ACKQAG08. This will move any existing
     'No Response' or 'Masked' tags into the appropriate threshold fields.
 
  8. At this point the two revised executables (ACKQROES3.EXE and
     ACKQROES3E.EXE) should be copied over all existing copies on the
     network or client machine. Add the VistA menu options for any new
     application users and setup on their CPRS Toolbar as necessary, as
     detailed in the INSTALLATION GUIDE.
 
  9. We do not anticipate any need to reinstall this patch. However, it
     may be reinstalled if necessary.
