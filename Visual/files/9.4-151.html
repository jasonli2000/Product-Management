<dt>DESCRIPTION OF ENHANCEMENTS:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The Event Capture module provides a mechanism to track and account for
patient workload performed that is not recorded in any existing DHCP
package.  These procedures and services are associated with the patient
to whom they were delivered, the provider rendering the service or
procedure, and the workload unit responsible for delivering the service.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1996-09-26 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
  This patch corrects several miscellaneous data entry problems that
  have been identified.
 
  Problem 1.
  NOIS #OKL-0596-72092 reported an &lt;UNDEF&gt; error at SELC+1^ECBEN2A.
  The variable EC1 was undefined.  All data entry options have been
  reviewed to ensure that the variable EC1 is defined.
 
  Problem 2.
  NOIS #LON-0596-61759 reported a duplicate screen display when using
  the "Batch Data Entry by Patient" or "Data Entry (Batch) by Procedure"
  options.  After selecting a procedure, from the listing of available
  procedures, the procedure name is echoed back plus printing the name
  two additional times.  The additional printing of the procedure names
  has been eliminated.
 
  Problem 3.
  NOIS #LON-0596-61762 reported that when using the "Batch Data Entry
  by Patient", if an "^" is entered at the prompt "Is this information
  correct?" the user is not exited from the option.  The user is then
  prompted to "Select Next Patient".  If a patient is selected the list of
  selected patients is numbered incorrectly.  Now when an "^" is entered
  at "Is this information correct?" a screen displayed alerting the user
  that "**NOTE**  No action taken. You must  re-enter the correct patient
  and procedure data that has NOT been filed during this session. ".  The
  user is then prompted to "Select Patient".
 
  Problem 4.
  After confirming a category using the "Local Category (Enter/Edit)"
  option the screen will display "??".  The option correctly updated the
  category name but was not updating the date created information when 
  the category was initially entered.
 
  Problem 5.
  NOIS STC-0696-40797 reported when creating an Event Code Screen the
  user is prompted with "Is the following information correct? YES// "
  when the data is listed previously on the screen.  The display
  message has been changed to read "Is this information correct? YES// ".
 
  Problem 6.
  The routines ECED and ECDSSYN killed the variable ^TMP("ECPRO")
  incorrectly.  The correct method killing ^TMP("ECPRO",$J) has
  been inserted.  This will prevent procedure lists from being
  deleted by mistake.
 
  Problem 7.
  When using the data entry options and selecting a procedure from
  the listing displayed, an &lt;UNDEF&gt; error could occur if "01" was
  entered instead of "1".  This error has been corrected.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
*** Patient Care Encounter (PCE) Version 1.0 should be installed 
    before installing this patch.  
 
Three patches are required before installing this patch.  Event
Capture patches EC*2*1, EC*2*2, and KERNEL patch XU*8*44.  
 
This patch will impact the DSS Extracts ECS Feeder Key report
and the ECS extract.  A DSS Extracts patch, ECX*2*23, is currently
under development that addresses the ECS feeder keys for FY97 and
the ECS extract fix.  Targeted release date for patch ECX*2*23
is May 10, 1997.
 
NOTE:  Your site should NOT run the ECS extract, after installing
EC*2*4, until the DSS Extracts patch ECX*2*23 is released and
installed on your system.  Any ECS extract your site generated
prior to installing EC*2*4 is not affected. The ECS extract will only
be impacted AFTER EC*2*4 is installed.
 
 
This patch implements new functionality in the Event
Capture (EC) package to allow the non-interactive filing of
the EC system workload data to the Patient Care Encounter
(PCE) software.  By utilizing this EC to PCE filing process,
the need for duplicate data entry into both packages diminishes
while supporting the transmission of workload data to
nationally supported databases.  Outpatient data entered into
EC, passed through PCE, updates the National Patient Care
Database (NPCBD) at the Austin Automation Center (AAC).  All
data entered into EC is passed to the Decision Support System
(DSS) at the AAC using the VISTA DSS Extracts software.
 
This is a mandatory patch and MUST be installed.  If your site does
not anticipate sending Event Capture data to PCE, this patch still
MUST be installed.  The only difference your users will see is both
DATE and TIME are now required to enter workload data into Event
Capture.  They will never see the additional prompts required for
the filing of data to PCE.
 
 
Three NOIS messages are addressed in this patch.  The AMIS Reports
are modified to correct the problems reported in the following NOIS: 
 
 ATG-1196-30490 AMIS Report Producing Incorrect Totals 
 LON-0896-60887 AMIS Summary - Dropping Procedure 
 BRX-0297-11162 Original Default Volume 
 
 
The data dictionary changes made by this patch are listed below,
followed by a summary of the PCE filing process and patch
installation instructions.  
EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE file (#725): A new field called CPT
(field #4) is added which should be edited for each local
procedure entry that sends workload data to PCE.  A Current
Procedural Terminology (CPT) code is required to pass EC
procedural data to PCE.  Only the local EC procedures
representing workload that your sites wants sent to PCE
require an associated CPT code.  The option Local Procedure
(Enter/Edit) [ECDSS PROCEDURE] is modified for users to edit
this field for local procedures and is exported as part of the
Event Capture Management Menu [ECMGR].
 
Many new nationally defined procedures added in this patch
include Speech Pathology  and Blood Bank.  Products for Social
Work and Chaplain service have been completely redefined.  A
generic CPT code is associated with each existing active
national procedure entry.  Use the National/Local Procedure
Reports [ECDSS1] option on the Management Reports [ECDSRPT] menu
to review the new and updated entries in this file.   
 
 Field 4 - CPT 
  The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code equivalent for this 
  national or local procedure.  Each EC recognized procedure must 
  have an associated CPT code for filing with PCE.  
 
DSS UNIT file (#724): The DATA ENTRY DATE/TIME DEFAULT field
(#11) is modified to accept N for NOW or X for NONE as a date/time
default.  T for TODAY is no longer a valid date/time default.
All existing DSS Units using T for TODAY will be updated to use
N for NOW during the installation process.
 
One new field, SEND TO PCE (field #13), is added which must
be edited in order to activate the filing process. The option
DSS Units for Event Capture (Enter/Edit) [ECSECT] is modified
to edit these fields and is exported with the Event Capture
Management Menu [ECMGR].
 
 Field 13 -  SEND TO PCE 
  This field controls the method of sending data, by DSS Unit, to the 
  PCE software.  If this field contains an O, only outpatient data, for 
  this DSS Unit, will be filed with PCE.  If the field contains an A, 
  all records, for this DSS Unit, can be filed with PCE.  If the field 
  contains an N or is null, no filing will occur.  This field is exported 
  null.  
 
EC EVENT CODE SCREENS FILE (#720.3): This file contains a single new field
that allows the site to associate a clinic with an event code screen.
This field is described below.
 
 Field 55 - ASSOCIATED CLINIC
  This field will indicate the default clinic associated with workload 
  performed by this event code screen.  This clinic will be used as the
  hospital location for the EC system workload records for PCE filing
  purposes.  This clinic will also be the source for the stop code
  (DSS ID) needed by PCE.  This field should be edited for each event
  code screen that will send to PCE.  The clinic associated with the
  event code screen will be displayed to users during the data entry
  processes.
 
EVENT CAPTURE PATIENT file (#721): The DATE/TIME OF PROCEDURE field
(#2) is modified to require time for every record entered.  New
fields which have been added to this file are described below.
The data entry options Enter/Edit Patient Procedures [ECPAT],
Batch Enter Data by Patient [ECBATCH], and Data Entry (Batch) by
Procedure [ECBATCH PROC] are modified to ask users these questions
or update the fields automatically when appropriate.  
 
 Field 19 - PCE CPT CODE 
  The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code for the patient 
  procedure performed.  
 
 Field 20 - ICD-9 CODE 
  The ICD-9 (diagnosis) for the procedure performed.  This data 
  element is required for all workload records.  
 
 Field 21 - AGENT ORANGE 
  This field will be used to indicate if this procedure is treating 
  a VA patient for a problem that is related to Agent Orange Exposure.
  Data is Y if this patient was exposed to agent orange, N if not, 
  or U if unknown.  
 
 Field 22 - RADIATION EXPOSURE 
  This field will be used to indicate if this procedure is treating 
  a VA patient for a problem that is related to Ionizing Radiation 
  Exposure.  Data is Y if this patient claims exposure to ionizing 
  radiation, N if not, or U if unknown.  
 
 Field 23 - ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS 
  This field will be used to indicate if this procedure is treating 
  a VA patient for a problem that is related to Environmental 
  Contaminant Exposure.  Data is Y if this patient claims exposure 
  to environmental contaminants, N if not, or U if unknown.  
 
 Field 24 - SERVICE CONNECTED 
  This field will be used to indicate if this procedure is treating 
  a VA patient for a service connected problem.  Data is Y if this 
  patient is service connected or N if not service connected for this  
  treatment.
 
 Field 25 - SENT TO PCE 
  This field flags data that has been sent from Event Capture to PCE.
 
 Field 26 - ASSOCIATED CLINIC 
  This is the clinic associated with this record.  
 
 Field 27 - DSS ID 
  The DSS ID, formerly stop code, associated with this patient record.
 
 Field 28 - VISIT 
  This is the visit associated with this patient procedure.  This
  field is a pointer to the VISIT file (#9000010).
 
 Field 29 -IN/OUTPATIENT 
  The status of the patient when this event occurred. The code "I" 
  represents an inpatient event or an "O" represents an outpatient 
  event occurred.  
 
 Field 30 - PCE DATA FEED 
  The field contains the EC data formatted to feed the Patient Care 
  Encounter (PCE) software.  
 
 Field 31 - SEND TO PCE 
  This flag controls the EC system data that is ready to send to PCE.  
  If this record should be sent to PCE, this flag will be set with a 
  date. 
 
 Field 32 - CHECKOUT D/T 
  This field contains the checkout date and time of this procedure.  
  The checkout date and time is generated when the nightly background 
  job is run.  
 
 Field 33 - REASON
  This field contains the reasons why this patient record was
  not sent to the Patient Care Encounter (PCE) software.  This
  field is automatically populated during the PCE filing
  process.
 
NEW CROSS REFERENCES:   This patch includes a new MUMPS cross reference
in the EVENT CAPTURE PATIENT file (#721).  The AD cross reference on the
SEND TO PCE field (#31) controls the filing of the data that is ready
for PCE.  
 
NEW OPTIONS:  This patch adds two new options to collect, maintain, and
report the data filing to PCE.  
 
 Nightly Data Feed to PCE [EC NIGHT] 
  This option controls the routine that sends Event Capture data 
  to Patient Care Encounter (PCE) software nightly.  The EC system 
  data is stored in the EVENT CAPTURE PATIENT file (#721).  EC data 
  that has been flagged to send to PCE will be picked and sent when 
  this routine is run. This routine should run nightly, therefore 
  the rescheduling frequency is 1D.  The time to queue this option 
  to run should not conflict with system backup.  
 
 PCE Data Summary [ECPCER] 
  This option is exported on the Event Capture Reports [ECREPS] menu.  
  This Event Capture data summary lists, by patient, key information 
  that has been sent to the Patient Care Encounter (PCE) software.  
  The date and time of the procedure, procedure name listed in PCE, 
  volume of procedures sent, CPT and ICD-9 codes, associated clinic 
  and DSS ID (formerly stop code), and the provider of care are listed 
  on this report.  
 
HELP FRAMES:  The following help frame is created.  
 
ECPCER 
  This Event Capture data summary lists, by patient, key information 
  that has been sent to the Patient Care Encounter (PCE) software.  
  The date and time of the procedure, procedure name listed in PCE, 
  volume of procedures sent, CPT and ICD-9 codes, associated clinic 
  and DSS ID (formerly stop code), and the provider of care are listed 
  on this report.  
 
SUMMARY OF THE PCE FILING PROCESS: 
 
Each DSS Unit should be edited to update the SEND TO PCE information.
If a DSS Unit is marked to send data to PCE, then when creating new
event code screens within this DSS Unit or editing existing event
code screens defined within this DSS Unit, a new prompt for an
ASSOCIATED CLINIC is displayed.
 
An associated clinic should be defined for each event code screen
defined for DSS Units marked to send data to PCE.  For entering new
event code screens, use the Event Code Screens (Create) [ECSCREEN]
option. For existing event code screens, use the Procedure
Synonym/Default Volume (Enter/Edit) [ECDSSYN] option.  These
associated clinics will be displayed to users during data entry
processes.  
 
The data entry options Enter/Edit Patient Procedures [ECPAT],
Batch Enter Data by Patient [ECBATCH], and Data Entry (Batch)
by Procedure [ECBATCH PROC] are updated to ask users the PCE
required prompts.  The DATE/TIME OF PROCEDURE field (#2) now
requires time as part of every procedure date.  Each patient
record entered must include a diagnosis code (ICD-9), an
inpatient/outpatient indicator, and an active clinic.  Users
manually entering this data must answer diagnosis, determine an
inpatient or outpatient status, and accept the default clinic
or select an active clinic.  If it is an outpatient encounter,
users are also prompted to answer agent orange exposure,
ionizing radiation exposure, environmental contaminants exposure,
and related service connection.  
 
After the PCE prompts are answered, all appropriate patient
records are formatted to file the data with PCE.  This formatted
data string is stored in the PCE DATA FEED field (#30).  The
flag to file this record is then set in the SEND TO PCE field
(#31).  These fields exist in the EVENT CAPTURE PATIENT file
(#721).  The nightly scheduled Nightly Data Feed to PCE [EC NIGHT]
option will file the data with PCE and store a pointer to the
corresponding visit created in the VISIT file (#9000010).
Patient data records that have been filed with PCE and are
later edited or deleted in the EC system will automatically
send an update to PCE. For those records that should be filed
to PCE but are not sent due to missing or incorrect data will
store a reason in the REASON file (#33).
