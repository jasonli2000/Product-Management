<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses undefined variable errors in the Equipment/Turn-In 
Request package.  The following NOIS are addreessed by this patch.

1.             REN-0497-60517

When a priority is placed on a new equipment request by a CMR Official and 
the request is sent to PPM for review, during the review process PPM will 
answer NO to the IS THIS NX EQUIPMENT prompt, they then enter a reason why 
this is not NX equipment.  Immediately following this, an undefined error 
occurs.

2.             NAS-0697-31502

When a request for replacement equipment is edited and the quantity is 
increased the user is asked to enter the replacement equipment for the line 
item they choose, after the item is entered the program fails with an 
undefined variable.

3.             MEM-0697-70758

When a request is sent to Engineering and the request is updated to include 
training, a vendor must be entered into the ENG. TRAINING VENDOR (#55) 
field, when this is done the program attempts to find that vendor in the 
VENDOR (#440) file and stuff the pointer into the ENG TRAIN VENDOR PTR 
(#55.5) field.  The lookup was being done in the wrong file so an undefined 
error would occur each time the lookup tried to reconcile the vendor.
