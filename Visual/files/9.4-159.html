<dt>DESCRIPTION OF ENHANCEMENTS:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This KIDS distribution contains Statistical Analysis of Global Growth
(SAGG) version 1.8.  This version of SAGG can be installed over any
previous versions of SAGG without any adverse problems.
 
All DSM, MSM and OpenM-NT sites are instructed to install this
distribution.  Sites which had a pre-release of SAGG v 1.8 should also
install this distribution.
 
This distribution is dependent on the previous installation of Kernel
Patch XU*8.0*90.  If this distribution detects that the patch is not
installed at your site, the installation process will stop.  If this
occurs, you will need to obtain and install Kernel Patch XU*8.0*90 and
then you may begin the installation of this product.  The SAGG Project 
v 1.8 package will utilize the %ZOSVKS-namespace routines that were
installed with Kernel Patch XU*8.0*90.
 
This distribution will move SAGG from the A1B5 namespace into the KMPS
namespace.  The data within the old SAGG PROJECT file (#11120) will be
moved into new SAGG PROJECT file (#8970.1).  The old file, routines,
options and mail group will be deleted.
 
The 'SAGG Project Manager' menu [KMPS SAGG MANAGER] will be added to the
'Capacity Management' [XTCM MAIN] menu.

Subject:  Collect Disk Capacity Information
 
Category:
  - Routine
 
Description:
============
 
This patch is being released by Capacity Management (CM) to allow
the Statistical Analysis of Global Growth (SAGG) Version 1.8 software
package to collect disk capacity information from the sites.
 
All DSM, MSM and OpenM-NT sites are instructed to install this patch.
 
This patch, in conjunction with Kernel patch XU*8*121, will support the
collection of disk capacity information from the following operating
system platforms: DSM and OpenM-NT.
 
 
Installation:
=============
 
Provided that the 'SAGG Master Background Task' [KMPS SAGG REPORT] is not
currently running, this installation can be performed at any time of the
day with minimal disruption to users.  Installation should not take longer
than 10-15 minutes.
 
   1.  DSM and MSM sites - You will need to diable any routines within 
       the KMPS* namespace.
 
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
 
   3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
          
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
                                   
   4.  As this install only affects the SAGG Master Background Task, you
       do not have to inhibit users from login into the system.
       
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 'Install
       Package(s)' option and select the package KMPS*1.8*1.
                                                 ==========
       
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', you can respond with NO.
       
   7.  DSM and MSM sites - after the patch has installed, rebuild your map
       set if necessary.
       
       The KMPS* namespaced routines are NOT recommended to be mapped.

Description: 
============
 
This patch is being released by Capacity Management (CM) to correct the
'Invalid reverse-path specification' transmission error within the
Statistical Analysis of Global Growth (SAGG) Version 1.8 software package.
This patch release will also allow the collection routines to run on Cache
for OpenVMS platforms.
 
All DSM, Cache for Windows NT and Cache for OpenVMS sites are instructed
to install this patch.
 
The original 'Status of SAGG Collection Routines' [KMPS SAGG STATUS] 
option has been renamed as the 'Check SAGG Environment' option.  In 
addition to providing the previous information regarding the SAGG 
collection routines, this option will now check the status of SAGG patch 
installation at the site.
 
The local mail message that is generated when the the SAGG background 
routines complete their collection process has been enhanced to 
accommodate the expanded volume set names found on the Cache for OpenVMS 
and Cache for Windows NT platforms.  In addition, the local message will
recommend that the background job be run over the weekend hours if the job
is started during the weekday.
 
The pre-install routine of this patch will move mail members from the
KMPS-SAGG mail group to the KMP-CAPMAN mail group.  The KMP-CAPMAN
mail-group was created with the release of the Resource Usage Monitor
(RUM) package.  All SAGG notification messages will start utilizing the
KMP-CAPMAN mail group.  Any mail groups within the MAIL GROUP file that
have KMPS-SAGG as a MEMBER GROUP will have the KMPS-SAGG entry removed.
 
This patch will remove the KMPS-SAGG mail group from the MAIL GROUP file.
The 'Edit KMPS-SAGG Mail Group' [KMPS SAGG MAIL] option will be deleted.
Use the 'Capacity Management Mail Group Edit' [KMP MAIL GROUP EDIT] option
to change the the membership of the mail group that will receive package
notification messages.
 
This patch will now allow SAGG to accept alphanumeric characters within 
the site number.  This problem had effected the MPI facility located in
Austin.
 
This patch will enable the collection of hardware information from sites
running DSM.  The hardware information will consist of the hardware name 
(such as Compaq AlphaServer ES40) and the number of active cpu processors 
installed within each node.

Installation Steps:
===================
 
Provided that the 'SAGG Master Background Task' [KMPS SAGG REPORT] is not 
currently running, this installation can be performed at any time of the day
with minimal disruption to users.  Installation should not take longer than
10-15 minutes.  
 
   1.  Review the mail members of the KMPS-SAGG and KMP-CAPMAN mail groups
       with the FileMan Inquiry option. A pre-install routine will attempt
       to move mail members from the KMPS-SAGG mail group to the 
       KMP-CAPMAN mail group.
       
       Any mail members that are not automatically moved will need to be 
       entered manually with FileMan into the KMP-CAPMAN mail group after
       completion of the patch installation process.
       
       The patch will delete the KMPS-SAGG mail group during the patch 
       installation process.
 
   2.  DSM sites - You will need to disable any routines within the KMPS*
       namespace.  
 
   3.  Download the KIDS file KMPS1_8_2.KID from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
       directory of either Albany, Hines or the Salt Lake OIFO to the
       appropriate directory on your system.
       
   4.  Use 'Load a Distribution' option on the KIDS 'Installation' menu,
       and enter: KMPS1_8_2.KID
       
       Provide the necessary directory path to the file if needed.
       
   5.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your 
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following 
       options: 
          
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
          Print Transport Global 
          Compare Transport Global to Current System 
          Backup a Transport Global 
                                   
   6.  As this install only affects the SAGG Master Background Task, you 
       do not have to inhibit users from login into the system.  
       
   7.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 'Install 
       Package(s)' option and select the package KMPS*1.8*2.  
                                                 ==========
       
   8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', you can respond with NO.  
       
   9.  DSM sites - after the patch has installed, rebuild your map set if
       necessary.  
       
       The KMPS* namespaced routines are NOT recommended to be mapped.    
 
  10.  Review the contents of the KMP-CAPMAN mail group with the FileMan 
       Inquiry option to ensure that the members of the KMPS-SAGG mail 
       group have been properly copied.
