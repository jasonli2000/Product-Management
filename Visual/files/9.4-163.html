+ Ability to view and manipulate clinical documents from a single program
+ Upload capability for many types of documents
+ Improved searching and retrieving capabilities across documents
+ Less duplication of effort for clinicians, managers, and other staff
+ Boilerplate support
+ Links to the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), Authorization/
  Subscription Utility (ASU), Incomplete Record Tracking (IRT), and
  interfacility document transfer
 
Costs
 
+ Planning your Document and User Class hierarchies.
+ Setting up the Document hierarchy so that your current Progress Notes
  can be converted into the new TIU structure
+ Setting up and populating the User Classes (ASU)
+ Setting up the Upload Utilities and other TIU parameters
+ Converting existing progress notes and discharge summaries to TIU
+ Switching Progress Notes and Discharge Summary menus to TIU menus

Description:
===========
PATCH 1: This patch resolves a number of problems with the Remote
Procedure Calls which support CPRS, the scoping of demographic variables,
and one of the cross-references supporting the query by Service, which
have been reported since release of TIU.
 
The following routines are included in this distribution:
 
 1. Routine:   TIUDEV
               Added ZTSAVE("OR*") to the list of variables to be
               saved in the call to ^%ZTLOAD for queued output.
               This was done to prevent an UNDEF error when queuing
               output from the Notes and Summaries Tabs of the CPRS
               Chart.
 
 2. Routines:  TIUEDI2         TIUEDIT
               Modified TIUEDI2 to prevent prompting inappropriately
               for the user to edit an unsaved note, for which they
               are not listed as the person by whom the note was
               entered.  Modified TIUEDIT to assure that demographic
                variables are scoped appropriately between patients
               during successive entry of multiple TIU documents.
 
 3. Routine:   TIULA2
               - Modified the display of titles to indicate the title
                 for which an addendum has been entered, and to pre-
                 pend a "+" when a document has addenda, or a "*" when
                 a document is an unsigned "STAT" document.
               - Modified the selection code to allow multiple
                 selection at any '^' TO STOP prompt, and to support
                 the selection of an indefinite number of notes,
                 without resulting in a STRLEN error, which had been
                 reported by WPB when a range of approximately 200
                 notes was selected.
 
 4. Routine:   TIULG   WPB NOIS COS-0797-N0060
               Modified the BADSIG subroutine to print the message:
               &lt; [TITLE] SAVED - WITHOUT SIGNATURE &gt;
               when the user elects not to sign the note on exit
               from the entry or edit function, rather than echoing
               a message indicating how to enter their electronic
               signature code using the User's Toolbox option.
 
 5. Routine:   TIULX
               Modified the CWAD subroutine to assure that the
                variable GMRPQT is appropriately scoped, prior to
               calling PAT^GMRPNOR1 to get the string indicating
               which CWAD indicators were on file for the current
               patient, and setting the variable VALMBCK="R" to
               assure that the Notes and Summaries Tabs of the
               CPRS chart are properly refreshed on return from
               a call to this subroutine.
 
 6. Routine:   TIUPEFIX
               Modified the STUFREC subroutine to assure that the
               appropriate status is computed when resolving upload
               errors.
 
 7. Routine:   TIUPRD
               Modified the Print Driver to ensure that all documents
               identified in a call to the routine do exist, and are
               not merely artifacts of corrupt cross-reference entries
               left by disconnect errors, or other interrupted
               processes.
 
 8. Routine:   TIURA
               Added a NEW command at the line tag PRINTX to scope
               the variable IOSTBM appropriately, and allow printing
               of documents to VA FileMan's Browser device.
 
 9. Routine:   TIURC
               Fixed the COPY function to assure that the appropriate
               visit location was being recorded for the "destination"
               note, rather than copying the visit location from the
               "source" note.
 
10. Routine:   TIURD1
               Modified to resolve a number of issues with reassign-
               ment of addenda (particularly following signature),
               including the scrambling of signature blocks when
               addenda were swapped with, or moved to replace their
               originals.
 
11. Routines:  TIUSRV          TIUSRVD
               TIUSRVLL        TIUSRVLO
               TIUSRVP
               These routines, which primarily support TIU's Remote
               Procedure Calls, were modified to fix several issues
               that were identified during implementation of CPRS
               v1.0T12 at WPB, as follows:
               - TIUSRV: the variable VALMAR needed to be scoped
                 using the NEW command to avoid collision with the
                 variable's value in the calling environment,
               - TIUSRVD: the variables VAIN and VADM were scoped
                 using the NEW command to avoid leaving demographic
                 and inpatient variables around between successive
                 patients. The subroutine TRAVERSE was modified to
                 filter inactive titles from the list when composing
                 a new note using the CPRS GUI.
               - TIUSRVLL: Added a condition to assure that UNSIGNED
                 addenda are included in the list of notes presented
                 to an author using the Review Progress Notes option.
               - TIUSRVLO: Modified date limit computation to assure
                 that both upper and lower bounds are inclusive (e.g.,
                 from TODAY to TODAY will get all of today's notes),
                 when accessed through CPRS (this was already true
                 within TIU itself).
               - TIUSRVP: Modified the VALIDATE function for evaluating
                 electronic signatures passed from a client application
                 to exclude a match when the user's es is NULL, and the
                 string passed from the calling application is NULL.

Data Dictionary: 
===============
This patch also exports a partial DD for the .01 field of file 8925,
with a correction to the KILL LOGIC for the ASVC2 Cross-reference on
that field.
 
 
Input Templates:
===============
The input templates TIU ENTER/EDIT PROGRESS NOTE and TIUZ ENTER/EDIT
PN were modified to allow editing of expected cosigner, whenever one
may have been designated.  These templates formerly only asked for
expected cosigner when the author was known to require one.  This
prohibited editing of mis-designated cosigners for notes that were
captured through the upload process.  
 
 
Installation Instructions: 
==========================
This patch may be installed with users on the system; however, it
should be installed at a non-peak time to minimize disruption to
the users. Installation of this patch will take less than 2 minutes.  
   
1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the Packman Menu.  
  
2. Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in this 
   patch are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set at 
   this time, along with TIUXRC* and TIUEPN*, which include the
   code for compiled cross-references and input template effected
   by this patch.  
   
3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, 
   select the Installation menu.  
   
4. From the Installation menu, you may elect to use the following 
   options (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter TIU*1.0*1): 
   a.  Backup a Transport Global 
   b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System 
   c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
   
5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package TIU*1.0*1.
  
6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
   Protocols? YES//', respond YES, and DISABLE the TIU* Options and
   Protocols.
  
7. If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned 
   to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.

PATCH 3: This patch fixes a number of problems with the batch upload
facilities of TIU, including the alerts and options for filing error
resolution. It also fixes a discrepancy in the estimated time to
completion computed by the Progress Notes conversion.
 
The following routines are included in this distribution:
 
 1. Routine:   TIUADD
               Changed line ADDENDUM+9 to exit the subroutine when
               the user isn't authorized to add an addendum to the
               selected record. This is the appropriate behavior, and
               will also prevent a rare UNDEF error at ADDENDUM+17^TIUADD
               that had been observed at several test sites.
 
 2. Routine:   TIUCHLP
               Modified the GETPAT and GETPN subroutines to accom-
               modate the changes to the filing error resolution
               approach for BOTH the alerts and the option to
               Review Upload Filing Events.
 
 3. Routine:   TIULC
               Changed line REQVER+2 to recognize when the requirement
               for verification has been satisfied for a given record,
               and not impose the requirement inappropriately. Coincides
               with changes to TIUT to assure that the release logic, and
               signature alerts are always executed appropriately.
 
 4. Routine:   TIULC1
               Added a function POSTSIGN, to identify the Post-signature
               action for a given document definition, and enforce its
               inheritance.
 
 5. Routine:   TIUMOVE                              NOIS: PUG-0997-50895
               Modified the MAIN subroutine to prevent an error reported
               by Puget Sound and Central Texas, where repetitive upload
               of single documents through the option for direct entry of
               a Discharge Summary was occasionally resulting in a mis-
               match to the patient.
 
 6. Routine:   TIUPEVNT                             NOIS: PUG-0997-50895
               Modified to help assure that changes to TIUMOVE are
               reflected appropriately in the handling of upload filer
               errors.
 
 7. Routine:   TIUPNCV7
               Modified the SETVAR subroutine to correct the
               computation of estimated time remaining.
 
 8. Routine:   TIUPUTC
               Modified the GETREC subroutine to prevent a
               &lt;NULLSUBSCR&gt; error when a caption is not associated
               with any particular field in the target file.
  
 9. Routine:   TIUPUTPN
               Modified to assure that notes that have been released from
               the DRAFT state are not overwritten when subsequent
               information is uploaded for the same title and visit (an
               addendum will be added instead).
 
10. Routine:   TIUPUTU
               Modified the CANEDIT function to exclude overwriting
               any Discharge Summary record that had proceeded beyond
               release from draft, whether the release event was
               successfully recorded or not.
 
11. Routine:   TIURE
               Modified the FILERR subroutine to accommodate the
               changes to the error resolution approach when the
               option to Review Upload Filing Events is in use.
 
12. Routine:   TIURS
               Modified the ES subroutine to prevent prompting multiply
               to "Print this Note? NO//" when an addendum is added for
               cosigner's comments. Also changed ES subroutine to respond
               appropriately when the /ES/ block elements contain a semi-
               colon, preventing a COMMAND error. Implemented the post-
               signature action supported by changes in TIULC1.
 
13. Routine:   TIUT                                  NOIS: PUG-0997-51130
               Modified the VERIFY subroutine to stuff DUZ for field
               1306 (VERIFIED BY), whereas it was stuffing DT. Also
               modified the RELEASE subroutine to assure that the release
               logic is executed when an uploaded document fails to be
               filed initially, and is subsequently filed using the
               options or alerts for filing error correction.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1998-02-27 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Changes were made to 10 Document Definition routines fixing minor errors
and closing a small loophole which permitted users to edit objects and
possibly make them ambiguous.
 
Problems fixed:
 
1.  Messages "Deleted" and "NOT Deleted" wrapped when user deleted entry
from Document Definition file.  Messages are now written on following
line.
 
2.  If user entered a name like AGE (which happens to be the abbreviation
of an object) as a new Document Definition, say, under option Sort
Document Definitions, it was not accepted.  This was to prevent entering
ambiguous objects, but was too restrictive since the user may plan to make
AGE say, a Title, in which case it doesn't create an ambiguous object. AGE
is now accepted except under option Create Objects.
 
3.  If user entered Document Definition using Fileman with name like DOB
(which happens to be the abbreviation of an object) and no other fields,
user could edit it under Basics from the Sort option, and give it type
Object.  This creates an ambiguous object (if DOB is in boilerplate text,
code doesn't know whether to use original object PATIENT DATE OF BIRTH, or
new object DOB).  User can no longer edit type of DOB to object.
 
4.  When using hidden action Print List (PL), neither P-MESSAGE nor
BROWSER worked as a device.  They work now.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This build fixes Document Definition code that gave users the erroneous
message NO OWNER when they tried to activate Titles whose boilerplate text
contained objects with no owner.  Users also received this erroneous
message when TRYing such a Title.  The problem is fixed and users now
receive the message: BAD/INACTIVE OBJECT IN BOILERPLATE TEXT.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 This patch will correct the following issues:
 If a user enters a note in Mobile Electronic Documentation, and does not 
 select a different note before exiting, in some cases the newly entered 
 note would be lost.
 
 The parameter TIU MED HSTYPE was set to accept a free text value that 
 should contain a pointer to the Health Summary type to be used with MED. 
 This was a problem, because a user had to know the Internal entry 
 number of the health summary in order to update the parameter.
 
 When certain Patient Data Objects are imported from MED notes, internal 
 data was incorrectly getting added to the note. 
 
 Mobile Electronic Documentation was calculating when to suggest 
 database compaction incorrectly. Also, when database compaction was 
 suggested, and the users clicked Yes in order to compact the database, 
 MED would get stuck in an infinite loop and hang.
 
 The Action menu, in MED is displaying on all tabs, even though it is 
 only related to the Notes tab. This can cause confusion if there is a 
 note selected on the notes tab and the user is on a different tab.
 
 When using a dialog template in MED, parent choices are grayed out. 
 When the same choices are not grayed out if viewed in CPRS.
 
 Med Install guide references the wrong Key.
 
 If a user attempted to retrieve two patients with the same names they
 would import correctly, but only one would be selectable in the patient
 selection dialog.

When a Nurse Intraoperative Report (NIR) or Anesthesia report is entered
