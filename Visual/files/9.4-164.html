 **NOTE** THIS PATCH SHOULD BE LOADED BEFORE PATCH OR*2.5*49.
 
 The PSS*1*5 patch resolves two problems with the Pharmacy Data
 Management package.  They are listed below.
 
 Problem #1:  This patch contains modifications to routine PSSJORDF.
 The procedure call START^PSSJORDF(PSJORD) is called by Consolidated
 Patient Record System (CPRS) and passes the Orderable Item internal
 entry number.
 
 This procedure call has been changed to return an additional data
 element.  The Default Schedule name for the Orderable Item is now
 returned in ^TMP("PSJSCH",$J). ^TMP("PSJSCH",$J)= DEFAULT SCHEDULE
 NAME.
 
 Problem #2:  This patch resolves a problem related to the Drug
 Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option.  In routine PSSDEE,
 modifications were made to allow the user to enter a new drug.

    located in the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7). This field is a set of
    codes that allows the user to (0) sort by order's Schedule Type and
    then Medication Names and (1) sort by order's Medication Names.
 
 3. This patch contains a minor change to the DDs in the PHARMACY PATIENT

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 Patch PSS*1*16 contains resolutions to the following issues:
 
 1.  It corrects a problem indicated in NOIS LOU-0698-40167.  In the 
     Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option, the system encountered 
     an undefined variable (DA) when a user tried to mark a drug as 
     Clozapine.  The error was detected at UD^PSSDEE; however after 
     further analysis, the culprit was really discovered in routine 
     PSSCLDRG. In routine PSSCLDRG, ASK+3,END+0, and UNMARK+1, the DA 
     variable is a part of the Kill logic.  In this patch, we removed the 
     DA variable from the Kill logic and placed it in a clean up routine 
     PSSDEE2.  
 
 2.  In routine PSSDEE at APP+0, we changed the statement, "MARK 
     THIS DRUG FOR AND EDIT" to "MARK THIS DRUG AND EDIT IT FOR:".  
 
 3.  It corrects a problem indicated in NOIS BIR-1098-32686. The site 
     indicated that the CMOP ID is no longer appearing in the Lookup into 
     Dispense Drug File [PSS LOOK] option.  This patch will correct 
     this problem.

 The following issues are included in the KIDS Build:
 
 1. A new INACTIVATION DATE field (#7) was added to the DOSAGE FORUM
    file #50.606. Also, a new INACTIVATION DATE field (#5) was added to
    the MEDICATION ROUTES file (#51.2).
 
 2. The Enter/Edit Drug Interaction [PSS INTERACTION LOCAL ADD] option
    will be modified to generate a MailMan message whenever a local drug
    interaction are added or a change is made to the severity of a
    nationally entered drug interaction.
 
 3. Two new fields were added to the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7). The
    fields are PMIS PRINTER (#13) and PMIS LANGUAGE (#14). The Parameters
    Edit [PSS SYS EDIT] option will allow the user to access the fields.
 
 4. In reference to the Lookup into Dispense Drug File [PSS LOOK] option,
    code was added to routine PSSLOOK to display the National Formulary
    and National Restriction fields.
 
 5. In reference to the CMOP Mark/Unmark [PSXX MARK] option, code was
    added to routine PSSDINT to display the reasons why a drug cannot be
    marked for CMOP use.
 
 6. This patch also corrects a potential problem found when generating
    the default frequency using the option Standard Schedule Edit [PSS
    SCHEDULE EDIT].

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 This patch contains the following enhancements.
 
 1.  In the Standard Schedule Edit [PSS SCHEDULE EDIT] option, it
     increases the maximum value of the Frequency (IN MINUTES) field (#2)
     from 50000 to 129600 minutes in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file
     (#51.1).
 
 2.  In the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option, it increases
     the decimal length from three to four digits when displaying the
     DISPENSE UNITS PER ORDER UNIT field (#15) in the DRUG file (#50).
 
 3.  In reference to the MEDICATION INSTRUCTION file (#51), this patch:
     a.  Replaces erroneous %D subscripts in the ^PS(51 data globals by
         restoring the MEDICATION INSTRUCTION file (#51) data dictionary.
         (ex. ^PS(51,%D,...).
     b.  Re-indexes the "A" cross-references on the NAME field (#.01).
     c.  Reinstalls full set of DDs related to the MEDICATION INSTRUCTION
        file (#51).
 
 4.  During the Computerize Patient Record System (CPRS) Order Entry
     process, the schedule input transform routine PSSGSO was not allowing
     schedules 5TIMES/DAY and 5X/DAY to pass as valid non-standard
     schedules. This patch contains modifications to routine PSSGS0
     to allow these schedules to be entered.

<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2000-05-16 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 Modifications were made to two options, CMOP Mark/Unmark (Single drug) 
 [PSSXX MARK] and Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT]. These 
 modifications were required to enable drugs identified as a Schedule 
 III-V controlled substance to be marked for CMOP transmission.  
 
 1. Both options were modified to remove the screen that disallows a drug 
    identified as a Schedule III-V controlled substance to be marked for 
    CMOP transmission. 
 
 2. The program currently checks for a "C" - CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES - NON 
    NARCOTIC in the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the drug to be marked 
    for transmission.  Routine PSSMARK was modified to check for a "1" - 
    SCHEDULE 1, or a "2" - SCHEDULE 2 in the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3).
    If these values are assigned to the selected drug, the option will
    not allow the user to mark the drug for CMOP transmission.
 
 3. Routines PSSMARK and PSSDEE were modified to change the current 
    message display, "It is a controlled substance" to "It is a schedule 
    I or schedule II controlled substance" when a user attempts to mark
    a controlled substance drug that does contains a "1" or "2" in the
    DEA SPECIAL HDLG field (#3).  
 
 4. The Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option was modified to 
    display a new message to reflect changes to the option. Routine 
    PSSMARK was modified to check for a "1" or a "2" in the DEA,
    SPECIAL HDLG field (#3). If either of these values exist and the drug
    is already marked for CMOP transmission, the option shall display a
    message to the user indicating that the drug has been unmarked for 
    CMOP transmission.  
 
 5. The Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option has been enhanced to 
    provide a list of reasons why a drug can not be marked for CMOP 
    transmission.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 This patch contains one resolution.
 
 Problem: This patch resolves a problem related to a report created by the
 Patients on Specific Drug(s) [PSJ PDV] option associated with the
 Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 application.  The Pharmacy Data Management
 (PDM) V. 1.0 application allows the Patients on Specific Drug(s) [PSJ
 PDV] option to access data stored in the "AOC" MUMPS cross-reference to
 produce a report on specific VA Classification.  A facility reported that
 they noticed missing entries after generating the report.  When using the
 Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option, entries in the "AOC" MUMPS
 cross-reference only exist if the VA CLASSIFICATION field (#2) was
 entered after the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM field (#2.1) in the DRUG file
 (#50).
 
 Solution: To make sure entries are properly set, this patch replaces the
 "AOC" MUMPS cross-reference with a new "AOC" compound index associated
 with the VA CLASSIFICATION field (#2) and PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM field
 (#2.1) in the DRUG file (#50). This solution will create an entry in the
 "AOC" compound index anytime both fields are modified regardless of the
 order.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 This patch contains several problems and resolutions related Pharmacy 
 Data Management V. 1.0. 
 
 1.  Problem:  In the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option, a 
 problem was discovered with identifying an inactive orderable item 
 before it is matched or tied to a dispense drug. Users find it difficult
 to select an active orderable item since the inactive date is not 
 displayed.  
 
 Resolution:  The characteristics of the INACTIVE DATE field (#.04) in the
 PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) was enhanced by classifying the
 field as an identifier.  When the user performs a lookup on selectable
 orderable items, the option will display the inactive date associated
 with the orderable item.
 
 2.  Problem:  In the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option, the 
 user noticed excessive looping after matching or tying an IV Additive or 
 Solution to an orderable item.  The user is asked repeatedly to enter 
 another IV Additive or Solution.  The user has to press return several 
 times to move to the next section in the option.  
 
 Resolution:  The Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option was 
 enhanced to allow the user to decide whether to enter another IV 
 Additive or Solution before moving to the next section.  
 
 3.  Problem: In the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option, the 
 user encountered an &lt;UNDEFINED&gt; UD^PSSDEE error when editing a drug that 
 has been previously marked for CMOP. After the "Do you wish to UNmark 
 this drug to transmit to CMOP? " prompt, the problem occurred as a result
 of killing the DA variable found at line tag UNMARK+1 in the PSSMARK 
 routine. When the coding logic returned to the PSSDEE routine, the DA 
 variable was detected as undefined since it was not reset to its 
 original value. 
 
 Resolution:  In reference to the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] 
 option, the PSSDEE routine was modified to store the value of the DA 
 variable into an alternate variable so that the value of the DA variable 
 can be retained for further use.  
 
 4.  Problem:  A minor enhancement was added to the Edit Orderable Items 
 [PSS EDIT ORDERABLE ITEMS] option.  When editing the CORRESPONDING IV 
 ITEM field (#4) or CORRESPONDING UD ITEM field (#3) in the PHARMACY 
 ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7), the default prompt only showed the orderable
 item name and did not include any reference to the DOSAGE FORM field 
 (#.02) in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7).  The selection 
 process was confusing if there were multiple orderable items with the 
 same name with different dosage forms.  
 
 Resolution: To alleviate confusion, the Edit Orderable Items [PSS EDIT 
 ORDERABLE ITEMS] option was enhanced to display a message to the user 
 prior to the prompt. The message will indicate both the orderable item 
 name and dosage form information.  
 
 5.  Problem: In the Edit Orderable Items [PSS EDIT ORDERABLE ITEMS] 
 option, the user noticed a problem with modifying and storing information
 related to the orderable item. The problem was related to an outdated 
 global reference to a reconstructed National Drug File (NDF) file within 
 the input transform placed on the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM field (#2.1) in
 the DRUG file (#50).  
 
 Resolution: To resolve this problem, the input transform associated with 
 the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM field (#2.1) was modified by replacing the 
 old NDF global reference with a NDF Application Programming Interfaces 
 (API) call to retrieve the dosage form information from the proper file.
 
 
 6.  Problem: The Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option failed to 
 notify the user when a dispense drug is matched or tied to an inactive 
 orderable item. The user would like to see a warning message before s/he 
 is asked, "Do you want to match to a different Orderable Item? NO//." 
 
 Resolution:  To resolve this problem, the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG 
 ENTER/EDIT] option was enhanced to warn the user when a dispense drug is 
 matched or tied to an inactive orderable item and provide the name of the
 option where the user can make the proper changes.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1.  Several sites have reported a problem when trying to document the
dispensing of medications through the Bar Code Med Admin (BCMA)
software.  The sites have reported receiving the following error:
 
1. Data Validation Error: 701: The value 'AC' for field DOSES ORDERED in
DISPENSE DRUG SUB-FIELD in file BCMA MEDICATION LOG is not valid.
 
The problem was with the input transform on the UNITS PER DOSE field
(#.02) in the DISPENSE DRUG sub-file (#53.4502) of the INPATIENT USER
PARAMETERS file (#53.45) and the DISPENSE DRUG sub-file (#53.11) of the
NON-VERIFIED ORDERS file (#53.1). The problem with the input transform
also exists in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55), UNIT DOSE sub-file
(#55.06), DISPENSE DRUG sub-file (#55.07), UNITS PER DOSE field (#.02).
Patch PSJ*5*43 corrects the problem in the INPATIENT USER PARAMETERS file
(#53.45) and the NON-VERIFIED ORDERS file (#53.1). This patch corrects
this problem in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55). NOIS#s NOL-0300-71473,
HOU-0300-71626, and CMO-0300-43187.
 
2.  Site reported a problem where they entered an infusion rate of @x and
x labels didn't print.  Only 1 label printed.  The issue is that only one
administration time was specified.  The administration time overrides the
entry of @x when determining how many labels will print.  This patch
modifies the field descriptions and the documentation for INFUSION RATE in
order to clarify which field determines the number of labels.  Modified
USUAL INFUSION RATE field (#2) in the IV ADDITIVES file (#52.6), QUICK
CODE sub-file (#52.61) and the INFUSION RATE field (#.08) in the PHARMACY
PATIENT file (#55), IV sub-file (#55.01).
 
3.  The vendor for the ATC systems called to say they now have two
machines with canister numbers higher than currently allowed.  This patch
modifies the ATC CANISTER field (#1) of the DRUG file (#50), ATC CANISTER
sub-file (#50.0212) to increase the canister limit from 500 to 800 and
remove the references to Baxter since the company name has changed.  This
patch also modified the following entries to remove the references to the
company name of Baxter:  DRUG file (#50), ATC CANISTER sub-file (#212),
field description, DRUG file (#50), ATC MNEMONIC field (#212.2), DRUG file
(#50), ATC CANISTER sub-file (#212), WARD GROUP FOR ATC CANISTER field
(.01).
 
4.  An inconsistency was discovered between the Computerized 
Patient Record System (CPRS) and the Inpatient Medications validation of
Provider Comments/Special Instructions.  CPRS allows entry of text with no
spaces while Inpatient Medications requires spaces.  This patch corrects
this problem by modifying the validation of Special Instructions to allow
an entry with no spaces.
 
5.  The INPATIENT PRESCRIPTION PROFILE field (#70) in the PHARMACY PATIENT
file (#55) is no longer used.  This patch deletes this field.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch exports two new options that can be used to assist sites in the
pharmacy set-up work for the Pharmacy Ordering Enhancements (POE) project.
The two options are named:
 
          Orderable Item/Dosages Report [PSS ORDERABLE ITEM DOSAGES]
          Patient Instructions Report [PSS INSTRUCTIONS/ITEMS REPORT]
 
These options will be accessible under the Orderable Item Management [PSS
ORDERABLE ITEM MANAGEMENT] menu option.
 
Orderable Item/Dosages Report [PSS ORDERABLE ITEM DOSAGES] option:
This option prints a report that displays Inpatient and Outpatient
Dosages for Pharmacy Orderable Items. These are the dosages that will
display for selection through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)
when an Orderable Item is selected for a medication order. The report is
sorted by Pharmacy Orderable Item. Along with each dosage that is
displayed on the report, the name of the Drug entry from the DRUG file
(#50) that provides the dosage will also display. Not every dosage from
the DRUG file (#50) will display on this report. For example, if there are
duplicate Possible Dosages for a Pharmacy Orderable Item, and there are
different Dispense Units per Dose, then only the Possible Dosage with the
lowest Dispense Units per Dose will display on the report. If there are
Possible Dosages and Local Possible Dosages for drugs tied to the Pharmacy
Orderable Item, then only the Possible Dosages will display on the report.
In summary, this report will screen out Possible Dosages and Local
Possible Dosage when appropriate, so only the dosages selectable through
CPRS will display on this report.
 
 
Patient Instructions Report [PSS INSTRUCTIONS/ITEMS REPORT] option:
Due to numerous requests, a change has been made to the PATIENT
INSTRUCTIONS field (#7) of the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7). Data
in this field will now be checked for possible expansions, by running each
word through the MEDICATION INSTRUCTION file (#51), similar to how the
SIG has been traditionally expanded in the Outpatient Pharmacy
application. The data will still be stored in condensed form, but will
print in expanded form when used by the various applications in POE. This
includes all reports, displays in CPRS, displays in Outpatient Pharmacy,
and when the SIG prints on the Outpatient Pharmacy labels. It is important
that any Patient Instructions entered prior the installation of this patch
be reviewed, to ensure that if a word didn't expand when originally
entered and now does expand, that the expansion is appropriate. The
Patient Instructions Report option can be used to review any Patient
Instructions that are entered in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7).
 
In addition to the new Patient Instructions Report, this patch makes a
change to the PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS field (#7) of the PHARMACY ORDERABLE
ITEM file (#50.7). When data is entered into this field, the expanded
version of the data will now echo back to the user.
 
 
 
Change pages have been issued for the Pharmacy Ordering Enhancements
Pharmacy Data Management Pre-Release Implementation Guide, initially
distributed with patch PSS*1*34. These change pages can be obtained on the
VISTA Pharmacy Data Management web page at

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Phase 1 of the Pharmacy Ordering Enhancements (POE) project introduced
functionality to create Possible Dosages and Local Possible Dosages in the
DRUG (#50) file. This work is being done in preparation of phase 2 of the
POE project, when these Possible Dosages and Local Possible Dosages will
be selectable during the Medication Ordering process in Outpatient
Pharmacy, Inpatient Medications, and Computerized Patient Record System
(CPRS).
 
One of the criteria that an entry in the DRUG (#50) file must meet for
that entry to have Possible Dosages is that the combination of Dosage Form
and Unit from the National Drug File match must be marked as convertible
in the DOSAGE FORM (#50.606) file. This data in the DOSAGE FORM (#50.606)
file was populated at the Field Office and exported with patch PSS*1*34.
This data should only be edited and exported from the Field Office,
so this patch is exporting the data again, and will put restrictions on
those particular fields. This patch will also put restrictions on fields
in the DRUG (#50) file, to prevent invalid Possible Dosages from being
created. In addition, this patch will look for any invalid Possible
Dosages in the DRUG (#50) file, and either delete that Possible Dosage, or
remove the invalid package reference from that Possible Dosage. A mail
message will also be generated that lists any drugs that were affected by
this install. This message will be sent to the person installing the
patch, and all PSNMGR key holders. Reasons that a Possible Dosage would
have to be deleted are:
 
1) The drug is not matched to the National Drug File.
2) The match to the National Drug File does not produce a valid Unit or
   Dosage Form.
3) The Unit from the National Drug File match does not match the Unit in
   the DRUG (#50) file.
4) The combination of Dosage Form/Unit from the National Drug File match
   is not marked as convertible in the DOSAGE FORM (#50.606) file.

The Pharmacy Ordering Enhancements (POE) project provides enhancements
to Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0, Inpatient Medications
V. 5.0, Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0, and Order Entry/Results Reporting
(OE/RR) V. 3.0 medication ordering dialogues to eliminate redundant entry
of drug information during medication order entry, provide a more
consistent medication order entry process, provide expanded order
checking, display documented drug formulary statuses and corresponding
restriction/guidelines to the provider and pharmacist at the time of order
entry, and improve the process of medication order transfer between
Inpatient Medications and Outpatient Pharmacy applications.  This project
directly supports Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), which is a
key component of Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) plan to expand
support for clinical operations. Additionally, order checks will be
provided for medication orders for which a dispense drug has not been
selected during the CPRS order entry process. It is also intended as a way
to help meet the goal outlined in Objective 8, Action 1 in the
Prescription for Change, which outlines the need to coordinate
national/Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) formularies and share
drug treatment guideline information. This project will promote system-
wide sharing of drug reviews and treatment guidelines thereby enhancing
patient safety.
 
This project consists of four patches that work together to accomplish
these goals listed in order of install:
 
     PSO*7*46
     OR*3*94
     PSS*1*38
     PSJ*5*50

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;49 SEQ #45</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2001-12-31 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1) A problem has been reported concerning certain dosage selections in
   Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 and Computerized Patient Record System
   (CPRS) V. 3.0. The problem is in the Dosages that contain a "/", and
   when the second part of that Dosage begins with a decimal point. A
   leading zero was not being added to that second part of the Dosage. For
   example, a Dosage that is currently being displayed as 0.25MG/.5ML will
   be displayed as 0.25MG/0.5ML.
 
  This change will affect the following:
  - The Review Dosages Report [PSS DOSAGE REVIEW REPORT] option.
  - The Orderable Item/Dosages Report [PSS ORDERABLE ITEM DOSAGES] option.
  - Display the leading zero when editing Dosages through either the Drug
    Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option or the Enter/Edit Dosages [PSS
    EDIT DOSAGES] option.
  - The display of Dispense Units per Dose has also been changed in the
    Pharmacy Data Management options to display a leading zero when the
    number begins with a decimal point.
 
2) This patch also contains a change that will affect Computerized Patient
   Record System (CPRS). The Pharmacy Data Management package returns
   information to CPRS regarding the DEA Special Handling indication of a
   Pharmacy Orderable item, which is based on the DEA Special Handling
   information from the Dispense Drugs tied to the Pharmacy Orderable
   Item. Currently, if the DEA Special Handling code contains a "1", or
   contains a "2", or contains both the "3" and the "A", this indicates to
   CPRS that a wet signature is required. If this first condition is not
   met, but the DEA Special Handling code contains a "4", or contains a
   "5", or contains a "3" and not the "A", then a wet signature is not
   required, but it does indicate that it is a controlled substance. This
   patch changes that logic. With the installation of this patch, if the
   DEA Special Handling code contains a "1", or contains a "2", this
   indicates to CPRS that a wet signature is required. If this first
   condition is not met, but the DEA Special Handling code contains a "3",
   or contains a "4", or contains a "5", then a wet signature is not
   required, but it does indicate that it is a controlled substance.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. A site reported a problem where a one-time order could not be
discontinued by the provider because it was expired due to the start and
stop date being the same. However, the medication still displayed in Bar
Code Medication Administration (BCMA) V. 1.0 because of the 12-hour rule
for displaying one-time orders on the Virtual Due List.  This patch
corrects this problem by changing the way the stop date for one-time
orders is calculated. There will be a ward parameter, system parameter and
the standard calculation. The hierarchy will be to check the one-time ward
parameter first, if not defined, check the system parameter.  If the
system parameter is not defined, the system will use the continuous order
parameters to determine the stop date, rather than the start and stop date
being equal.  Then, when BCMA marks the medication as 'Given', Inpatient
Medications will expire the order. NOIS# BUT-0501-20609
 
2. With the release of the Pharmacy Ordering Enhancements patches two
spaces were allowed in the schedule field.  In testing, it was discovered
that a user could enter the two spaces at the end of the schedule and it
was accepted by the software.  The software was not intended to work this
way.  Upon installation of this patch, the trailing spaces will be
stripped off the text the user enters at the schedule prompt.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. A problem has been reported in the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG
   ENTER/EDIT] option. If a drug is edited that is not matched to Pharmacy
   Orderable Item, and the drug is matched to a Pharmacy Orderable Item in
   this option, then the Possible Dosages are reset after completion of
   the match. Possible Dosages should only be reset if the drug is matched
   to a Pharmacy Orderable Item when the option is first accessed, and the
   drug is rematched to a different Pharmacy Orderable Item with a
   different Dosage Form.
 
2. A problem was reported in the Dispense Drug/Orderable Item Maintenance
   [PSS MAINTAIN ORDERABLE ITEMS] option. If a drug is not marked for
   Outpatient (O), Unit Dose (U), or IV (I) in the APPLICATION PACKAGES'
   USE (#63) field of the DRUG (#50) file, then it is not selectable in
   this option. These drugs will now be selectable. They will still not be
   selectable for ordering, but now they can be matched to a Pharmacy
   Orderable Item.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
A problem can occur in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) when 
duplicate Local Possible Dosages are displayed for selection in the 
medication order entry process, and these duplicate Local Possible 
Dosages have a duplicate Strength and Unit as part of the display. For 
example, a dosage selection display such as:
 
SMALL AMOUNT OF 0.1%
SMALL AMOUNT OF 0.025%
SMALL AMOUNT OF 0.1%
 
In this example, the first and third Dosages come from different Dispense 
Drugs, but since each of these drugs has a top level Strength and Unit 
from the National Drug File match, the Strength and Unit are displayed 
instead of the Dispense Drug name, which makes the selection ambiguous. 
In addition, no matter which of these Local Possible Dosages is selected, 
the first or the third, the same Dispense Drug is assigned to the order.
 
To fix this problem, this patch will make a change to the way Local 
Possible Dosages are returned to CPRS for display and selection. As in 
this case, if there are duplicate Local Possible Dosages in the list, and 
one of the duplicate sets also has a duplicate Strength and Unit for
different Dispense Drugs, then the Strength will not be returned to CPRS
along with the Local Possible Dosages. Then instead of CPRS displaying the
Strength and Unit, CPRS will display the Dispense Drug name, which should
differentiate the selection display, as long as the Dispense Drug names
are different. This will also resolve the selection problem of the same
Dispense Drug being assigned to the order, regardless of the selection.

1. It was reported that although some Dosage Form entries are inactivated,
   they are still showing up in the following options:
      -Dosage Form File Enter/Edit [PSS DOSAGE FORM EDIT].
      -Noun/Dosage Form Report [PSS DOSE FORM/NOUN REPORT].
   This patch insures that the inactivated entries will not be displayed
   in those options.
 
2. When using the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option, it was
   reported that if the drug is selected using the synonym entry, some-
   times it picks a wrong drug. This problem is due to the existence of
   an old cross-references ("IV", "IV1", and "IV2") in the DRUG file
   (#50). This patch fixes this problem.

1. When using the Drug Enter/edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option and the
   Enter/Edit dosages [PSS EDIT DOSAGES] option, currently the software
   displays the Strength and the Unit of a drug only if it finds Possible
   Dosages assigned to that drug. This patch modifies routines PSSDOS and
   PSSDOSER to display the Strength, and the Unit of a drug that also has
   Local Possible Dosages assigned for the following conditions:
 
 - The software will populate the Strength of the drug from the STRENGTH
   field (#901) of the DRUG file (#50) if it is defined, otherwise it will
   populate from the STRENGTH field (#2) of the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68).
 
 - The software will populate the Unit of the drug from the UNIT field
   (#902) of the DRUG file (#50) if it is defined, otherwise it will
   populate from the UNIT field (#3) of the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68).
 
 - If both the Strength and the Unit fields are not populated then the
   software will display null values.
 
2. When creating new dosages for a drug, the PACKAGE field (#3) in
   the DOSAGES multiple (#903) of the DRUG file (#50) is case-
   sensitive (allows only capital letters). This patch modifies the Input
   Transform of the PACKAGE field to accept lowercase letters as well.
 
3. When using the Dosage Form File Enter/Edit [PSS DOSAGE FORM EDIT]
   option, it was reported that the MED ROUTE FOR DOSAGE FORM field (#.01)
   in the MED ROUTE FOR DOSAGE FORM multiple (#50.6061) of the DOSAGE FORM
   file (#50.606) can be assigned a Medication Route entry with a PACKAGE
   USE field (#3) of "FOR NATIONAL DRUG FILE ONLY" from the MEDICATION
   ROUTES file (#51.2). This patch prevents such Medication Route entries
   from being assigned to the MED ROUTE FOR DOSAGE FORM multiple.

As a part of the Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Extract enhancement
project, two new fields were added to the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55).
They are FIRST SERVICE DATE (#.07) and ACTUAL/HISTORICAL FLAG (#.08).
With the addition of these two fields, Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 and
Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 have been modified to set this information
when the first order for a patient becomes active.
 
This project consists of three patches combined in a master build.
Installation of this master build should be coordinated among the three
packages affected since only one installation is necessary.  The patches,
in order of install, are:
 
      PSS*1*52  PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT V. 1.0
      PSJ*5*68  INPATIENT MEDICATIONS V. 5.0
      PSO*7*95  OUTPATIENT PHARMACY V. 7.0
 
Upon completion of the installation of these three patches, the master
build will start a routine that will build the two new fields from
historical data in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55).  When the build is
complete, the user who initiated the install and the members of the
PSU PBM mail group will receive a message with a subject of BUILD OF FIRST
PHARMACY SERVICE INFO COMPLETE.

HUI/VHA CIO SD&amp;D PHARMACY DATA INTERCHANGE
 
1. This patch is in support of the Hui/VHA CIO SD&amp;D Pharmacy Data
Interchange project. The project provides a method for the one-way
electronic transfer of prescription orders from an external system to VistA
 
The purpose of this patch is to provide an HL7 notification of the addition
of new drugs and drug updates to the DRUG file (#50). To receive this 
notification, the receiving protocol must be attached to the sending
protocol SEND DRUG UPDATE MESSAGE [PSS HUI DRUG UPDATE] as a subscriber.
To activate the sending of these HL7 messages the text from DISABLE field
must be deleted and at least one receiving protocol added as a subscriber.  
 
For those sites who ARE NOT part of the Hui/VHA CIO SD&amp;D Pharmacy Data 
Interchange project, NO FURTHER ACTION is necessary after installation of
the patch.  
 
 
2. When performing drug lookups, two issues were identified. First, the was
not aware of which item was being matched. For example, was the match for
the GENERIC NAME of the drug or was it the SYNONYM. The second issue had to
do with the search matching to the NATIONAL DRUG CLASS NAME first, before
checking for a GENERIC NAME. 
 
This patch makes two changes to the drug lookup. First, the search will
display the item being searched on. Second, if a match is found on an item,
but the user doesn't select one of the matches displayed, the search will
continue through all other items.

The Pharmacy Data Management Drug Text Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG TEXT
ENTER/EDIT] option is being enhanced and a new Drug Text File Report [PSS
DRUG TEXT FILE REPORT] option is being added.
 
 
The Drug Text File Report [PSS DRUG TEXT FILE REPORT] option displays the
drug text name, synonyms, drug text, inactive date if inactive, and lists
all drug and orderable items linked to it. This report can be printed for
one or all entries.
 
The Drug Text Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG TEXT ENTER/EDIT] option was changed to
enhance the text displayed when editing or inactivating an entry. The new
text identifies the specific option that can be used to display linked
items.
 
The following cross-references were created for use in generating a list
of DRUG file (#50) entries and PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7)
entries associated with a DRUG TEXT file (#51.7) entry and for generating
the report in the Drug Text File Report [PSS DRUG TEXT FILE REPORT]
option:
  1. A full file cross-reference on the DRUG TEXT ENTRY field
(#50.037) in the DRUG file (#50).
  2. A full file cross-reference on the OI-DRUG TEXT ENTRY field (#50.76)
of the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7).
 
Note: The population of the new 'DTXT' cross reference is done in a
post-install background job. When this job completes, it will send a
MailMan message to the installer of the patch and holders of the
PSNMGR key. The new Drug Text File Report [PSS DRUG TEXT FILE REPORT]
option should then be run for all drug text entries in the DRUG TEXT
file (#51.7) to verify that the correct drug text is associated with the
correct entries in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) and the DRUG
file (#50). A listing of the original drug text file entries distributed
with Patch PSS*1*29 is provided in the Pharmacy Data Management user
manual.
 
There will be updates to the Pharmacy Data Management V.1.0 User and
Technical manuals for this patch.

1. This patch, in conjunction with CPRS patches OR*3.0*149 and OR*3.0*158,
   fixes a problem that can occur when entering an order for an outpatient
   in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) using the IV Fluids order
   dialogue. The DEA Special Handling check does not always function when
   entering those orders. So it is possible for a Provider without a DEA#
   or a VA# to enter an order through this dialogue for an Orderable Item,
   when that order should not be allowed to be placed. When this patch and
   both CPRS patches OR*3.0*149 and OR*3.0*158 are installed, this
   functionality will work properly. Patch OR*3.0*149 will fix this
   problem for orders entered through CPRS GUI, and patch OR*3.0*158 will
   fix this problem for orders entered through CPRS ListMan. No problems
   will occur if the PSS*1.0*66 patch is installed without either one or
   both of the CPRS patches, but the functionality will not work properly
   until all patches are installed. NOIS JAC-0602-72390
 
2. A site reported a problem with entering the cost information for drugs
   with cost like NNNNN.NNN per order unit. Currently, the PRICE PER ORDER
   UNIT field (#13) in the DRUG file (#50) only allows 4 digits before the
   decimal point. This patch modifies the Data Dictionary of this field to
   accommodate 5 digits. NOIS POR-0902-50198
 
3. A minor change has been made to the Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) 
   Application Program Interface (API) to allow other pharmacy packages to
   make use of it, whenever they update the DRUG file (#50) so that PDM 
   possibly generates an HL7 outgoing drug message.
 
4. A site reported a problem with the display of the cost information
   for drugs with local possible dosages. This patch corrects this
   problem. NOIS REN-0902-60126

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
PSS*1*68 and OR*3*176 are the first of a total of 6 patches that will 
comprise the Non-VA Meds (Herbals/OTC) project. These two patches are
being released together to deliver Phase 1 of this project, which is
explained in more details below. Phase 2 will contain the following 4
patches: PSS*1*69, PSO*7*132, PSJ*5*107 and OR*3*187. They will be
released in a later time. Once all patches are installed, they will
provide the sites the ability to document herbal supplements,
over-the-counter (OTC)(non-prescription) medications and other 
medications taken by patients but not dispensed by the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA). These types of medications are commonly referred
to as "Non-VA Meds."
  
Below is a list of functionalities that will be available at your site
once all 6 patches are installed: 
 
  1. Add common herbal and OTC products to the DRUG File and mark them 
     as Non-VA Med.  
  2. Enhance current Outpatient Pharmacy software to display patients 
     use of Non-VA Med.  
  3. Screen for drug-herbal and drug-drug interactions and display the 
     results in both Inpatient and Outpatient Pharmacy.  
  4. Display Non-VA Med drugs on the Orders and Meds tab in CPRS.  
  5. Display of drug interaction information involving Non-VA Med 
     through CPRS.  
 
The Phase 1 of this project comprises functionality 1 only. It gives the
sites the ability to add common herbal and OTC products to the DRUG File
and mark them as Non-VA Med through the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG
ENTER/EDIT] option. Furthermore, it also allows the user to mark existing
dispense drugs as Non-VA Med. Once a drug is marked as Non-VA Med, a
physician using the CPRS GUI Version 23 application will be able to
document the patient's use of such drug. Which is done by entering a
Non-VA Med order for the patient. Functionalities 2 through 5 are part of
the Phase 2 of this project and will be delivered in a later time.
 
An important part of this patch is the update of the Drug file. As
mentioned before, besides Herbal supplements and Over-the-Counter drugs
(usually non-prescription drugs), any prescribed medication currently
dispensed by the VA could be acquired by the patient from another source
other than the VA. Therefore, these drugs must also be marked as Non-VA
Med. In order to reduce the amount of work necessary to mark the existing
dispense drug for Non-VA Med use, the following update will occur
automatically with the installation of this patch: 
 
 EVERY ACTIVE DISPENSE DRUG MARKED FOR OUTPATIENT USE WILL BE MARKED FOR 
 NON-VA MED USE.  
 
The following menu options have also been modified: 
 
  1. Lookup into Dispense Drug File [PSS LOOK] 
 
     If the dispense drug is marked as Non-VA, it will now print "Non-VA 
     Med" in the "APPL PKG USE:" field.  
 
  2. Enter/Edit Dosages [PSS EDIT DOSAGES] 
     
     If the dispense drug is marked as Non-VA, it will now print "Non-VA
     Med" under "This entry is marked for the following 
     PHARMACY packages:." 
 
  3. Edit Orderable Items [PSS EDIT ORDERABLE ITEMS] 
 
     If the orderable item is marked as Non-VA, it will now print "This 
     Orderable Item is marked as a Non-VA Med." right after the indication
     of Formulary/Non-Formulary is printed.  
 
A new field NON-VA MED (#8) has been added to the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM
File (#50.7).

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Strategic Healthcare Group in
collaboration with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), requested
the development of the first Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) VistA
pilot project, named Electronic Prescription Order Entry for Schedule II
Controlled Substances. The objective is to develop an electronic order
entry system for Schedule II controlled substances using digital
signatures. To make this project viable, modifications to the following
packages were identified:
National Drug File (NDF) V. 4.0
Kernel V. 8.0
Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0
Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0
Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) V. 7.0
Controlled Substances (CS) V. 3.0
 
This is the PDM patch that provides the following new functionalities:
 
1. It provides CPRS with new API's 3737 and 3739 (these are modifications
of existing API's 3373 and 3233 which shall remain unchanged). The logic
of deriving at the DEA SPECIAL HDLG code for drugs associated with an
orderable item has changed. The National Drug File data update patches
PSN*4*64 and PSN*4*66 assign a CS Federal Schedule to controlled
substances and identify controlled substances as narcotics or
non-narcotics by populating the CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE field (#19) of the VA
PRODUCT file (#50.68). If any of the active dispense drugs associated with
the Pharmacy orderable item for the specified package are matched to an
entry in NDF, then the most restrictive CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE code will be
returned. If there is no match or the CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE code is
undefined, then the most restrictive DEA SPECIAL HDLG code mapped to the
corresponding CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE code will be returned using the
following table:
 
                         CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE     DEA, SPECIAL HDLG
Code
Schedule I narcotics            1                        1
Schedule II narcotics           2                       2A
Schedule II non-narcotics      2n                       2C
Schedule III narcotics          3                       3A
Schedule III non-narcotics     3n                       3C
Schedule IV narcotics           4                        4
Schedule V narcotics            5                        5
 
2. It includes a Post-Install routine to identify those drugs that show
discrepancies between the CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE field (#19) of the VA
PRODUCT file (#50.68) and DEA SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file
(#50), and generates the following 4 mail messages to the installer and
the holders of the PSNMGR keys:
CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE AND DEA, SPECIAL HDLG DISCREPANCIES
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES NOT MATCHED
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES NOT SET CORRECTLY
DISCREPANCY IN DEA WITHIN DRUGS TIED TO AN OI
 
These mail messages can be used to clean up the DEA SPECIAL HDLG code in
the DRUG file where appropriate.
 
3. It also provides the following new menu options to generate reports of
the above mail messages:
Controlled Substances/PKI Reports [PSS CS/PKI REPORTS] menu has the
following 4 new options:
  1 DEA Spec Hdlg &amp; CS Fed Sch Discrepancy [PSS DEA VS CS FED. SCH.
    DISCR.]
  2 Controlled Substances Not Matched to NDF [PSS CS NOT MATCHED TO NDF]
  3 CS (DRUGS) Inconsistent with DEA Spec Hdlg [PSS CS DRUGS INCON WITH
    DEA]
  4 CS (Ord. Item) Inconsistent with DEA Spec Hdlg [PSS CS (OI) INCON WITH
    DEA]
This new menu Controlled Substances/PKI Reports [PSS CS/PKI REPORTS],
will be added to the Pharmacy Data Management [PSS MGR] menu.
 
4. When using the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option, if the CS
FEDERAL SCHEDULE field (#19) of the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) and the DEA
SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file (#50) have a discrepancy, then
this patch displays a warning message, "The CS Federal Schedule associated
with this drug in the VA Product file represents a DEA, Special Handling
code of XX", where XX is the CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE code mapped to
corresponding DEA SPECIAL HDLG code as defined in the above table.
 
5. This patch ensures that the newly populated CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE field
(#19) of the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) is also included as part of the
drug details in the Lookup into Dispense Drug File [PSS LOOK] option.
 
6. This patch introduces a new code "F" for NON REFILLABLE for the DEA
SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file (#50). This will allow sites to
mark drugs other than controlled substances or clozapine drugs as NON
REFILLABLE. This functionality will be effective in the Outpatient
Pharmacy V. 7.0 package only if the patch PSO*7.0*131 is installed.
 
7. The designation "A" which stands for "NARCOTICS AND ALCOHOLICS" used in
the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file (#50), is changed in
this patch to read as "NARCOTICS AND ALCOHOLS".

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. PSS*1*69 provides additional internal preparation at your site for 
   the eventual release of the Herbal/OTC/Non-VA Meds Documentation 
   project.  
 
   An important part of this patch is the update of the DRUG file (#50).  
   The Post-install routine for patch PSS*1*68 automatically marked for 
   Non-VA Med use every active dispense drug that was marked for 
   outpatient use. Some of these dispense drugs marked for Non-VA Med use 
   were actually being used as supply items. A dispense drug is being 
   used as a supply if the entry in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file 
   (#50.7) it is associated with has the SUPPLY field (#.09) set to 1 
   (one). Many sites have expressed their concern about having supply 
   items automatically marked for Non-VA Med use. Therefore, sites can 
   automatically unmark such items through this patch. The unmarking of 
   supply items as Non-VA Meds will be optional. During the patch 
   installation the installer will be prompted "Unmark supply items as 
   Non-VA Meds? Y //". If 'YES' is selected, every supply item in the 
   DRUG file (#50) marked for Non-VA Med use will be unmarked. If for any 
   reason the installer chooses NOT to un-mark supply items for Non-VA 
   Med use and later wishes to do so, run the Mumps routine PSSUNMSI 
   distributed with this patch.  
 
2. A new multiple field NON-VA MEDS (#52.2), has been added to the 
   PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55). This field will be used in the future 
   to store Non-VA Med orders.
 
3. The NON-VA MED field (#8) in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7)
   is being modified to be "Uneditable".

This project consists of 12 patches that work together to create a new
Clinical Reminders index global. The purpose of this index is to provide
rapid access to clinical data. All of the standard Clinical Reminders
finding types are included in the index.
 
The 12 patches that comprise this project are:
 
 PXRM*1.5*12
 DG*5.3*478
 GMPL*2*27
 GMRV*4*15
 LR*5.2*295
 OR*3*157
 PSS*1*62
 PSJ*5*90
 PSO*7*118
 PX*1*119
 RA*5*33
 YS*5.01*77
 
The purpose of this patch (PSS*1*62) is to lay the groundwork for these
changes by creating a new cross-reference in the PHARMACY PATIENT file
(#55) at both the UNIT DOSE multiple (#62) and the IV multiple (#100).
 
This patch can be installed independently of the other patches. The 
documentation describing the new functionality will be available when all 
associated patches are released.

 Phase I of the Inpatient Medications Requirements for the Special Focus
 Group IRA project consists of four patches. The patches are combined in
 host file PSJ_PSS_OR_PSU_110.KID in order to simplify installation at VHA
 facilities. Installation of this host file should be coordinated among
 the four packages affected since only one installation is necessary. The
 patches, in order of install, are:
 
      PSS*1*79   PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT V. 1.0
      PSJ*5*110  INPATIENT MEDICATIONS V. 5.0
      OR*3*213   ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING V. 1.0
      PSU*3*34   PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGEMENT V. 3.0
 
 Patches PSS*1*79, OR*3*213, and PSU*3*34 contain changes to support the
 following enhancements in PSJ*5*110:
 
 1. The Extend Stop Date on Renewal enhancements will allow an order to be
 renewed without creating a new order. Editing of the start date will no
 longer be allowed during the renewal process. In addition, limits have
 been set on the length of time after an order expires that it may be
 renewed. This is outlined in the BCMA 2001 Special Focus Report,
 Requirement #11.
  
 2. The Complex Order enhancements will change the way complex orders are
 handled by linking complex components (child orders) together. If the
 actions Finish, Verify, Discontinue, or Renew are taken on one child
 order, the user will be alerted that the action must be taken on all of
 the complex component orders in the set. The user will then be prompted
 to take the appropriate action on each child order in the complex order
 set. This is outlined in BCMA 2001 Special Focus Report, Requirement #8.
 
 3. The STAT and NOW Order Notification enhancements will alert users
 subscribing to new mail group PSJ STAT NOW PENDING ORDER when a pending
 STAT or NOW order has been received from Computerized Patient Record
 System (CPRS) V. 1.0. Users subscribing to the new mail group PSJ STAT
 NOW ACTIVE ORDER will receive an alert when a STAT or NOW order is made
 active. This is outlined in BCMA 2001 Special Focus Report, Requirement
 #12.
 
 In order to support the Extend Stop Date for Renewals changes, new fields
 will be created in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) and the PHARMACY
 SYSTEM file (#59.7).
 
 1. The PREVIOUS ORDERS FILE ENTRY sub-field (#4) will be added to the
 LAST RENEW multiple (#114) in the UNIT DOSE multiple (#62) in the
 PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55).
 
 2. The PREVIOUS ORDERS FILE ENTRY sub-field (#4) will be added to the
 LAST RENEW multiple (#138) in the IV multiple (#100) in the PHARMACY
 PATIENT file (#55).
 
 3. The EXPIRED IV TIME LIMIT field (#34) will be added to the PHARMACY
 SYSTEM file (#59.7).
 
 4. In support of Complex Orders changes, a new cross-reference will be
 created to group complex child orders by their parent order. For Unit
 Dose orders, the cross-reference will be indexed by the ORDERS FILE
 PARENT ORDER field (#125), the ORDERS FILE ENTRY field (#66), and the
 Unit Dose order number appended with "U". For IV orders, the cross-
 reference will be indexed by the ORDERS FILE PARENT ORDER field (#150),
 the ORDERS FILE ENTRY field (#110), and the IV order number appended with
 "V". The cross-reference definition will be created by the pre-install
 routine PSSCMPLX. These are the new cross-references added to the
 PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) and the fields used as the trigger-points.
 The type of these cross-references is "New", not "Traditional".

 There are three patches to support the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation
 Interface project. These patches should be installed separately in the
 following order:
                   PSO*7*156      Outpatient Pharmacy
                   PSS*1*82       Pharmacy Data Management
                   PSN*4*84       National Drug File
 
 They contain routines, templates, options, and data dictionary changes to
 implement the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface features. Please
 refer to the individual patch description of the other patches to get the
 names of the documentation files.
 
 Each patch will share the same starting description with more detail
 for each patch in the corresponding namespace patch number.  There is
 only one installation guide.  It can be found on the anonymous 
 directory.  The name of the installation guide 
 PS_OUTPATIENT_AUTOMATION_INTERFACE_IG.doc.
 
                   
 The patch enhances the current Health Level Seven (HL7) interface to
 ensure that the interface is compatible with all current Outpatient
 Pharmacy package V. 7.0 automation systems used by the Veterans Affairs
 Medical Centers (VAMCs).  The current national VISTA HL7 interface is
 written to HL7 standard V. 2.2.  Automated dispensing systems, such as
 the Baker APS Pharmacy 2000, are currently using an interface written to
 HL7 V. 2.3.1 standard using locally developed software.  The automated
 dispensing systems have committed to be HL7 V. 2.4 compliant.
 
 This patch includes the following new features:
 1.  Creates an HL7 interface to the current HL7 V. 2.4 standard.
 2.  The interface transmits drug data to multiple vendor systems
     utilized by VAMCs whenever the following options are selected:
     A. Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option.
     B. Edit Orderable Items [PSS EDIT ORDERABLE ITEMS] option.
     C. Enter/Edit Dosages [PSS EDIT DOSAGES] option.
     D. Dispense Drug/Orderable Item Maintenance [PSS MAINTAIN ORDERABLE 
        ITEMS] option.
     E. CMOP Mark/Unmark (Single drug) [PSSXX MARK] option.
     F. Synonym Enter/Edit [PSS SYNONYM EDIT] option.
 
 
 HL7 Interface:
 ==============
 This patch installs the following new HL7 Protocols:
 1. PDM Master File Update [PSS EXT MFU SERVER] protocol.
 2. PDM Master File Update Client [PSS EXT MFU CLIENT] protocol.
 
 This patch installs the following new HL7 Application Parameters:
 1. PSS VISTA
 2. PSS DISPENSE
 
 New Option:
 ===========
 A new option has been added to the PSS MGR menu called Send Entire 
 Drug File to External Interface [PSS MASTER FILE ALL]. This is used to
 send the entire drug file to a dispensing system at first start-up to 
 bring the dispensing system in synch with the National Drug file (#50).
 Each dispensing system will decide if they can receive these messages and
 a parameter setting ENABLE MASTER FILE UPDATE will need to be turned on
 in the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) in order for these messages to be sent
 across.

This patch contains Application Programmer Interface's (API's) that will 
be used by calling applications that currently do direct global reads or 
writes to the Pharmacy Data Management files.  Since the DRUG file (#50), 
and other drug-related files are being replaced by a vendor product, any 
direct M-based global reads or writes to these files must be replaced by 
calling the API's provided in this patch. When the new data source is in 
place, the calling applications will not be required to make any changes, 
because these API's will be flexible enough to retrieve the requested 
data from the vendor product, when the time comes.
 
These are the files that are affected. If any application is making 
direct global reads or writes to any of these files, they must be 
replaced by using the API's exported with this patch.

PATCH OVERVIEW
 
The Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act National 
Council for Prescription Drug Programs (HIPAA NCPDP) initiative, whose 
ultimate goal is to provide functionality allowing electronic transmission
of Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) prescription claims to payers and the receipt 
of claim responses (including drug utilization review responses and 
warnings) on a real-time basis, is being developed and introduced in a 
phased implementation strategy. This deployment strategy was utilized due 
to the complexity of the functionality and the number of product line 
dependencies.
 
The first release of this two part implementation is BPS*1*0, comprised of
the new Electronic Claims Management Engine (ECME) package (in the BPS 
namespace), plus the patches PSS*1*81, IB*2.0*223, IB*2.0*251, and 
PRCA*4.5*202, which are listed here in order of installation. BPS*1*0 is a
dormant release that only allows each site to perform preliminary setup 
work and to confirm that the software does not adversely affect other 
packages.
 
There are two main areas addressed by BPS*1*0:
 
a. Registration of the Pharmacy with the Vitria BusinessWare IE.
b. The Insurance Matching of Group Plans with Pharmacy Plans
 
Following the installation of BPS*1*0, each site must register their 
pharmacy with Vitria and match applicable insurance group plans using the 
insurance matching screens. These processes are detailed in the HIPAA 
NCPDP CONNECTION FOR EDI PHARMACY INSTALLATION GUIDE and the E-PHARMACY
CLAIMS INSURANCE PROCESS document. Both of these documents are located on
the anonymous directory. It is very important that the IRM or person
installing the patch at each facility provide a copy of these documents to
its ADPAC(s) and any other relevant staff who will be responsible for
registering their pharmacy with Vitria and completing the insurance 
matching process.
 
At a later date, additional HIPAA NCPDP patches will be released to 
activate all of the HIPAA NCPDP functionality. Until that time, sites will
not be able to electronically submit claims utilizing this new 
functionality.
 
The HIPAA NCPDP project was created in response to a Chief Business Office
(CBO) request for modifications to several Veterans Health Information 
Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) software applications in 
accordance with HIPAA Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions and 
NCPDP mandated format standards, specifically the NCPDP Telecommunication 
Standard v.5.1.
 
The specific functionality for this patch is listed below.
 
Overview of the Process:
 
The changes to Pharmacy Data Management are as follows:
 
1. DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) in the DRUG (#50) file.
 
Routine PSSDDUT2 was modified to accommodate the use of the letter 'E' 
within the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file (#50).
 
 
Data Dictionary Changes in Outpatient Pharmacy:
 
1. For the DRUG file (#50), the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG (#3) field for the drug
will need to accommodate the use of the letter 'E' to indicate that a drug
is billable for ECME purposes.  The routine dealing with the Help Text of
this field was modified to accommodate the inclusion of an 'E' within the
list of possible entries.

    followed by BPS_1_0. In our example, the file name is
    USER$:[ANONYMOUS]BPS_1_0.KID. Determine the location where you stored
    your build to decide the correct file name entry.
 
 6. At the "Want to Continue with Load? YES//" prompt, enter YES.
 
 7. At the "Want to RUN the Environment Check Routine: YES//" prompt, 
    answer YES.
 
 8. From this menu, the installer may select to use the following options:
 
(When prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter BPS 1.0)
 
    a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
    message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup
    any other changes such as DDs or templates.
 
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will allow
    you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is installed.
    It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs, templates,
    etc.).
 
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will ensure the 
    integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
 
 9. At the "Select Installation Option:" prompt, enter 6 Install 
    Package(s)

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. The Inpatient Medications Orders for Outpatients project will allow a
user the ability to order unit dose medications for outpatients. This is 
accomplished through modifications to Inpatient Medications V. 5.0,
Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0, and Scheduling V. 5.3.
The purpose of this patch is to create three new fields in the PHARMACY
PATIENT file (#55). In the UNIT DOSE multiple (#62), the CLINIC field
(#130) and the APPOINTMENT DATE/TIME field (#131) have been added. In the
IV multiple (#100), the APPOINTMENT DATE/TIME field (#139) has been added.
 
2. A new parameter has been added to the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7). It 
is the AUTO-DC IMO ORDERS field (#26.8). This new parameter will allow 
sites to control whether or not Inpatient Medications Orders for 
Outpatients are automatically discontinued during patient movements. This 
parameter will only be effective if sites are using Inpatient Medications 
to control discontinues on patient movements. If the site is using the 
CPRS auto-dc rules, this parameter will have no effect.
 
3. As a part of the Inpatient Medications Requirements for the Special
Focus Group IRA project, this patch modifies the definition of schedules
in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1). TO accomplish this, the 
following changes are being made to the PSSJ SCHEDULE EDIT input 
template:
     a. Do not allow entry of a schedule with the name of OTHER. 
     b. Do not allow entry of administration times for odd schedules. 
     c. Display the calculated frequency to the user.
 
4. Based on the upcoming requirement from the Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Hospital Organizations, schedule names that are
considered dangerous will no longer be allowed. The four schedules that 
will no longer be allowed are: QD, HS, TIW and QOD. These schedules 
cannot be used either alone or as part of a schedule name. For example: 
QD is not allowed. Neither is QD ONCE.
 
5. The Inpatient Medications Requirements for the Special Focus Group IRA
project will prevent users from entering free text schedules for inpatient
medication orders. This patch helps accomplish this by changing the
validation of schedules entered through Computerized Patient Record System
(CPRS) V. 1.0. This validation requires that schedules be defined in the
ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) or be a valid day-of-week, PRN or
administration time schedule before allowing the schedule to be added to
an inpatient order.
 
6. A provider entering an order into Computerized Patient Record System
(CPRS) V. 1.0 must be permitted to place a limitation on the duration of
an inpatient medication order. This capability exists for Unit Dose orders
and Inpatient IV orders, but not for IV Fluid orders. This patch helps 
accomplish this by adding a new field to the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55), 
IV multiple (#100) called REQUESTED IV LIMITATION (#152).

As part of the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 Laser Labels Phase II project, 
a new commercial data source will be utilized to provide warning label
information. 
 
This patch is required by PSO*7*161 which does the printing of the 
warning labels on the laser labels form.
 
The following changes are included in this patch:
 
Data dictionary changes:
===========================
New fields:
1. PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7), WARNING LABEL SOURCE field (#16)
The new warning label processing is not fully functional until this field
is set to "N" for "New" in the Pharmacy System Parameters Edit [PSS SYS 
EDIT] option.
2. DRUG file (#50), NEW WARNING LABEL LIST field (#8.1)
If the default warnings for a drug are not sufficient, a custom list of 
warning numbers can be created and stored in this field.
3. DRUG file (#50), GENDER SPECIFIC LBLS ON ALL RX field (#8.2)
If the commercial data source has indicated that a particular warning 
only applies to one gender, then if this flag is null or "Y", the warning 
will print for all patients. If this field is "N", the warning will only
print for this drug when the patient is that specific gender.
4. RX CONSULT file (#54), WARNING MAPPING field (#2)
5. RX CONSULT file (#54), SPANISH TRANSLATION field (#3)
 
The last 2 fields in the above list will have some entries populated
automatically in a post-install routine with this patch. The mapping is
used for matching entries in the old RX CONSULT file (#54) with the
equivalent entry in the new WARNING LABEL-ENGLISH file (#50.625).
 
New options under the PSS Manager [PSS MGR] option:
==================================================
1. Warning Builder [PSS WARNING BUILDER] option allows the user to print a
copy of the old and new warning file entries and to choose various ways to
select drugs to review which warnings will print when the flag is turned
to use the new warning label source. It also allows the user to override
the default warning labels to create a custom warning label list for the
selected drug. This is done by specifying a list of warning numbers from
the old RX CONSULT file (#54) and/or the new commercial data source
warning file.
2. Warning Mapping [PSS WARNING MAPPING] option can be used to match an
entry from the old RX CONSULT file (#54) to the WARNING LABEL-ENGLISH 
file (#50.625) to aid in using the Warning Builder (to identify local
warnings that do not have an equivalent entry in the new commercial data
source). The user can also enter a Spanish translation for an RX CONSULT
file (#54) entry, if desired, but whenever possible, the new commercial
data source's warnings should be used.
 
Template changes:
=================
This patch modifies the DRUG file (#50) INPUT template [PSSCOMMON] to 
allow the user to view the new warning labels for a drug and edit the NEW 
WARNING LABEL LIST field (#8.1), if desired. For drugs that have a 
gender-specific warning associated with them, the new GENDER SPECIFIC 
LBLS ON ALL RX field (#8.2) will also be prompted.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch contains Application Program Interfaces (APIs) that will be 
used by calling applications that currently do direct global reads or 
writes to the Pharmacy Data Management files.  Since the PHARMACY PATIENT 
file (#55) and PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7) are being replaced as part of 
the Pharmacy Re-engineering project, any direct M-based global reads or 
writes to these files must be replaced by calling the APIs provided in 
this patch. When the new data source is in place, the calling 
applications will not be required to make any changes, because these APIs 
will be flexible enough to retrieve the requested data from the new data 
source, when the time comes.
 
These are the files that are affected. If any application is making 
direct global reads or writes to any of these files, they must be 
replaced by using the APIs exported with this patch.

 1. PSI-05-051:  A priority status of ASAP is not easily seen by the 
    finishing pharmacist.  A STAT order is displayed as blinking and 
    highlighted, but a ASAP order does not have any special visual
    effects.  
 
    In order to avoid adding more special visual effects to the screen 
    this patch is designed to provide two System Parameters that will
    allow the site a choice of what orders are sent to the PSJ STAT
    NOW ACTIVE ORDER and PSJ STAT NOW PENDING ORDER mail groups.
    The site can select STAT, ASAP, or NOW orders, or any combination of 
    the three for notification via the mail group functionality.
 
    This patch is adding two additional fields (parameters) to file 59.7, 
    PHARMACY SYSTEM FILE to enable the sites to select the priorities that
    will be used in the Inpatient Medications PENDING and ACTIVE order 
    notification software.  This will solve the reported problem in 
    HD98412 / PSI-05-051 by enabling the site to be notified when ASAP 
    orders are submitted by the physician.

1. The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0 has requested a 
new Application Programming Interface (API) from Pharmacy Data Management 
V. 1.0. The new API will allow CPRS to request the current status of any 
order for both Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 and Outpatient Pharmacy V. 
7.0. 
 
2. During internal testing, it was discovered that the Expected First 
Dose display in CPRS was inconsistent for PRN orders. If a provider 
checked the PRN box, no Expected First Dose is displayed. However, if the 
schedule selected had PRN in the name, an Expected First Dose is 
displayed which is not correct. This patch assists in correcting this
problem by modifying the TYPE OF SCHEDULE field (#5) in the ADMINISTRATION
SCHEDULE file (#51.1) to allow PRN. This information will then be provided
in an API to CPRS. PSI-05-026.

This project involves six different applications that have been significantly
changed to enable VA Medical Centers to perform third party electronic billing
for prescriptions. 
 
Below is a list of all the applications involved in this project along with
their patch number:
  
   APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH

   ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (AR) V. 4.5                      PRCA*4.5*230
   ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*1
 
Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) 
software applications and infrastructure were enhanced, in order to allow the
electronic transmission of outpatient pharmacy prescription claims (WINDOW and
MAIL fills) to third party payers via the network connections available
through the Austin Automation Center (AAC). VistA will be enhanced to receive
electronic adjudicated responses from the third party payers, which include
real-time processing for Drug Review Utilization and Refill Too Soon rejects.
Reject information will be displayed to the pharmacist as the prescription is
being processed. The pharmacist will have the capability to take the
appropriate action to ensure patient safety or to override the reject and
resubmit the claim to the payer for payment. When a status of "PAYABLE" is
returned by the payer for a released prescription, VistA will automatically 
create the bill in IB, authorize it and immediately create the receivable in
the AR application. Since the exact amount being paid by the payer is known,
a decrease adjustment will be automatically generated and applied so that the
receivable is equal to the net amount due from the payer.
 
The system also provides electronic payment matching capability (for
electronically billable outpatient pharmacy prescriptions) using the existing
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Lockbox functionality which processes other
electronic payments from third party payers. This real-time electronic claims
processing capability will be provided in accordance with the Healthcare
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), EDI transactions and 
the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) mandated format 
standards, specifically NCPDP Telecommunication Standard V. 5.1. Additional 
functionality delivered with this project includes: 
 
   . Auto-Release/Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI) Integration.
   . Back-billing capability to allow electronic billing of claims from within 
     the IB application.
   . Capability to MOVE a group of subscribers from one insurance plan to 
     another while automatically "expiring" the old plan, which is a major
     time saver.
   . Pharmacy Dispensed As Written (DAW) prescription processing.
  
Overview of the Process:
  
When a prescription is about to be filled and dispensed by the pharmacy, the 
OP application submits the prescription to the new ECME application. ECME then
contacts IB to verify whether or not the prescription is electronically
billable. If so, ECME gathers the information necessary to generate a NCPDP
claim. The claim information is passed to the VistA Health Level Seven (HL7)
package. The HL7 package then sends the billing information to the AAC, where
it is routed to the corresponding third party insurance via Emdeon (formerly
WebMD).
  
Once the payer processes the information, the response coming back from the
payer is passed back to the site that made the request, and the information
is stored in the ECME package. If the third party payer accepted the claim,
the adjudicated information is passed along to IB. If the claim was rejected
the problem can be worked on and a new claim can be submitted to the payer.
  
For electronically billable CMOP prescription processing, the third party
claim is sent before the prescription information is transmitted to the
CMOP facility to be filled. Once the adjudicating response is electronically 
received from the third party payer, if there are no Drug Utilization Review
or Refill Too Soon rejects, the prescription is then transmitted to the CMOP 
facility. When the CMOP center sends the dispensing information back to VistA,
the National Drug Code (NDC) information is checked against the NDC sent to 
the third party payer and, if different, a new claim is generated in the 
background and is sent to the third party payer. In case the CMOP facility 
indicates that it is unable to fill a "PAYABLE  prescription fill, a reversal
is automatically submitted to the third party payer for the corresponding 
fill.
   
This patch modifies PDM V. 1.0 to support the other applications in the
electronic claims generation process. It does not interface with the ECME
application at all. The changes to this application are the following:
 
1. A new multiple field has been added to the DRUG file (#50) to store the
   latest NDC numbers that have been dispensed at window as well as by CMOP
   for a specific division. This way, when the next prescription is entered by
   the division for the same drug, the last used NDC is automatically
   retrieved from this new multiple, stored in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and
   sent to the third party payer through ECME. Below is the multiple field and
   the fields under it:
  
     32  NDC BY OUTPATIENT SITE
         .01   OUTPATIENT SITE  
           1   LAST LOCAL NDC        
           2   LAST CMOP NDC   
     
2. A new field has been added to the DRUG file (#50) to store the DAW CODE
   field (#81). When a new prescription is entered for a specific drug, the DAW
   CODE from the drug is stored in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) for each fill.
   This field is solely being used for electronic billing purposes. It 
   communicates to the third party payer that a drug has a special 
   characteristic, which will hopefully prevent the payer from rejecting the
   claim. Below are all 10 existing DAW CODES:
 
     0 - NO PRODUCT SELECTION INDICATED
     1 - SUBSTITUTION NOT ALLOWED BY PRESCRIBER
     2 - SUBSTITUTION ALLOWED-PATIENT REQUESTED PRODUCT DISPENSED
     3 - SUBSTITUTION ALLOWED-PHARMACIST SELECTED PRODUCT DISPENSED
     4 - SUBSTITUTION ALLOWED-GENERIC DRUG NOT IN STOCK
     5 - SUBSTITUTION ALLOWED-BRAND DRUG DISPENSED AS A GENERIC
     6 - OVERRIDE
     7 - SUBSTITUTION NOT ALLOWED-BRAND DRUG MANDATED BY LAW
     8 - SUBSTITUTION ALLOWED-GENERIC DRUG NOT AVAILABLE IN MARKETPLACE
     9 - OTHER
 
   Note: The existing entries in the DRUG file (#50) will NOT be automatically
         populated with a DAW CODE value upon installation of this patch.
         However, the null value is automatically save as 0 (zero) - NO PRODUCT
         SELECTION INDICATED in a prescription entered for a drug with a null
         DAW CODE.
   
3. The Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option has been modified to allow
   the user to associate a DAW CODE to a drug in the DRUG file (#50). 
 
4. The Lookup into Dispense Drug File [PSS LOOK] option has been modified to
   display the DAW CODE field (#81) content for the drug being displayed.
   Below is the exact point where the DAW CODE is displayed:
   
   ...

This Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) patch is part of the Patient Financial
Services System (PFSS) project. PFSS patches are being released on various
schedules. Some patch functionality will not be active until a new PFSS
switch is activated during final implementation. PFSS will initially be
implemented at select pilot sites ONLY.
 
The purpose of the PFSS project is to prepare the Veterans Health
Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment for
the implementation of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) billing
replacement system. The project consists of the implementation of the
billing replacement system, business process improvements, and
enhancements to VistA to support integration with the COTS billing
replacement system. Significant changes to VistA legacy systems and
ancillary packages are necessary.
 
Some of the PFSS software components are not operational until the PFSS
On/Off Switch, distributed with patch IB*2*260, is set to "ON". The
ability for the local site to set the switch to "ON  will be provided at
the appropriate time with the release of a subsequent Integrated Billing
patch.
 
For more information about the PFSS project, review the documentation
accompanying this patch and refer to the following website:
http://vista.domain.ext/billreplace/.
 
 
Functional Description:
=======================
The Charge Description Master (CDM) is an industry standard financial tool
common to all commercial billing systems and used in virtually every
private hospital. The CDM is a comprehensive listing of all services
performed, drugs supplied, or supplies provided in a particular hospital
along with the value of those services/drugs/items, or charge amounts.
Each of these entries are represented by a Charge Code, and the Charge
Code is made up of a Department Code and Service Code. The Charge Code for
Pharmacy will be the department code 160 concatenated with the assigned
Service Code for the drug. The Department Code 160 will not be stored in
any files and the Service Code will be established/approved by a central
CDM Change Control Board (CCB). The implementation of the COTS billing
system requires the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68)/DRUG file (#50) to link the
service master Service Code to every Pharmacy prescription fill or refill.
For drugs that are not associated with an entry in the VA PRODUCT file
(#50.68), the approved Service Code must be populated by the user.
 
 
Technical Description:
======================
This PDM patch PSS*1*92 provides the following functionality needed to
support the PFSS project:
 
1. A new SERVICE CODE field (#400) was added to the DRUG file (#50).
2. The PSSCOMMON Input template was modified to accommodate the new
   SERVICE CODE field (#400) to be used with the DRUG ENTER/EDIT [PSS DRUG
   ENTER/EDIT] option for drugs that are not associated with an entry in
   the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68).
3. The Integration Agreement (IA) #4483 was modified to include the new
   SERVICE CODE field (#400).

This patch supports the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) 
standard which was adopted under the Healthcare Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) for pharmacy claims. This patch is one of six to be
released.  Three patches will be released in a KIDS multi-build distribution 
containing: BPS*1*3, PSO*7*247, and IB*2*342.  Three patches will be released
individually and they are: PRCA*4.5*247, PSX*2.0*62, and PSS*1.0*115.
 
Enhancements included in the release of the six patches are a new option that 
will enable the user to reopen a closed Electron Claims Management Engine (ECME)
claim; updates to the Rx Activity Log; and permanent storage of Claims activity 
information as reported by the ECME Billing Events Report.  
 
This patch restores the ability to edit the DAW CODE field through the Drug 
Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option in the Pharmacy Data Management (PDM)
application. This field was originally created by the patch PSS*1*90 (see item
#3) but was unintentionally removed by patch PSS*1*92.
     
The following input template is included in this patch:
 
  Template Name                   File Name (Number)

This patch contains updated Application Program Interfaces (APIs) that will 
be used by calling applications that currently do direct global reads or 
writes to the Pharmacy Data Management files.
 
The ORDERABLE ITEM STATUS TRACKER (#81) field has been added as a returned
data element for the PSS^PSS59P7 API on the Pharmacy System file (#59.7).
 
The ORIGINAL WARD (#9), OTHER PRINT INFO (#31) &amp; MED ROUTE (#132) fields 
were added to the PSS436 component of the PSS55 API on the Pharmacy 
Patient file (#55).  
 
The DIC^PSSDI API has been modified to allow drug selection with matches
to certain VA Classes that are passed to the call.
 
Classes to be included or excluded are to be set up in the PSSVACL array
within the DIC component.
 
For example, if only drugs with a VA Class of DX201 &amp; DX202 were to be
available for selection, the local variable array would look like this:
 
PSSVACL("DX201")=""
PSSVACL("DX202")=""
PSSVACL("R")="" - The "R" means only drugs with these classes will be
                  available for selection. If these classes were to be
                  excluded, the letter "P" would be used instead.
 
 
A new API was added to routine PSS51P1. The PSSDQ component displays all 
the entries in the Administrative Schedules file (#51.1).

This patch enhances an original Pharmacy Data Management API call 
DATA^PSS50.  By replacing FileMan calls with direct reads, data retrieval 
from the DRUG file (#50) speed has been greatly improved. Specifications 
for this API can be found in the Pharmacy Re-Engineering (PRE) API Manual.
 
This patch also enhances an original Pharmacy Data Management API call 
ALL^PSS51P2.  By replacing FileMan calls with direct reads, data 
retrieval from the MEDICATION ROUTES file (#51.2) speed has been greatly 
improved. Specifications for this API can be found in the Pharmacy 
Re-Engineering (PRE) API Manual.
 
Additionally, this patch introduces an API STATUS^PSS55MIS which requires
three parameters.  The set of codes for STATUS field in the PHARMACY
PATIENT file (#55) subfiles is returned. This API will invoke the
FIELD^DID Fileman call and data will be returned to the calling
application as specified in the FIELD^DID FileMan documentation. 
Specifications for this API can be found in the Pharmacy Re-Engineering
(PRE) API Manual.
 
Finally, this patch introduces CLINIC^PSS55MIS which requires three 
parameters. This API returns a clinic from the HOSPITAL LOCATION file 
(#44) based on a provided order number and patient DFN.  This API invokes 
the GETS^DIQ data retrieval call.  Specifications for this API can be 
found in the Pharmacy Re-Engineering (PRE) API Manual.

1. In response to a patient safety issue, the Computerized Patient Record 
System V. 1.0 was modified to no longer always use a default in the 
medication ordering dialog. Therefore, sites are required to enter a 
default in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7). However, in support 
of the previous business logic, a default of ORAL was not allowed. This 
patch changes this requirement and allows ORAL as a default medication 
route. HD 144208, PSI-06-063
 
2. In order to assist sites in assigning a new default medication route, 
a utility is provided to allow assignment of a route to multiple 
orderable items, based on the dosage form. A new menu option has been set 
up for this feature. The new menu option is [PSS ADD DEFAULT MED ROUTE] 
and will be removed in a future patch.

<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2007-06-27 22:13:07</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
As part of the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 Laser Labels Phase II project, 
a new commercial data source is utilized to provide warning label 
information. 
 
A parameter was provided by patch PSS*1*87 to turn on the new warning
label format. This is currently being used in association with printing
laser labels. However, since not all Consolidated Mail Outpatient
Pharmacy (CMOP) facilities are reprogrammed to receive the new format, a
new parameter is being added for turning on the new warnings for CMOP. And
another parameter is being added to turn on sending the new warnings to
the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI). This is to 
accommodate vendors who may need to make changes to receive the new 
warnings.
 
Currently the Bedford CMOP is the only CMOP not ready to receive the new
format.
 
Until the parameters are turned on, warning labels from the old RX CONSULT
file (#54) are used. When they are turned on, warnings from the WARNING
LABEL-ENGLISH (#50.625) or the WARNING LABEL-SPANISH (#50.626) file will
be used. When the parameters are turned on, the "Do not transfer" warning
label 20 from the old RX CONSULT file (#54) is automatically added, when
applicable, during label printing, transmitting to CMOP, or sending to
OPAI.
 
Example warning labels for a drug when the warning source is set to "New":
 
  Take medication on an empty stomach one hour before or two to the three 
  hours after a meal unless otherwise directed by your doctor.
 
  This drug may impair the ability to drive or operate machinery. Use care
  until you become familiar with its effects.
 
  CAUTION: Federal law prohibits the transfer of this drug to any person
  other than the patient for whom it was prescribed.
 
 
This patch is required by PSO*7*200 which will send the new warning label 
text to OPAI and by PSX*2*54 which will send the new warning label text to
CMOP.
 
 
The following changes are included in this patch:
 
Data Dictionary Changes:
=======================
New fields:
1. CMOP WARNING LABEL SOURCE field (#16.1) in the PHARMACY SYSTEM file
(#59.7).
 
The new warning label processing is not fully functional for CMOP until
this field is set to "N" for "New" in the Pharmacy System Parameters Edit
[PSS SYS EDIT] option. 
 
2. OPAI WARNING LABEL SOURCE field (#16.2) in the PHARMACY SYSTEM file
(#59.7).
 
The new warning label processing is not fully functional for the 
Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI) until this field is set to
"N" for "New" in the Pharmacy System Parameters Edit [PSS SYS EDIT]
option.
 
 
Routine Changes:
================
Routine PSSYSP was modified to prompt for the above new fields.
Example:
 
Select OPTION NAME: PSS SYS EDIT       Pharmacy System Parameters Edit
Pharmacy System Parameters Edit
 
PMIS PRINTER: L8150$PRT//

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch contains the second quarter enhancements for the Pharmacy Data 
Management V 1.0 package.  The following data dictionary additions are
included for PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7) and supports modifications made 
in Outpatient Pharmacy patch PSO*7*200.
 
1.  SCRIPTALK PRINT DEVICE MAPPING multiple (#47) - adds the capability 
to tie a ScripTalk printer to regular Pharmacy label printer(s) to 
control where the ScripTalk labels print for multi-divisions.  Multiple 
print devices may be mapped to a ScripTalk printer, and any device 
defined must have a subtype prefixed with "P-".  This prefix in the 
subtype indicates that the device is a printer.  If no data is defined in
this multiple, the ScripTalk printer tied to the division will be used.  
The use of this multiple builds upon existing ScripTalk functionality, so
a divisional ScripTalk device must be defined for the mapped device
functionality to work properly and to have a default device defined.
 
    a.  LABEL PRINTER TO BE MAPPED field (#.01) -  This field contains 
the Pharmacy label printer(s) that the ScripTalk device is mapped.  When 
the printer device defined in this field is selected as the Pharmacy 
print device by the user, ScripTalk labels will print on the 
corresponding mapped ScripTalk device.
 
    b.  SCRIPTALK DEVICE field (#.02) - This field contains the ScripTalk 
print device that will be tied to regular Pharmacy label device(s) 
defined in the "LABEL PRINTER TO BE MAPPED" field.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
With the deployment of Cache version 5, it was discovered that the short
lock timeout values could generate a lock failure. Patch DI*22*147, which
has already been released, provided a solution to resolve this issue and
future lock issues.
 
This patch instituted a new default lock timeout of three seconds based on
a global node setting of ^DD("DILOCKTM")=3.
 
In order to avoid the lock issue in Pharmacy Data Management, this patch
modifies all routines that currently use a lock timeout value of less than
3 seconds to check for the node ^DD("DILOCKTM") and to use the value
defined there, otherwise the lock timeout value is set to a default value
of 3 seconds.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. A site reported a problem with the medication route being blank on the
Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) V. 3.0 Virtual Due List. During
investigation of possible corrections for this, it was determined that
another issue needed to be addressed with how to determine when to prompt
for an injection site. This patch assists to correct these problems by
adding the PROMPT FOR INJ. SITE IN BCMA field (#8) to the MEDICATION
ROUTES file (#51.2). In addition, the new field has been added to the
input template PSS MEDICATION ROUTES. HD0000000166204, HD0000000164890,
PSI-06-152, PSI-06-158
 
2. During internal testing, it was discovered that there was a problem 
with the Application Programming Interface (API) handled by routine 
PSS55. This patch corrects this problem.
 
3. To assist Pharmacy in appropriately setting the new PROMPT FOR INJ. 
SITE IN BCMA field (#8), a search routine will execute when this patch is 
installed. The purpose of this routine is to look for all Medication 
Route abbreviations that contain ID, IV, IM, SC or SQ. A message with the 
subject of "PDM - Check Med Route Abbreviations" will be sent to the 
person who installs the patch.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The general purpose of this patch is to meet the requirements in support
of ePharmacy enhancements. This patch is one of five to be released. Three
patches will be released in the KIDS multi-build distribution BPS PSO IB
BUNDLE 2.0, which contains BPS*1*5, IB*2*363, and PSO*7*260. Patches
PSX*2*63 and PSS*1*127 will be released as stand-alone patches. Since
there is an implementation dependency between the multi-build distribution
and the stand-alone patches, PSX*2*63 and PSS*1*127 must be installed
prior to the installation of the multi-build. For more specific
instructions please refer to the installation steps provided in each of
the patches.
 
This patch modifies the Pharmacy Data Management V. 1.0 application as 
described below:
 
1. The following fields were added to DRUG file (#50) for determining
   metric quantity for electronic 3rd Party billing:
 
   a.  NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT field (#82) - Allows entry of EA for EACH, GR
       for GRAMS or ML for MILLILITERS.
 
   b.  NCPDP QUANTITY MULTIPLIER field (#83) - This field contains the 
       number that will be multiplied by the quantity in the prescription
       in order to determine the correct quantity to bill electronic 3rd
       party insurance companies.  Only products with an NCPDP DISPENSE
       UNIT of GM or ML should have a value different than 1 (one) in this
       field. Numbers between 0.001 and 99999.999 are allowed entry 
       into this field.
 
2. The two fields above will be auto-populated by a post-install routine,
   which will be executed when this patch is installed. Although the 
   majority of drugs will be updated with EA (EACH) for the NCPDP DISPENSE 
   UNIT and 1 (one) for the NCPDP QUANTITY MULTIPLIER fields, a large 
   number of drugs will be updated with GM (GRAMS) or ML (MILILLITERS). 
   Furthermore, some drugs will also have a number different for the NCPDP
   QUANTITY MULTIPLIER field. The post-install routine relies on a 
   built-in list provided by the National Drug File (NDF) group that 
   contains the necessary information for the update being performed. 
    
   Once this patch is installed, the user should be able to verify the
   auto-population results by running the following Fileman Print option:
 
 
       OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: DRUG// 
       SORT BY: GENERIC NAME// NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT  
       START WITH NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT: FIRST// 
         WITHIN NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT, SORT BY: GENERIC NAME  
         START WITH GENERIC NAME: FIRST// 
           WITHIN GENERIC NAME, SORT BY: 
       FIRST PRINT FIELD: GENERIC NAME;@  
       THEN PRINT FIELD: NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT  
       THEN PRINT FIELD: NCPDP QUANTITY MULTIPLIER  
       THEN PRINT FIELD: 
       Heading (S/C): DRUG LIST// 
       DEVICE: ;;999  UCX/TELNET    Right Margin: 80// 
  
 
3. For the DRUG ENTER/EDIT [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option, the PSSCOMMON 
   input template for DRUG file (#50) was modified to allow entry/edit of
   the NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT field (#82) and the NCPDP QUANTITY MULTIPLIER 
   field (#83). The following give additional information on definition 
   and validation of these fields:
 
   a.  When new drugs are defined, the values of EA for EACH and 1 (one)
       will be the default values for these new fields.
 
   b.  When the NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT is changed from one value to another, 
       the NCPDP QUANTITY MULTIPLIER will be defaulted to 1 (one) and a 
       message stating such will be displayed.  If the NCPDP QUANTITY
       MULTIPLIER field already contains 1 (one), no change will be made
       nor will a message be displayed.
 
   c.  When a valid value greater than or less than 1 (one) is entered for
       the NCPDP QUANTITY MULTIPLIER, a warning message will be displayed
       stating that typically a value of 1 (one) should be defined for
       this field.  Then the user will be prompted to continue processing
       thereby accepting the new value or to edit and view extended help
       text for the type of NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT selected. If the user
       elects to ^ (shift six) to exit the "Ok to continue (Y/N)" prompt,
       the system will default the NCPCP QUANTITY MULTIPLIER to 1 (one)
       and give a warning message stating such.
 
 
4. The LOOKUP INTO DISPENSE DRUG FILE [PSS LOOK] option was modified to 
   list the new NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT and NCPDP QUANTITY MULTIPLIER fields
   after the PRICE/DISPENSE UNIT field.

BCMA by storing the most recent text in an additional location. The 
comment will still be stored in the current location. It will also be in 
the MOST RECEMT FLAG COMMENT field (#129) of the NON-VERIFIED/PENDING file
(#53.1) which is exported in an Inpatient Medications V5.0 patch. For
active unit dose orders, it will be stored in the MOST RECENT FLAG COMMENT

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. In support of the project Inpatient Medications Requirements for 
the Special Focus Group Initial Request Analysis (IMR) Phase III, 
two changes have been made in the input template PSSJ SCHEDULE EDIT. 
First, if the schedule type is continuous and it is an odd schedule, 
the system will no longer allow the entry of administration times. 
Continuous, non-odd schedules will still require administration times.
 
2. The second IMR change for the input template is if the schedule type
is on-call, the system will no longer require a frequency.
 
3. In support of the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) GUI v27 
release, the validation of schedules from the GUI has been modified. 
The change was to allow day-of-week schedules to be entered in the 
format: day@schedule. Schedule, in this case, is an already defined 
schedule such as BID. So, now a day-of-week schedule may be entered as
MO-WE-FR@BID to signify you want to use the BID administration times 
on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
 
4. In support of CPRS GUI v27, a modification has been made to the 
list of available Medication Routes sent back to CPRS from Inpatient
Pharmacy when using the IV Dialog.  If there is one orderable item
in the order, Inpatient Pharmacy will return any default med route
that may be defined in the Pharmacy Orderable Item File #50.7 along
with any other med routes defined for the dosage form #50.606.  
Duplicate entries will be removed.  If there is more than one orderable 
item in the order, Inpatient Pharmacy will return a list of the common
med routes that match all orderable items.
 
5. In support of CPRS GUI v27, remedy ticket, HD0000000220080 - "^ in 
the Schedule field" was addressed.
  
Problem:
--------
Users are allowed to include an "^" in the schedule when placing an 
order in CPRS GUI.
  
Resolution:
-----------
Routine PSSGSGUI will be modified to disallow an "^" in the text of a
schedule.
 
6. The routine PSS0088 is being deleted with this patch.  The routine
was part of patch PSS*1.0*88, and was used simply as a tally routine
to identify medication routes that needed to be reviewed when the
functionality of PSS*1.0*88 was installed.  The tally routine's
functionality is no longer necessary, so the routine will be deleted.
 
7. In support of CPRS GUI v27, the array of schedules from the 
ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file #51.1 that is returned to CPRS for schedule
selection on an order is being modified.  Currently, a site can have
multiple schedules with the same name for the same package.  The array
of schedules presented for selection in CPRS GUI v26 only takes the
schedule with the lowest IEN number in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file
#51.1 if a duplicate exists.
 
With the changes in CPRS GUI v27, if there is a duplicate schedule,
and if one of them contains ward-specific admin times for the ward
location of the patient, the schedule returned for inclusion in the
array of selectable schedules in CPRS will be the one with the ward-
specific admin times.  If no duplicate has ward-specific admin times
for the ward location of the patient, the schedule with the lowest
IEN number will be returned.  If both (or more than one)
duplicate schedules have ward-specific admin times for the ward
location of the patient, the schedule with the lowest IEN number in the
ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file #51.1 will be the schedule in the array
returned to CPRS.

This patch addresses a request which support the Pharmacy 
Benefits Management (PBM) Extracts Enhancement #3 
project. In order to allow the retransmission of only those 
patients who have had demographic updates, Pharmacy 
Data Management V. 1.0 was modified to build an entry 
for re-transmission in PBM PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS 
file (#59.9) whenever the FIRST SERVICE DATE field (#.07) 
in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) is updated.

This patch adds a MUMPS style cross-reference to the FIRST 
SERVICE DATE field (#.07) in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55). 
When the FIRST SERVICE DATE field (#.07) is updated for a 
patient then the cross-reference is triggered and the patient 
is queued for transmission.

The following applications were also updated as part of the 
PBM Extracts Enhancement #3 project:

Description:
===========
 
This enhancement is an interim resolution approved by the Inpatient
Medications Workgroup and Pharmacy Legacy Quarterly Enhancement (PLQE)
User Group for Patient Safety Issue PSI 08-026, PSPO #852 as described in
Remedy Ticket HD233682. This patch will help mitigate incorrect medication
routes being displayed for selection in the Computerized Patient Record
System V. 3.0 (CPRS).
 
Problem:
--------
Currently, for unit dose orders and Outpatient Pharmacy orders, all
medication routes for the dosage form of the orderable item are being
displayed in CPRS as possible medication routes to be selected. Even if
an orderable item is to be given only Intramuscular (IM), the provider
sees a dropdown list to select a potentially inappropriate medication
route of Subcutaneous (SC) or Intravenous (IV).
 
Resolution:
-----------
This enhancement affects both Inpatient Medications unit dose orders
entered via the Inpatient Medications order dialog in CPRS as well as
Outpatient Pharmacy orders entered via CPRS. A new parameter will be added
to the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7) to support this functionality (see
below). With this parameter set to YES, CPRS order dialogs will display
only the default medication route for the orderable item in the medication
route selection list in CPRS if a default medication route is defined in
the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7). If there is no default
medication route defined for the orderable item, then the current
functionality will be retained and all possible medication routes for the
dosage form will be displayed to the provider for selection in CPRS.
Routine PSSJORDF will be modified for this enhancement.
 
This enhancement adds the DEFAULT MED ROUTE FOR CPRS field (#80.7) to the
PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7) to support the functionality of this patch.
The field will serve as a toggle, allowing the site to choose whether they
want to implement the features of this patch in their system. This field
is maintained by the Pharmacy System Parameters Edit [PSS SYS EDIT]
option. The default for this field is YES when first accessing this field
from this option. This field may be set to YES or NO. An example of
setting this to YES appears below.

            DESCRIPTION:     This field should be marked "YES" if the site
                             prefers the MED ROUTE field (#.06) in the
                             PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) to
                             appear as the default/only entry during CPRS
                             order entry. If no default medication route
                             is defined in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM
                             file (#50.7), then the routes from the DOSAGE
                             FORM file (#50.606) will display.
 
                             This field will affect only orders entered
                             via the Inpatient Medications dialog or the
                             Outpatient Medications dialog in CPRS. It 
                             will not impact IV Fluids entered via CPRS or
                             orders entered via backdoor Pharmacy.
 
           TECHNICAL DESCR:  Set of codes. "YES" to display only the
                             default med route in CPRS and "NO" to 
                             continue with the current functionality.
 
The following table summarizes the functionality of this patch.

                                    selection box.
 
Additionally, this patch will provide a new option called Default Med
Route For OI Report [PSS DEF MED ROUTE OI RPT] that will be added to the
Medication Routes Management [PSS MEDICATION ROUTES MGMT] menu. The site
can use this report to identify the current default medication route for
the orderable item. Here is an example of the report:

This patch will make some additional enhancements to the Pharmacy
Re-Engineering (PRE) V. 0.5 Pre-Release functionality that was released in
patch PSS*1.0*129. This patch also sends out four Vista Security Keys to
be used in the Pharmacy Enterprise Customization System (PECS)
Application, which will be released at a later date.
 
The enhancements to the Pre-Release functionality include:
                                  
1) A new PSS ORDER CHECKS Mail Group will be created upon installation of
this patch. This mail group will be used for various purposes, all
relating to the Pharmacy Re-Engineering (PRE) V. 0.5 project.
 
2) Data from the DOSE UNIT (#4) Field and the NUMERIC DOSE (#5) Field of
the LOCAL POSSIBLE DOSAGE (#50.0904) Subfile of the DRUG (#50) File will
be added as display elements to the Lookup into Dispense Drug File
[PSS LOOK] option and the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option.
 
3) A Vista Mail message will be sent to the PSS ORDER CHECKS Mail Group
when an update is made to the STANDARD MEDICATION ROUTES (#51.23) File by
the New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) process. This mail message will
include what was updated, and will also include any automatic mapping
activities that occurred from the MEDICATION ROUTES (#51.2) File to the
STANDARD MEDICATION ROUTES (#51.23) File.
 
4) The Request Change to Standard Medication Route [PSS MEDICATION ROUTE 
REQUEST] option has been changed to now refer the requestor to a web site
to make the request.
 
5) A new ADDITIVE FREQUENCY (#18) Field has been added to the IV ADDITIVES
(#52.6) File. This field will be used to provide a default value for the
Additive Frequency field in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) when
continuous IV orders with additives are entered. Data will be
auto-populated by a Post-Install routine for this patch, and this data
should be reviewed and edited as necessary. This new field can be edited
using the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option or the ADditives
File [PSSJI DRUG] option. These defaults will not start to appear in CPRS
until Pharmacy Re-Engineering (PRE) V. 0.5. A new IV Additive Report [PSS
IV ADDITIVE REPORT] option has also been added, and this report, in
addition to the current IV Solution Report [PSS IV SOLUTION REPORT] 
option, will now be located under the new IV Additive/Solution Reports
[PSS ADDITIVE/SOLUTION REPORTS] Menu option, which will be located under
the Pharmacy Data Management [PSS MGR] Menu option.
 
A Mail Message will be sent to the PSS ORDER CHECKS Mail Group and the
patch installer upon completion of patch installation.

The system shall validate for frequencies of 1 day (1440 minutes) or
less that the number of administration times equals 1440 divided by the
frequency.
 
2.  Schedule Edit Validation Two
The system shall validate for frequencies greater than one day (1440
minutes), that only one administration time is permitted.
The system shall present a warning message to the user if more than one
administration time is entered.
 
3.  Schedule Edit Validation Three
In Ward Administration Times field in the PSS SCHEDULE EDIT option, for
a schedule that has a Schedule Type of Continuous, the system shall
prevent a user from entering administration times to Odd Schedules, a
schedule whose frequency is not evenly divisible by or into 1440
minutes (1 day).
 
4.  Schedule Edit Validation Four
Add validation to TYPE OF SCHEDULE field in PSS SCHEDULE EDIT to remove
frequency from the schedule file entry if the TYPE OF SCHEDULE is
changed from CONTINUOUS to ONE TIME, PRN, ON CALL, or DAY OF WEEK.
 
5.  Schedule Edit Validation Five
In the PSS SCHEDULE EDIT option, the system shall prevent a user from
creating Day of Week (DOW) schedules that are not in the correct day of
week order.  The correct order is: SU-MO-TU-WE-TH-FR-SA.
 
6.  Modify VistA Help Text
The Help Text in Standard Schedule Edit was modified to add additional
text so the user is able to see the added constraints when entering
Administration Times.

This patch will correct the issues reported in:
 
1) HD0000000111095 - PSS WARNING BUILDER option fails to respond properly
   When using the VistA "Warning Builder" [PSS WARNING BUILDER] option
   and the user enters a ? or ?? for additional help information,
   the program returns very little help information.
 
2) HD0000000133036 - Drug Synonym triggers are inconsistent
   Drug Synonym triggers are inconsistent with those on the drug level.
 
3) HD0000000324175 - 6 Enter/Edit Dosages
   In the "Enter/Edit Dosages" option in Pharmacy Data Management, there
   is a problem with the BCMA UNITS PER DOSE prompt when editing a
   Possible Dosage. The BCMA UNITS PER DOSE prompt should only be given
   if the Possible Dosage Package field  is marked for Inpatient ("I"),
   and the Application Packages Use field for the drug contains a "I" or
   "U".  Currently the prompt appears twice if the Possible Dosage Package
   and Drug is marked for Inpatient, (and it should only appear once).
   When the drug is not marked Inpatient, The prompt appears only once
   when it should not appear at all.
 
4) HD0000000157266 - Synonym DUOU field does not allow for input of 
                     decimal
  The input template for DISPENSE UNITS PER ORDER UNIT (^DD(50,15)) 
  allows for the input of decimal values (e.g. 2.5).

This patch corrects a defect introduced by patch PSS*1*143 in the
Standard Schedule Edit [PSS SCHEDULE EDIT] option.
 
 
HD0000000419996 -  Admin times cannot be deleted from PRN schedules
via the Schedule Enter/Edit [PSS SCHEDULE EDIT] option.
 
Remedy Overview
---------------
HD0000000419996
 
Problem:
---------
Patch PSS*1*143 changed the Standard Schedule Edit [PSS SCHEDULE EDIT]
option to prevent the prompt for Admin Time from displaying when the
schedule's Type is PRN, making it difficult to remove the admin times
from existing PRN schedules. When the schedule type of an existing
schedule is changed from Continuous to PRN, the admin times are removed,
however, when an existing schedule with a schedule type of PRN is edited,
the admin times are not removed.
 
In addition, an inconsistency exists within the same option: at the
initial prompt for Schedule Type, entering or accepting a default of
"PRN", has no affect on the value of admin times.
However, after pressing Enter or Return to exit the Schedule Type
prompt, if an up-arrow, or caret "^", is used to return to the Schedule
Type field, then entering "PRN" or accepting the default of "PRN" the
second time the prompt is displayed does delete the admin times from the
schedule.
 
Solution:
----------
Change the Standard Schedule Edit [PSS SCHEDULE EDIT] option to delete
admin times from the schedule anytime "PRN" is entered, or accepted as a
default, at the Schedule Type field. For existing PRN schedules, admin
times may be deleted by re-entering "PRN", or accepting the default value
"PRN", at the prompt for Schedule Type.
 
Change the same option to make the Schedule Type prompt to have the same
effect on the schedule's admin times for the initial and all subsequent
prompts.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
This enhancement is an interim resolution approved by the Inpatient
Medications Workgroup for Patient Safety Issue PSI 08-025, PSPO #852
as described in Remedy Ticket HD233682.  This patch will help resolve
incorrect medication routes being displayed for selection in the
Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).
 
Problem:
--------
Currently, for IV orders, if there is more than one orderable item on the
order, no default medication route is being denoted as a default in the
CPRS selection list even if all the orderable items on the order share
the same default med route.
 
 
Resolution:
-----------
This enhancement for IV orders will denote the default med route in the
selection list in CPRS if all of the orderable items on the order have
the same default med route defined.  If one or more orderable items on
the order have different default med routes, the current functionality
will be retained, and no med route in the selection list for CPRS will be
denoted as a default.  Routine PSSJORDF will be modified for this
enhancement.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch is being released in preparation for the medication routes
enhancement patch PSS*1*159. This patch contains the following:
 
 - The MED ROUTE field (#.06) of the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7)
   is renamed DEFAULT MED ROUTE.
 
 - The POSSIBLE MED ROUTES multiple (#50.711) is added to the PHARMACY
   ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7). This multiple is pointing to the
   MEDICATION ROUTES file (#51.2).
 
 - The USE DOSAGE FORM MED ROUTE LIST field (#10) is added to the PHARMACY
   ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) with YES/NO values.
 
The above fields will be available when editing an existing or adding a 
new orderable item using the following options:
  - Edit Orderable Items [PSS EDIT ORDERABLE ITEMS]
  - Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT
  - Dispense Drug/Orderable Item Maintenance [PSS MAINTAIN ORDERABLE
    ITEMS]
 
The Default Med Route For OI Report [PSS DEF MED ROUTE OI RPT] option
is modified to include printing of the POSSIBLE MED ROUTES multiple.
 
In addition, a post install routine will run to update the USE DOSAGE
FORM MED ROUTE LIST field (#10) based on the value of the DEFAULT MED
ROUTE FOR CPRS field (#80.7) of the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7). The
USE DOSAGE FORM MED ROUTE LIST field (#10) will be exported with "YES"
for sites that have the DEFAULT MED ROUTE FOR CPRS field (#80.7) set to
NO. Otherwise, the USE DOSAGE FORM MED ROUTE LIST field (#10) will be

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch contains software modifications to the Pharmacy Data Management 
(PDM) V. 1.0 application to support the FDA Medication Guides project. The 
project objective is to allow pharmacy staff to retrieve the FDA Medication 
Guide for prescriptions that contain FDA approved information that can help
patients avoid serious adverse events. The FDA requires that Medication
Guides be included with certain prescribed drugs and biological products 
when the Agency determines that: 
 
 . Certain information is necessary to prevent serious adverse effects 
 . Patient decision-making should be advised by information about a known
   serious side effect with a product, or 
 . Patient adherence to directions for the use of a product is essential
   to its effectiveness. 
 
The features in the FDA Medication Guides project are being delivered in
incremental releases. This patch is part of the Increment 2 release. The 
features included in this release are:
 
 . Establishment of a Server Repository for FDA Medication Guides within 
   the VA network.
 
 . Updates to 900+ entries in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) to store the 
   corresponding FDA Medication Guide document name will be provided via
   the NDF Monthly Data Update patches.
 
 . Introduction of a PC based Java software component to enable the
   automatic retrieval of an FDA Medication Guide from within VistA. The
   software does not require any direct user interaction. It works as a 
   bridge between VistA and the PC where it is installed. The software 
   identifies a request from VistA for a specific FDA Medication Guide and
   automatically retrieves it from the Server Repository and displays to the
   user via the Internet Explorer browser. 
  
 . Introduction of a new option called Display FDA Medication Guide [PSN MED
   GUIDE] to the National Drug File V. 4.0 application for retrieving and 
   displaying the FDA Medication Guide for a specific VA Product.
 
 . Introduction of new functionality to the Patient Prescription Processing
   [PSO LM BACKDOOR] option in the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 application
   for retrieving and displaying the FDA Medication Guide for a specific 
   prescription.
  
Below is a list of all the applications involved in this release along
with their patch number:

The FDA Medication Guides project is expected to complete in three 
increments. Among other features, the next Increment will automate the 
printing of FDA Medication Guides for prescriptions dispensed by the VA
via Outpatient Pharmacy application when the prescription label is printed.
   
The following modifications are included in this patch (PSS*1*158):
   
  1. New Data Dictionary field added to PHARMACY SYSTEM (#59.7) file
 
  A new field called FDA MED GUIDE SERVER URL (#100) is being added to the
  PHARMACY SYSTEM (#59.7) file. This field will be used to store the FDA
  Medication Guide Web server URL which will be used in conjunction with
  the FDA MED GUIDE (#100) field in the VA PRODUCT (#50.68) file to compose
  the complete FDA Medication Guide URL for a specific VA Product entry.
  
  2. A post-install routine will run to set this new field with the value
  shown below, which is the current FDA Medication Guides web Server URL:
  
     http://vaww.national.cmop.domain.ext/FDAMedGuides/
  
  Note: Integration Control Registration (ICR) #2613 is being modified to
        include this new field in the list of fields that can be read by
        the National Drug File (NDF) application.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses the New Service Request (NSR) #20070434 to prevent
the inadvertent creation of supra-therapeutic possible dosages for high
risk medications during the dosage creation segment of Pharmacy Data
Management and National Drug File (NDF) updates.  The Pharmacy Data
Management V. 1.0 and the National Drug File V. 4.0 were modified
to satisfy the request. The NDF portion is addressed in patch PSN*4*262.
 
This patch has the following enhancements:
 
1. This enhancement utilizes three new fields that were added to the
   VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) as part of patch PSN*4*261. These fields will
   be used during the Match/Rematch process of the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS
   DRUG ENTER/EDIT] and the Enter/Edit Dosages [PSS EDIT DOSAGES] options
   to determine if possible dosages should be auto- created or not. The
   three fields are:
         - CREATE DEFAULT POSSIBLE DOSAGE field (#40)
         - POSSIBLE DOSAGES TO CREATE field (#41)
         - PACKAGE field (#42)
 
When CREATE DEFAULT POSSIBLE DOSAGE field (#40) is "YES", then the
existing functionality of auto-creating possible dosages will be retained.
When this field is "NO", it will be used in combination with the value in
POSSIBLE DOSAGES TO CREATE field (#41) to determine the auto-creation of
possible dosages.
 
The following conditions will apply when CREATE DEFAULT POSSIBLE DOSAGE
field (#40) is "NO":
 
   a. If POSSIBLE DOSAGES TO CREATE field (#41) is "NO", no possible
      dosages will be auto-created and the following message will be
      displayed:
 
     "Due to National Drug File settings no possible dosages were
      auto-created."
   b. If POSSIBLE DOSAGES TO CREATE field (#41) is "O", 1x possible dosage
      will be auto-created for the package specified by the new PACKAGE
      field (#42) and the following message will be displayed:
 
      "Due to National Drug File settings only one possible dosage will be
       auto-created.
       If other dosages are needed, create POSSIBLE DOSAGES or LOCAL
       POSSIBLE DOSAGES as appropriate."
 
   c. If POSSIBLE DOSAGES TO CREATE field (#41) is "B", 1x and 2x possible
      dosages will be auto-created for the package specified by the new
      PACKAGE field (#42).
 
2. This patch retires the Auto Create Dosages [PSS DOSAGE CONVERSION]
   option. This option is retired because, if it is run inadvertently, it
   will delete all existing "Possible Dosages" and "Local Possible
   Dosages" and will re-set the Possible Dosages back to NDF settings. The
   changes that were entered locally by the site for "Possible Dosages"
   and "Local Possible Dosages" will be lost. Upon patch installation,
   this option will be removed from the Dosages [PSS DOSAGES MANAGEMENT]
   menu.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch makes a change to the interface when order checks are sent from
VistA to the Medication Order Check HealthCare Application (MOCHA). When
Order Checks cannot be performed for any reason, a warning message is 
displayed to the user that order checks did not occur. There was an 
occurrence reported in a test account where Order Checks did not occur, 
but no message was displayed to the user. At the end of all the order
check processing, this patch will add an additional check to see if the
flag that indicates the success or failure of the order checks is set. If
it is not set, it will set the flag that will indicate to the calling
application that the message indicating order checks were not performed be
displayed to the user.
 
Additionally, any time order checks are sent through the interface for 
the PSS INTERFACE SCHEDULER job or as an individual user, certain fields 
are required numeric values. Is these fields are not numeric, the 
interface request will fail. This patch will check those fields and 
substitute a value if necessary. These fields are as follows:
 
DUZ (User's internal entry number) - the software will replace with 0.
Job Number - the software will replace with 0.
Station Number - the software will use the leading numerics, but if
there are no leading numerics, the software will replace with 0.

This enhancement, approved by the Pharmacy Legacy Enhancement (PLE) User
Group, will resolve Patient Safety Issue PSI-08-026/PSPO #852 reported in
Remedy Ticket HD233682.
 
This patch will help mitigate incorrect medication routes being displayed
for selection in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 3.0.
This enhancement affects Inpatient Medications unit dose orders, IV Fluids
orders, and Outpatient Pharmacy orders entered via CPRS orders dialog.
 
The pharmacy Integration Control Registration (ICR) #2418 is modified
to return appropriate medication routes for the orderable item (OI) in
CPRS ordering dialog with the following conditions.
 
Note: The fields referenced below are from the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM
      file (#50.7):
 
  1. ICR Modifications
   - Default Med Route
     It will be derived from the DEFAULT MED ROUTE field (#.06) if it's
     populated or from the POSSIBLE MED ROUTES multiple (#50.711) if it's
     populated with single entry and the USE DOSAGE FORM MED ROUTE LIST
     field (#10) is set to "NO."
 
   - Optional Med Routes
     The medication route selection list in CPRS will be populated with
     entries from the POSSIBLE MED ROUTES multiple (#50.711) if the USE
     DOSAGE FORM MED ROUTE LIST field (#10) is set to "NO." Otherwise, it
     will be populated from the medication routes associated with the
     orderable item's dosage form, which is the current logic.
 
  2. The logic for editing the medication route has been modified in the 
     following options:
     - Edit Orderable Items [PSS EDIT ORDERABLE ITEMS]
     - Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT]
     - Dispense Drug/Orderable Item Maintenance [PSS MAINTAIN ORDERABLE
       ITEMS]
 
     The software will now ensure that the DEFAULT MED ROUTE field (#.06)
     of the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) is either defined and/or
     at least one entry is defined in the POSSIBLE MED ROUTES multiple
     (#50.711) or the USE DOSAGE FORM MED ROUTE LIST field (#10) is set to
     YES so that the medication route selection during order entry is
     listed appropriately.
 
     Note: This patch will change USE DOSAGE FORM MED ROUTE LIST field
           (#10) of the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) from not
           required to a required field. In order to use the new
           functionality introduced in this patch, it is imperative that
           the user marks this field YES or NO. This field will be used to
           determine the medication route selection during order entry.
 
  3. The Pharmacy System Parameters Edit [PSS SYS EDIT] option is modified
     to remove the DEFAULT MED ROUTE FOR CPRS field (#80.7) of the 
     PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7) from the list of fields that can be
     edited.

When calls are made to the Medication Order Check Healthcare Application 
(MOCHA), a "Ping" type of call is made first to test the communication, 
and if that is successful, the subsequent order check call is made. If 
either call fails, the process is aborted, and a message is displayed 
indicating that order checks cannot be performed.
 
What this patch introduces is a "re-try" if either of these calls fail. 
After a three second hang, the call (Ping or order check) will be
attempted again, then if the same call fails a second time, the process
will be aborted with the message indicating that order checks cannot be
performed.
 
This patch also addresses an issue (in conjunction with patch PSO*7.0*379)
concerning Orderable Items that are flaggeed as Supplies. If an order 
check is to be performed on an order that only has an Orderable Item with 
no Dispense Drug, an attempt is made to find the best drug available that 
is matched to the Orderable Item for the order check. Currently, if the 
Orderable Item is marked as a supply, no order checks are performed. But 
if the Orderable Item has both Supply and non-Supply Items matched to it, 
order checks can possibly be performed on one of the non-supply items. 
This patch makes the change to look for non-Supply Items matched to the 
supply Orderable Item to perform the order checks on.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch is being released as part of Pharmacy Legacy Enhancements Fiscal
Year 2011 to address the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI) 
Enhancements. The Outpatient Pharmacy patch PSO*7*354 is also being released 
as part of this enhancement.
 
Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) facilities have moved to using multiple
vendors for automated medication dispensing systems to improve the efficiency
of outpatient pharmacy operations. The following enhancements were made to 
the Pharmacy Data Management software to allow any one division to have more 
than one Automated Dispensing Device (ADD) communicating with Veterans Health 
Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) through OPAI.
 
1.A new OPAI sub-file (#50.0906) was added to the DRUG file (#50). It gives
  sites the flexibility to define ADDs at the drug level. The sub-file 
  (#50.0906) contains the following new fields:  
     DIVISION  - This is the division associated with the ADD for the drug.
                 This field is a pointer to the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59).
     WINDOW    - This field is a pointer to the PHARMACY AUTOMATED DISPENSING
      DNS NAME   DEVICES file (#52.53). Orders with a route of WINDOW will be
                 sent to this ADD.
     MAIL      - This field is a pointer to the PHARMACY AUTOMATED DISPENSING
      DNS NAME   DEVICES file (#52.53). Orders with a route of MAIL will be
                 sent to this ADD.
 
 
2.  The Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option was modified to include
    the new fields as part of data entry.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-17.html">USER,SEVENTEEN</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch corrects a patient safety issue in which editing the IV 
ADDITIVES file (#52.6) and/or IV SOLUTIONS file (#52.7) using the Drug
Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option is problematic. The current
functionality needs to be changed to prevent erroneous matching with
Dispense Drugs. It is very easy to select the wrong item and incorrectly
change the PRINT NAME field (#.01) of the additives or solutions files.
Also, once an additive or solution is selected, it is unclear as to
whether or not the user is still selecting or editing.
 
This process has been enhanced by displaying the previously entered Print
Name as the default if only one is entered.
  Example:
    +------------------------------------------------------------+
    |    Select IV ADDITIVES PRINT NAME: ADDITIVE1//             |
    +------------------------------------------------------------+
 
If more than one Print Name were previously entered, the software will
display the list of all linked Additives and/or Solutions to select from
so an edit may be made. Example:
 
  Example:
    +------------------------------------------------------------+     
    | &lt;DRUG NAME&gt; currently linked to the following IV Additives:|
    |                                                            |
    |       1. ADDITIVE1                                         |
    |       2. ADDITIVE2                                         |
    |                                                            |
    |    Select 1-2 from list above or type 'NEW' to link        |
    |    to a new IV Additive:                                   |
    +------------------------------------------------------------+
 
The new enhancement will also allow the user to enter a new Additive or
Solution and link it to the dispense drug. The software will give the user
the choice to enter and link the dispense drug to a new Additive or
Solution as well as require a confirmation of the selected dispense drug
that will be linked to the selected Additive/Solution. 
 
  Example (Create new IV Additive and link to drug):
  +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | &lt;DRUG NAME&gt; currently linked to the following IV Additives:        |
  |                                                                    |
  |    1. ADDITIVE1                                                    |

  |    Select 1-3 from list above or type 'NEW' to link                |
  |    to a new IV Additive: NEW                                       |
  +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
 
The new enhancement will also create the new sub-menu Inpatient Drug 
Management [PSS INP MGR]. This sub-menu will be located under the 
Pharmacy Data Management [PSS MGR] menu and will include the following 
options:
 - ADditives File [PSSJI DRUG]
 - Dispense Drug Fields [PSSJU DRG]
 - Dispense Drug/ATC Set Up [PSSJU DRUG/ATC SET UP]
 - Edit Cost Data [PSSJU DCC]
 - EDit Drug Cost (IV) [PSSJI EDIT DRUG COST]
 - MARk/Unmark Dispense Drugs For Unit Dose [PSSJU MARK UD ITEMS]
 - PRimary Solution File (IV) [PSSJI SOLN]
 
 
In addition to these enhancements, an unrelated defect that was discovered
with the PSSIV ADD Input Template during testing was corrected in this 
patch. The error prevented valid ADMINISTRATION TIMES from being 
associated with the IV ADDITIVE as well as QUICK CODES associated with 
the IV ADDITIVE. The error was addressed by correctly validating the 
ADMINISTRATION TIMES fields using the same validation as is used in the 
ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1).

Special Instructions/Other Print Info
________________________________________
With this enhancement, Special Instructions and Other Print Info have been
modified to support an unlimited amount of text. The existing
functionality that copies the provider comments from the Computerized
Patient Record System (CPRS) to be copied into each field has been
retained, and an additional action has been added to optionally open a
word processing edit dialog after copying the provider comments into the
appropriate field (Special Instructions for Unit Dose, Other Print Info
for IV).
 
Special Instructions and Other Print Info may also be entered
and/or edited from within Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 order entry
options.
 
Prior to this enhancement, Inpatient Medications maximum character
length for Special Instructions was 180 characters and for Other Print
Info the maximum length was 60 characters. This enhancement resolves
Patient Safety Issues PSPO 42, 1466 / Remedy Ticket HD336419
- Comment lengths between CPRS and Pharmacy.
 
No Allergy Assessment
________________________
The No Allergy Assessment enhancement provides an interactive alert to the
pharmacist in Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 when no allergy assessment is
on file for the patient, and a method for the pharmacist to enter an
allergy assessment after receiving the alert.  A pharmacy intervention
is automatically created if the pharmacist chooses to not enter an
assessment.
 
The No Allergy Assessment functionality will be available at the
following options:
 
Delete Orders [PSJI DELETE ORDER]
Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE]
Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW]
Order Entry [PSJU NE]
Order Entry (IV) [PSJI ORDER]
Profile (IV) [PSJI PROFILE]
 
When a patient with no allergy assessment is selected from one of the
affected options, the following message will be displayed to the
pharmacist:
 
"NO ALLERGY ASSESSMENT exists for this patient! Would you like to enter
one now?"
 
 - If the pharmacist enters 'YES' at this prompt, they are prompted
   for allergy information.
 - If the pharmacist enters 'NO' at this prompt, a pharmacist intervention
   is created, with a type of 'NO ALLERGY ASSESSMENT'. The pharmacist is
   then prompted for Provider and Recommendation. A new Recommendation,
   'UNABLE TO ASSESS', has been created specifically  for this type of
   intervention.
 
This enhancement will address Patient Safety Issue PSPO 445.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-17.html">USER,SEVENTEEN</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 This patch makes three enhancements to Pharmacy Data Management (PDM)
 and re-introduces an option from PSS*1*129 as a "stand alone" option:
 
 The first enhancement adds a new menu option under the menu option
 entitled "PEPS Services" [PSS PEPS SERVICES]. This new option is entitled
 "Print Interface Data File" [PSS VENDOR INTERFACE REPORT]. This report
 prints entries from the VENDOR INTERFACE DATA file (#59.74). The user is
 asked for a date/time range and the report is sorted by the most recent
 downtime first.
 
 The second enhancement is a change to the menu option entitled
 "Print PEPS Services Setup" {PSS CHECK PEPS SERVICES SETUP]. Additional
 functionality is provided to the user with a device prompt to send the
 output to a printer device or they may choose to print to the screen.
 
 The third enhancement deals with the way entries in the DOSE UNITS file
 (#51.24) are displayed. Some of the entries in this file are composed
 of TallMan lettering (mixed case). Under the menu option entitled
 "Request Change to Dose Unit" [PSS DOSE UNIT REQUEST], if a user
 requests a change to an entry that is composed of Tallman lettering,
 previously, these entries did not collate as desired. Any entry
 composed of TallMan lettering is converted to uppercase when doing the
 lookup so that alphabetic sorting is maintained while still preserving
 Ta1lMan lettering. A Post-Install routine PSS164P is included to re-index
 the DOSE UNITS file (#51.24).
 
 The option "Find Unmapped Local Possible Dosages" [PSS LOCAL DOSAGES
 EDIT ALL] is exported and re-introduced as a "stand alone" option. The
 option loops through all Local Possible Dosages, identifies entries
 eligible for dosage checks that do not have data in the new Dose Unit
 and Numeric Dose fields, and prompts for data entry into these fields.
 It was purposely deleted with the install of MOCHA V1.0. It was thought
 that it was no longer needed. It is being exported at the request of
 the sites. It was found that some had not fully mapped their dosages
 completely and have since added new drugs to DRUG file (#50) as well
 as have unmatched some drugs to National Drug File (NDF).

      CPRSV29_PSO_PSD.
 
This is the Pharmacy Data Management patch (PSS*1*166) that provides
the following enhancements and will be in the KIDS distribution PSS_1_166.
 
1. This patch modifies Integration Control Registration (ICR) #3737 by
   adding the following two new Application Programming Interface (API):
   a. The API $$DETOX^PSSOPKI will return a "1" (one) if the drug name 
      contains "BUPREN", a detoxification drug or a "0" (zero) otherwise.
 
   b. The API $$OIDETOX^PSSOPKI is provided to CPRS to determine
   whether an orderable item has an associated detoxification drug.
 
2. This patch modifies ICR #3784 - API $$IVDEA^PSSUTIL1 to return the 
   specific CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE field (#19) code of the VA PRODUCT file
   (#50.68) or the specific DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) code of the DRUG
   file (#50) of the drugs tied to the Orderable Item.
 
3. Patch PSS*1*159 introduced an issue where the user was prevented from
   up-arrowing (^) to quit out of the template in the Edit Orderable Items
   [PSS EDIT ORDERABLE ITEMS] option. This patch resolves that issue by
   allowing the user to up-arrow out of the template.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-17.html">USER,SEVENTEEN</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch will address Patient Safety Issue PSPO00001088 and
New Service Request (NSR) 20110308 as well as defects introduced
by patch PSS*1.0*146.
 
1) When adding a new IV Additive to the IV ADDITIVES File (#52.6),
and the user is at the GENERIC DRUG prompt, there is no way
to exit from the prompt. The input does not allow the user
to use the caret (^) to exit. The code that was modified
in routine PSSVIDRG for patch PSS*1.0*146 changed the code
at the GENERIC DRUG prompt and introduced this issue.  Patch
PSS*1.0*174 will fix this problem by properly allowing the
user to exit the GENERIC DRUG prompt by using the caret (^).
 
2) Another issue addressed with this patch is the wording when the
User is linking an IV Additive to a Generic Drug at the 
GENERIC DRUG prompt in menu option ADditives File [PSSJI DRUG].  It was
unclear which drug name was the Additive and which was the
Generic Drug when selecting.  This patch will remove the 
uncertainty by clearly stating to the user which is the
IV Additive and which is the Generic Drug.  For example:
 
PRINT NAME: CEFAZOLIN// 
GENERIC DRUG: CEFAZOLIN SOD 10GM M/D INJ// CEFAZ
     1   CEFAZOLIN OPTH SOLN 50MG/CC  (15CC) 
     2   CEFAZOLIN SOD 10GM M/D INJ           AM115     
     3   CEFAZOLIN SOD 1GM INJ           AM115     N/F   
CHOOSE 1-3: 3  CEFAZOLIN SOD 1GM INJ         AM115     N/
 
You are about to change the GENERIC DRUG linked to this ADDITIVE.
ADDITIVE CEFAZOLIN is currently linked to 
GENERIC DRUG CEFAZOLIN SOD 10GM M/D INJ.
 
Are you sure you want to link ADDITIVE CEFAZOLIN
to GENERIC DRUG CEFAZOLIN SOD 1GM INJ? No//
 
3) This patch will also serve as the overall resolution to the
issue of ambiguous IV Additive strength when a pharmacist is
finishing an IV by adding a STRENGTH (#19) field to the 
IV ADDITIVES File (#52.6).  The new STRENGTH (#19) field
can be populated when adding a new IV Additive or when editing
an existing IV Additive via menu option ADditives File [PSSJI DRUG].
 
For example:
 
PRINT NAME: CEFAZOLIN// 
GENERIC DRUG: CEFAZOLIN SOD 10GM M/D INJ//       AM115
USED IN IV FLUID ORDER ENTRY: YES// 
DRUG UNIT: GM// 
STRENGTH: 1// ??
 
This field identifies the numeric amount of medication that is
provided by one unit-of-use for the identified product.
 
For example, if one vial contains 50 MG of medication, the
STRENGTH will be entered as '50'.  The DRUG UNIT of 'MG'
is populated by the DRUG UNIT (#2) field.
 
 
Whenever a lookup is performed on the IV ADDITIVES File (#52.6), the 
STRENGTH (#19) field will display next to the NAME (#.01) field
with the words "Additive Strength:" and then its value.
Additionally, the DRUG UNIT (#2) field will be appended to the
STRENGTH (#19) field.  If the STRENGTH (#19) field is not
populated for the IV Additive, the text "N/A" will display, and
the DRUG UNIT (#2) field will not display.
 
For example:
 
Select IV TYPE: PIGGYBACK.
Select ADDITIVE: CEFAZOL
     1   CEFAZOLIN         Additive Strength: 1 GM  
               IV ROOM ONLY
     2   CEFAZOLIN         Additive Strength: 2 GM  
               
     3   CEFAZOLIN PREMIX         Additive Strength: N/A  
               
CHOOSE 1-3:
 
4) Additionally, this patch makes a small enhancement to the display
of Quick Codes during the selection of an IV ADDITIVE during
order entry.  When a lookup is performed on an IV ADDITIVE, if there
are QUICK CODES defined for the IV ADDITIVE, the QUICK CODE
STRENGTH (#1) field and the USUAL IV SCHEDULE (#4) field from the
QUICK CODE Subfile (#52.61) will display next to the QUICK CODE.
If the QUICK CODE STRENGTH (#1) field is null, "N/A" will be displayed.
If the USUAL IV SCHEDULE (#4) field is null, "N/A" will be displayed.
 
For example:
Select ADDITIVE: CEFAZ
     1   CEFAZOLIN         Additive Strength: 1 GM  
               
       - CEFAZ1GM -        Quick Code Strength: 1 GM     Schedule: N/A
       - CEFAZ2GM -        Quick Code Strength: N/A     Schedule: BID
     2   CEFAZOLIN         Additive Strength: 2 GM  
               IV ROOM ONLY
     3   CEFAZOLIN PREMIX         Additive Strength: N/A  
               
CHOOSE 1-3: 
 
5) This patch will also enhance the capabilities of the IV ADDITIVES
File (#52.6) and IV SOLUTIONS File (#52.7) so that a user can enter
a new additive or solution that has the same name as an existing entry.
Previously, a Fileman workaround had to be used to enter an identically
named entry.  With this patch, if the user types in a name that already
exists in the file, they will first be presented with a list of available
selections.  If the user scrolls through the list without selecting an
entry, they will be presented with the prompt to add a new entry.
 
For example - IV ADDITIVES File (#52.6)
 
CHOOSE 1-2: 1  PSSJI DRUG     ADditives File
ADditives File
Select IV ADDITIVES PRINT NAME: TESTDRUG
  Lookup: PRINT NAME
     1   TESTDRUG         Additive Strength: 10 MG  
               
     2   TESTDRUG         Additive Strength: N/A  
     3   TESTDRUG         Additive Strength: 5 GM  
               
     4   TESTDRUG         Additive Strength: 12 GM  
               
CHOOSE 1-4: 
  Are you adding 'TESTDRUG' as a new IV ADDITIVES (the 77TH)? No// Y  
(Yes)
 
 
For example - IV SOLUTIONS File (#52.7)
 
Select OPTION NAME: PSSJI SOLN       PRimary Solution File (IV)
PRimary Solution File (IV)
Select IV SOLUTIONS PRINT NAME: 0.9% SODIUM CHLORIDE
  Lookup: PRINT NAME
     1   0.9% SODIUM CHLORIDE            250 ML                 
     2   0.9% SODIUM CHLORIDE            50 ML  
               
     3   0.9% SODIUM CHLORIDE            25 ML  
 
CHOOSE 1-3: 
 
  Are you adding '0.9% SODIUM CHLORIDE' as 
    a new IV SOLUTIONS (the 32ND)? No// Y  (Yes)
 
6) This patch will also allow the addition of identically named
IV ADDITIVES and IV SOLUTIONS from the DRUG ENTER/EDIT 
[PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option when linking an additive or solution
to the drug.
