<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1 SEQ #1</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1999-09-14 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch provides updates for the FileMan Delphi Components (FMDC). FMDC
is used by developers to access VA FileMan data from client RPC
Broker-based applications.
 
This patch provides the following enhancements and fixes:
 
- Delphi 4 support is now provided (in addition to Delphi 3)
- Source code is now provided for the FMDC components
- You can now derive custom components based on the FMDC components.
  Changes include making most procedures and functions protected instead
  of private, and referring to components by type rather than name.
- NOIS issue LOM-0799-60075 is corrected (server side error due to a
  string length problem).
- FMCheckBox components' display of retrieved null values as grayed-out
  checked values is corrected. It now displays them as unchecked. An
  invalid non-null text value will still appear as the grayed-out checked
  value.
  
THIS SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION INCLUDES THE SOURCE CODE FOR THE COMPONENTS.
WHILE THE SOURCE CODE HAS BEEN PROVIDED, IT SHOULD NOT BE ALTERED
DIRECTLY.  IF AN ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY IS NEEDED, DERIVE A COMPONENT
BASED ON AN EXISTING COMPONENT INSTEAD, TO PROVIDE THAT FUNCTIONALITY. IF
YOU THINK IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO A WIDE AUDIENCE, THEN SEND A SAMPLE TO
TSOPENVISTA@DOMAIN.EXT.
 
While this patch provides only provides code changes for developer's
client workstations, a build also is included for the server side so that
the patch number will appear in the package file. This build should be
installed on the server simply to insure that the patch is noted as
installed.
 
The software distribution includes:

Server Side:
============
 
1. Installing this patch has no impact on users on the system. It can be
   installed at any time.
 
2. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. Use this
   option to load the FMDC KIDS (Kernel Installation and Distribution
   System) build for this patch into a transport global on your system.
    
3. Once the FMDC KIDS build for this patch has been loaded into a
   transport global on your system, on the KIDS menu use the following
   option to install the patch:
           Install Package(s)   'FMDC*1.0*1'
                                 ==========
 
Client Side (Developers only):
=============================
 
The client side distribution should only be installed on workstations of
developer who wish to use FMDC. To install, please follow the installation
instructions in the most recent FileMan Delphi Components (FMDC)

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch provides a FMDC1_0RM.TXT (7,024 bytes) file for the FileMan
Delphi Components (FMDC). The readme file provides important information
on how to recompile FMDC whenever a new RPC Broker Development Kit (BDK)
is installed.
