<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses the issue of one-time meds showing up on the Virtual
Due List from previous movements and even previous admission.  As released
the VDL will search back 30 days for one-time orders and display them on
the VDL if there is no associated administration in the BCMA medication
log.  With this patch the VDL will now only go back as far as the current
movement eliminating one-time orders from showing up from previous
movements and admissions.

 Y2K Waiver Request ID#:  Y2KW0001        Y2K Waiver Status: Approved
        This patch may be installed during the Y2K Moratorium, either
        BEFORE 12/15/99 or AFTER 1/15/2000.
        This patch MAY NOT be installed between 12/15/1999 and 1/15/2000
        (the Y2K Lockdown Period).
 
 This patch contains 3 improvements.
 
 1. Sites that are scheduled to integrate with a primary site can begin
 printing the station number in front of the Internal Entry Number (IEN)
 on the ZEBRA barcode labels.  As released labels would print only the
 IEN as a barcode for the selected medication. After this patch labels
 will be formatted as SiteNumber-IEN if the parameter PSB DEFAULT BARCODE
 SITE is set to yes.
 
 2. Use a different server name for the monthly SAGG reporting. Sites will
 notice no change with the SAGG update.
 
   Old Server: KMP1-BCMA-SERVER@ISC-ALBANY.DOMAIN.EXT
   New Server: KMP90-BCMA-SERVER@ISC-ALBANY.DOMAIN.EXT
 
 3. Further enhancements were done so the One-Time medications do not 
 appear on the Virtual Due List by discontinuing the order without having
 to mark the order as 'Do Not Give'.
 
 *************************************************************************
 NOTICE: This patch is released prior to a Y2K Waiver and can only be
 installed in a TEST environment until a waiver is received.  Upon
 granting of the waiver a message will be sent to all sites informing them
 that this patch may be moved to live.

        BEFORE 12/15/99 or AFTER 1/15/2000.
Patch PSB*1.0*3 contains the following fixes:
 1. Problem: Orphan jobs were left running due to a disconnect in
    communication between the server and client.
    
    Corrective Action: Incorporate RPC Broker patch XWB*1.1*6 to allow
    orphan jobs to die.
 
 2. Problem: User input dates in VA Fileman format not accepted by BCMA.
 
    Corrective Action: BCMA was modified to accept and store user inputted
    dates in a VA Fileman format.
 
 3. Problem: The administration times report on the GUI Virtual Due List
    will only display a 24 hour period, even if a time range is selected.
  
    Corrective Action: The administration times report on the GUI Virtual
    Due List was made consistent to the administration times report on the
    CHUI by removing the administration time fields.
 
 4. If BCMA has been designated to be used for QA and testing purposes
    only, a notification will be displayed when starting BCMA.
 
 5. Problem: If the Client/Server clock variance was greater than the
    acceptable limit defined in the PSB Parameters, the Virtual Due List
    would display the PC time.
 
    Corrective Action: Server/Client clock variance corrected to display
    server time.
 
 6. Required functionality added: Means Test Check Alert.
   
 7. Mandatory Security Check - The Director, Health Information Management 
Headquarters, and VA General Counsel have requested modifications to patient
look-up functionality in VistA.  This request results from a grievance filed by
employees that cites non-compliance with the Employee Privacy Act System of
Records.  The citation states that employee Social Security Number(SSN) and
Date of Birth (DOB) data is presented without soliciting the information from
the system and without notification to appropriate site personnel that this
information has been accessed.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
Patch PSB*1.0*4 contains the following fixes:
 
1. Problem: An undefined error was generated when running the Medication
   Administration History (MAH) report.

   undefined variable, thus not generate an error.
 
2. Problem: The Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option does not print
   one-time orders.
 
   Corrective Action: The Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option will
   now print missed one-time orders on the report.

   entered.
 
   Corrective Action: The Stop Date prompt has been removed from the Due
   List.
 
4. Problem: BCMA did not accept a dosage which contained decimals
   (i.e.,0.01)
 
   Corrective Action: BCMA has been corrected to accept a dosage which
   contains a decimal.
 
5. Problem: Medications marked as "Do not give" and "Discontinued" are
   printing on the Due List.
 
   Corrective Action: Medications marked as "Do not give" and
   "Discontinued" will no longer print on the Due List.
 
6. Problem: When on-call's are chosen to print on  the Due List the
   report would print one-times. When one-times are chosen
   the report would print on-call's.
 
   Corrective Action: The Due List will now properly print one-times
   and on-call's.
 
7. Problem: The user is unable to document the administration of a
   one-time order through the Manual Medication Entry
   [PSB MED LOG ENTRY] option.
   The  message "Error: OKAY to give" 'press return to  continue or
   ^ to exit', would display. No further action can be taken
   at this point.
 
   Corrective Action: One-time orders can now be properly documented
   through the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG ENTRY] option.
 
8. Problem: Within the Edit Divisional Parameters [PSB PARAMETERS] option,
   "Allowed Mins Before Sched Admin" would allow the administration of a
   medication to be administered based on the minutes prior to an
   "Administration Time."
 
   Corrective Action: The functionality of the question has been changed
   to allow the administration of a medication based on the number
   of minutes prior to the "active time" of an order.
 
9. Problem: Within the Edit Log Medication [PSB MED LOG EDIT] option ,
   a nurse was unable to edit his or her own administration record if
   another nurse made an entry to that medication.
 
   Corrective Action: The Edit Log Medication [PSB MED LOG EDIT] option
   has been modified to allow a nurse to edit his or her own
   administration entries.
 
10. Problem: Within the Edit Divisional Parameters [PSB PARAMETERS] option
    the user was not able to determine which division they had signed on
    too.
 
    Corrective Action: The Edit Divisional Parameters [PSB PARAMETERS]
    option will now see the following message displayed: "You are
    currently logged onto Division: XXX", with XXX being the division
    you are logged onto.
 
11. Problem: On the GUI Virtual Due List (VDL) when the nurse administers
    a PRN medication, the previous four PRN administrations are displayed
    with the  message "Okay to administer - Brief Administration History"
 
    Corrective Action: The display message has been changed to now read
    "Brief Administration History".
 
12. Problem: On-call and PRNs medications would display on the GUI VDL
    even if they were not active.
 
    Corrective Action: The GUI VDL will not display an on-call or PRN
    order until it has become active.
 
13. Problem: Within the Label Print [PSBO BL] and Drug File Inquiry
    [PSB DRUG INQUIRY] options, the Drug selection would allow the display
    and selection of inactive drugs and those marked for other packages.
 
    Corrective Action: The Drug Selection prompt will only display
    active rugs and those marked for packages "I" and "U".
 
14. Problem: When attempting to run the Medication Administration Log
    [PSBO ML] option, an error is generated due to incomplete data.
 
    Corrective Action: The software has been corrected to not generate an
    error.
 
15. Problem: When running the MAH report, the initials of the nurse who
    administered a PRN, on-call and one-time do not print on the report.
 
    Corrective Action: The MAH report has been corrected to properly print
    the initials of the nurse who administered an PRN, on-call, and
    one-time.
 
16. Problem: When running the MAH report, one-time orders outside the date
    range are being printed.
 
    Corrective Action: One-time orders will display within selected date
    range on the MAH report.
 
17. Problem: If no action was taken on a one-time order, they would stay
    on the VDL for 30 days.
 
    Corrective Action: One-time orders with no action will now drop off
    the  VDL after 12 hours.

1.  Problem: Sites using the Robot Rx are having difficulty with 
    Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) reading the barcode.
    *If your site is not using the Robot Rx system, 
    please skip section 1.
 
    Corrective Action: The BCMA software has been modified to recognize 
    the Robot Rx barcode format. In order for BCMA to function with 
    Robot Rx, please follow the directions in the order listed below.
 
    1.1 The DRUG file #50 cannot contain a synonym that is 16 or 18 
        digits in length and begins with a "3". If matches to this 
        pattern exist, they must be changed to a different format. 
        Once these are changed, new synonyms matching this format 
        cannot be entered while using Robot Rx. To search for 
        possible matches in the DRUG file #50, please follow
        these steps.

       1.2 A new prompt "Using Robot Rx" has been added to
       Edit Divisional Parameters [PSB PARAMETERS]option.
       The user should answer Yes to thE question when they
       are now ready to use Robot Rx.
 
2.  Problem: Sites which are attempting to integrate are concerned that
    the current prompt "Include Site Number" within Edit Divisional 
    Parameters[PSB PARAMETERS] option may have duplicates numbers at 
    other sites.
 
    Corrective Action: The prompt "Include Site Number" has been changed
    to "Default Barcode Prefix". This will allow each site to enter in
    a one to five alphanumeric prefix instead of just the site's prefix.
 
3.  Problem: The GUI Virtual Due List (VDL) does not wrap the "Dosage",
    cutting off the dosage display.
 
    Corrective Action. The GUI Virtual Due List has been corrected to
    properly wrap the "Dosage".
 
4.  Problem: If a user defines a reason under Reasons a Med is
    given PRN, beginning with a numeric value, the GUI Virtual Due List
    would display the actual number of the reason, instead of the text.
    Please see NOIS HAM-0100-22249 for an example.
 
    Corrective Action: The GUI Virtual Due List has been corrected to
    properly display the PRN reason defined.
 
5.  Problem: Non-verified medications are printing on the Missed
    Medications Report.
 
    Corrective Action: The Missed Medications Report
    has been modified to exclude non-verified medications.
 
6.  Problem: When administering an injectable drug from the VDL, you are
    first prompted with the "Enter Quantity and Units" screen.
    Once this screen is completed, the "Injection Site Needed" screen
    appears. If you press cancel, the medication entry is logged as given
    and no injection site is filed with an entry.
 
    Corrective Action: The VDL has been modified to make injectable site
    a required field.
 
7.  Problem: An error "Exception Elist error in module VCLX40.BPL AT
    0001A9FS" is generated in GUI when the following scenario occurs.
    The user scans a drug that comes in 5mg doses and patient needs
    10mg dose. The user scanned the medication once, then used the
    touch screen to make the second check mark on the second dose.
 
    Corrective Action: The dosage screen has been modified to require the
    second dose to be scanned in, instead of manually marked.
 
8.  Problem: Scan a PRN that requires an amount to be entered such as an
    injection or a cream. The "Enter Quantity and Units" window comes up
    and the user enters the amount and hits enter. Next the "Medication
    Log" screen is displayed and the user then realizes they incorrectly
    entered the amount, so the cancel button is pressed. The "Medication
    Log" screen is displayed and says "Order Administration Cancelled"
    The user hits enter then scans the med again. The "Enter Quantity
    and Units" screen doesn't come up again, but skips straight to the
    "Medication Log" and keeps the quantity and units from the first scan.
 
    Corrective Action: When cancel is chosen, BCMA will now properly
    cancel out.
 
9.  Problem: There are inconsistencies when marking IV's
    as held or refused.
 
    Corrective Action: IV's can be marked as started, held or
    refused.
 
10. Problem: The Missing Dose Followup [PSB MISSING DOSE FOLLOWUP] option
    would not stop scrolling if more than 14 medications were present.
    This did not give the user the ability to select the appropriate dose.
 
    Corrective Action: The Missing Dose Followup [PSB MISSING DOSE
    FOLLOWUP] option will now properly scroll, allowing the user the
    ability to select a dose.
 
11. Problem: Within the Drug File Inquiry [PSB DRUG INQUIRY]option,
    if an inquiry is done on a drug that has 50 or more characters
    in the MESSAGE: field, the screen locks and the process needs to
    be stopped.
 
    Corrective Action: The Drug File Inquiry [PSB DRUG INQUIRY]option
    has been corrected to no longer lock up if text is greater than 50
    characters.
 
12. Modification: Display the initials and name of the nurse on the
    Medication Administration History (MAH) [PSBO MH] option.
 
13. Modification: The MAH now displays the status of "HOLD".
 
14. Problem: The Missing Dose Request [PSB MISSING DOSE REQUEST], option
    would allow the user to select an inactive drug.
 
    Corrective Action: The Missing Dose Request [PSB MISSING DOSE REQUEST]
    option has been modified to prevent the selection of inactive drugs.
 
15. Problem: When the administration time and the stop time for a
    continuous order are the same, the system would calculate the
    last dose as a dose to be given. Please see example below, were the
    last dose of 1900 was calculated because the stop time was 1900.
 
    (1)Orderable Item: MINERALS/MULTIVITAMINS TAB
         Instructions:
    (2)Dosage Ordered: 1 TAB                    (3)Start: 02/10/00  11:43
    (4)     Med Route: ORAL                     (5)Stop: 02/10/00  19:00
    (6) Schedule Type: CONTINUOUS               (7)  Self Med: NO
    (8)      Schedule: Q2H
    (9)   Admin Times: 01-03-05-07-09-11-13-15-17-19-21-23
   (10)      Provider: BUNNY,BUGS
   (11) Special Instructions: FOR 3 DOSES
    This order will display 4 doses on the VDL.
 
    Corrective Action: BCMA has been corrected to calculate the
    appropriate doses when the stop time and administration
    time are the same.
 
16. Problem: The scanner ready status was inconsistent.
 
    Corrective Action: The scanner status is in a ready status during
    most functions in BCMA.
 
17. Problem: The "Allowed Mins to Enter PRN Effect" prompt within the Edit
    Divisional Parameters [PSB PARAMETERS] option was being stored
    incorrectly.
 
    Corrective Action: The "Allowed Mins to Enter PRN Effect" prompt is
    now being stored correctly.
 
18. Problem: An error occurred when cancelling the GUI BCMA log on.
 
    Corrective Action: The error has been corrected.
 
19. Modification: The full version number for BCMA GUI is now located in
    the About BCMA.
 
20. Problem: If a medication has a med route of intradermal, the injection
    site box will not appear on the VDL during administration.
 
    Corrective Action: The injection site box will now appear on the VDL
    when intradermal is the med route for a medication.
 
21. Problem: The following scenario would not generate the message ** NO
    SPECIFIED MEDICATIONS TO PRINT **" on the Due List. If a user
    choose to print the Due List for a specified schedule and there are no
    medications for that particular schedule, but other medications exist
    for other schedule types.
 
    Corrective Action: The report was corrected to properly display
 
    the message ** NO SPECIFIED MEDICATIONS TO PRINT **" when there
    are no medications to print for the specified schedule type.
 
22. Problem: Users are unable to identify old one-time orders on
    Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option.
 
    Corrective Action: The start date/date for a one-time order has been
    added to the Missed Medication Report.

Patch 6 contains the following modifications:
 
1.  Problem: The verifying nurse initials are not displayed on the Virtual
    Due List (VDL).
 
    Corrective Action: The VDL has been modified to display the verifying
    nurse initials.
 
2.  Problem: The "reason needed" field on the missing dose screen on the  
    GUI would allow freetext.
 
    Corrective Action: The "reason needed" field will not accept freetext.
 
3.  Problem: The "Last Given" column is updated each time an action
    occurs, including refused and held. This can be confusing to the
    user since a medication marked as held will also show a date and 
    time in the last given column.
 
    Corrective Action: The "Last Given" column will be changed to "Last
    Action". The last status will also be displayed in the column next to
    the date and time.

1. Installing Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) on a network
   drive.
 
   A. To install BCMA on a network drive, install BCMA on the file server
      that will perform the file sharing. BCMA is typically installed into
      c:\program files\vista\bcma.
 
   B. Perform a file search on the file server to locate the file
      roboex32.dll. Copy this file to the file server's BCMA directory.
      The file roboex32.dll is typically installed into the
      c:\windows\system directory or (for Windows NT machines)
      the c:\winnt\system32 directory.
 
   C. Share the BCMA directory on the file server.  Optionally, the
      directory can be set to READ ONLY via the shared directory
      properties. In a Windows NT environment, NTFS file
      security can be set to further secure this directory.
      Additionally, a login script file can be created that will
      automatically map the network drive each time a
      user logs in. This helps in the event that a user accidentally
      disconnects from the network drive.
 
2. Pointing the client PC/laptop to the file server.
 
   A. Map each laptop or client PC to the network drive mentioned in the
      previous step.
 
   B. Create an icon that points to the file bcma.exe (on the network
      drive). Via the icon's properties, set up the necessary command
      line parameters to connect to your VistA system.
 
Using this method, no BCMA files are required on the local client's PC.
When it is time to install the next BCMA GUI patch, have all users log out
of BCMA, install the patch on the file server that is sharing the files
and the upgrade will be complete.
 
The above installation instructions will only work with patch PSB*1*3 or
later.  Previous patches require additional files to be moved to the
shared BCMA directory.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Patch PSB*1*7 contains the following:
 
1.  Problem: An undefined variable PSBSTRT error is generated
    within the PRN Effectiveness List [PSBO PE] option when
    the user chooses a hospital location instead of a nursing
    location at the "Ward Location:" prompt.
 
    Corrective Action: The PRN Effectiveness List [PSBO PE] option
    has been corrected to not error if a hospital location is chosen.
 
2.  Problem: A user is unable to distinguish identical one-time
    orders on the Virtual Due List (VDL), when multiple identical
    one-time orders exist.
 
    Corrective Action: The pop up box, Multiple Orders for Scanned Drugs,
    will now display the Type, Active Medication, Special Instructions,
    Dosage, Schedule, Route, Admin Time, Last Action, and Start
    date/time for each order. To select the correct order for
    administration, highlight the order and then click the OK button.
 
3.  Problem: Users were unable to print reports to a slave device within
    all Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) CHUI options.
 
    Corrective Action: BCMA CHUI has been modified to allow the printing
    of reports to a slave printer.
 
4.  Problem: When entering an order through the Inpatient Order
    Entry [PSJ OE] option, for a drug that has a units per dose
    of 1, it is not necessary to manually enter a 1 in the
    "UNITS PER DOSE:" prompt. If the user chooses to bypass the
    "UNITS PER DOSE:" prompt field entry, the system will default
    to a 1. When the user elects to view the order detail on the
    VDL by double clicking on the order, the" Units" prompt
    is left blank.
 
    Corrective Action: The VDL has been corrected to properly display
    a 1 in the UNITS PER DOSE field (#.02), when a user views the
    detail order information.
 
5.  Problem:  The wording for the prompts listed below within menu
    Edit Divisional Parameters [PSB PARAMETERS] option were incorrect.
 
    Corrective Action: The following prompts have been changed in
    the PARAMETER DEFINITION file (#8989.51) in the DISPLAY TEXT
    field (#.02).
 
    From:                            To:
    Include Blank Addendums at end   Default prompt for INCL BLANKS &lt;Y/N&gt;
    Include Continuous Meds          Default prompt for INCL CONT &lt;Y/N&gt;
    Include IV Med Orders            Default prompt for INCL IV MEDS &lt;Y/N&gt;
    Include On Call Meds             Default prompt for INCL ON-CALL &lt;Y/N&gt;
    Include One-Time Meds            Default prompt for INCL ONE-TIME&lt;Y/N&gt;
    Include PRN Meds                 Default prompt for INCL PRN &lt;Y/N&gt;
    Include Unit Dose Med Orders      Default prompt for INCL UD MEDS&lt;Y/N&gt;
 
6.  Problem: Medication orders that have an ODD Schedule do not
    display on the VDL. An ODD Schedule is a schedule that is not
    evenly divisible by 24 hours (Q18H or Q7H).
 
    Corrective Action: BCMA has been modified to accept and display ODD
    Schedule types on the VDL.
 
    If your site plans on using ODD Schedules, please read the
    following NOTES.
 
    ***NOTE*** When ordering medications with an ODD Schedule,
    DO NOT enter a time into the "ADMIN TIMES:" prompt when placing an
    order within the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] option.
    BCMA will automatically calculate the administration time to the
    minute, based on the start date/time of the order. If you want the
    administration time to display to the nearest hour, edit the
    "START DATE/TIME:" prompt field to be on the hour.
 
    For example if the start time is at 0837 for a Q5H, the
    administration times will be at 0837, and at 1337. To display the
    order on the VDL on the hour, edit the start time to be at 0800.
 
    ***NOTE*** If a time is entered at the "ADMIN TIMES:" prompt when
    placing an order for an ODD Schedule, that administration time is
    when the medication will be displayed on the VDL everyday.
    For example, if an order is placed with a schedule
    of Q5H with an administration time of at 0900. The order will appear
    on the VDL at 0900 everyday. Do not enter administration times
    if you want ODD Schedules to function properly.
 
    ***NOTE*** ODD Schedules are NOT to be entered in the ADMINISTRATION
    SCHEDULE file (#51.1)
 
7.  Problem: No data is being displayed under the columns U/Ord and U/Gvn,
    within the medication log report when an IV is ordered.
 
    Corrective Action: The medication log report has been modified to
    display "N/A" in the two columns for IV orders.
 
8.  Problem: The Medication Administration History (MAH) report
    does not display the nurse's initials when a one-time is marked
    as refused.
 
    Corrective Action: The MAH report has been modified to
    display the nurse's initials when a one-time has been marked
    as refused.
 
9.  Problem: Within the Due List [PSBO DL] option, the "On Call:"
    prompt will not save the users settings upon exit.
    The field defaults to "No" after the user has exited the option.
 
    Corrective Action: The "On Call:" prompt has been modified
    to save the users settings upon exiting the option.
 
10. Problem: If a medication order has 2 or more units per dose, BCMA will
    display the Multiple Doses to Scan screen to allow the user
    to scan the second, third, etc doses. If a nurse enters an Internal
    Entry Number (IEN) for the second dose and did not press ENTER,
    but immediately pressed DONE, the IEN entered would not be marked as  
    Given.
 
    Corrective Action: Validation is now performed on any text entered
    in the "Scan Medication Bar Code" prompt, regardless if the user
    pressed ENTER or not.
 
11. Problem: If a user double clicks on an IV order on the VDL, the
    "Dosage Ordered:" prompt would display data.
 
    Corrective Action: The "Dosage Ordered:" prompt has been
    corrected to not display any data on the VDL if an IV is order.
 
12. Problem: If a patient has an IEN of "1" from
    the PATIENT file (#2) the VDL would generate the error
    "RPC ERROR GETORDERLIST" and not display any orders.
 
    Corrective Action: The VDL has been corrected to not error
    with a patient who has an IEN of "1".
 
13. Problem: If a medication is marked as held or refused through the
    Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option, the
    MAH report displays the entered date/time, not the
    administered date/time.
 
    Corrective Action: The MAH has been corrected to display the
    administered date/time instead of the entered date/time.
 
14. Problem: The Ward Administration Times [PSBO WA] option was
    printing medications for incorrect days. For example, if the
    medication had a schedule of MO-WE-FR and the report was
    printed on Tuesday, the medications for MO-WE-FR would print
    on the report.
 
    Corrective Action: The Ward Administration Times [PSBO WA] option
    has been corrected to properly print the medications for the correct
    days.
 
15. Problem: If BCMA is writing to the BCMA MEDICATION LOG file (#53.79)
    and an MAH is run a "NULLSUBSCRIPT" error is generated.
 
    Corrective Action: The code has been corrected by using
    standard coding conventions.
 
16. Modification: The "Room/Bed:" prompt has been added to the
    Missing Dose Request [PSB MISSING DOSE REQUEST] option.
 
17. Modification: The "MED ROUTE:" prompt has been added to the
    Due List [PSBO DL] option.
 
18. Modification: The ward location and room-bed have
    been added to the BCMA-Order Problem e-mail message.
 
19. Modification: The Enter PRN Effectiveness [PSB MED LOG PRN EFFECT]
    option has been modified to display the ADMINISTRATION MEDICATION
    field (#.08) from the BCMA MEDICATION LOG file (#53.79).
 
20. Modification: BCMA GUI has been modified to allow column resizing.
    Any changes to the column settings will be saved, allowing the user
    to re-enter the GUI to the saved settings. The original column
    settings can be reset through the Reset User Parameters
    [PSB USER PARAM RESET] option.
 
21. Modification: The Patient Medication Log in GUI has been modified to
    display the INCLUDE COMMENTS field (#.28) and the INCLUDE AUDITS
    field (#.29). All comments and audits are now viewable through the
    GUI.
 
22. Modification: The Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option and the Ward
    Administration Times [PSBO WA] option have been modified to
    not display self-medications.
 
23. Modification: The Medication Administration Log [PSBO ML] option
    has been modified to display the START DATE/TIME field (#10).
 
24. Modification: The ORDER NUMBER field (#.01) has been added to the
    Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option.
 
25. Modification: The Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option will only
    print one-time medications within the last movement date.
 
26. Modification: The BCMA GUI screen can now be maximized to fit the
    entire screen.
 
27. Modification: The Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY]
    option has been modified to display the history of the last four
    administrations for a PRN order.
 
28. Modification: The patient record locking functionality has been
    removed, allowing multiple sessions of BCMA to be opened for one
    patient.
 
29. Modification: New key functions.
 
                  Shift-Tab - Takes focus off the Scan Medication Bar Code
                  to the VDL, allowing the user to scroll up and down the
                  VDL orders. Press the Enter key to display a highlighted
                  order.
 
                  Right Click - on a selected order and select Display
                  Order to view detailed order information.
 
                  ALT-D,O - Displays detailed order information.
 
                  Select Due List [PSBO DL] option, then select
                  Display Order - To view detailed order information.
 
                  F4 - To view detailed order information.
 
                  F5 - Refresh the VDL.
 
                  CTRL,O - To open a new patient.
 
30. Modification: The GUI VDL has been modified to shut down when
    a "PSB GETORDERLIST" error is encountered. When such an error is
    encountered the VDL would display "No Active Orders". This information
    is a result of the broker returning no information. This modification
    prevents the user from viewing a VDL with false information when
    such an error is generated.
 
31. Modification: The GUI Broker has a timeout value called
    RPCTimeLimit as defined in the quoted text below:
 
    Description
 
    This property is a public integer property that is available at
    run-time only. It specifies the length of time a client will
    wait for a response from an RPC. The default and minimum value of
    this property is 30 seconds.
    If an RPC is expected to take more than 30 seconds to complete,
    adjust the RPCTimeLimit property accordingly. However, it is not
    advisable to have a RPCTimeLimit that is too long. Otherwise,
    the client-end of the application will appear to "hang", if the
    server doesn't respond in a timely fashion.
 
    The BCMA default has been changed from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.
    This can be changed with the new command line parameter of 'T' for
    timeout.
    Your command line might look as follows:
 
    "D:\Program Files\vista\Bcma\BCMA.exe" S=BGHAM P=9307 T=30
 
    Any value below 30 seconds will be disregarded.

Patch PSB*1*9 contains the following:
 
1.  Problem: The Virtual Due List (VDL) will only display the first
    additive and solution for an Intravenous (IV) order.
 
    Corrective Action: The VDL will now display all additives, strengths,
    solutions, and volumes for each IV order.
 
2.  Problem: The Room-Bed displaying on the Ward Administration Times
    [PSBO WA] option is a combination of data that consists
    of the ward location and the Room-Bed. When this combination of
    data exceeds 32 characters it causes the report to print skewed.
 
    Corrective Action: The ward location and Room-Bed will now print
    on separate lines.
 
3.  Problem: The "Missing Dose Printer" prompt did not display on the GUI
    BCMA Site Parameters.
 
    Corrective Action: The GUI BCMA Site Parameters has been
    corrected to display the "Missing Dose Request Printer" prompt.
 
4.  Problem: When BCMA generates an error message to pharmacy because it
    cannot determine the schedule. It displays the orderable item number
    instead of the name. Below is an example.
 
    Order Number....: 570U
    Orderable Item..: 1695  &lt;=====
    Patient.........: XXXXXX,SAMUEL  (000 00 0000)
    Reason..........: Unable to determine schedule 2X/WEEK
 
    Corrective Action: The error message has been corrected to display
    the orderable item name instead of the number.
 
    Order Number....: 570U
    Orderable Item..: DIGOXIN TAB  &lt;======
    Patient.........: XXXXXX,SAMUEL  (000 00 0000)
    Reason..........: Unable to determine schedule 2X/WEEK
 
5.  Problem: The following occurs when trying to print a Due List
    from the Due List [PSBO DL] option with a patient who has
    the same last name and last four digits of the SSN as another patient.
    When the last initial and last four digits of the SSN are entered
    it displays two choices.
 
    1  M6383  MOUSE,MICKEY       11-13-48    XXXXX6383
    2  M6383  MOUSE,MINNIE         4-3-36    XXXXX6383
    CHOOSE 1-2: 1
 
    The following question is then asked:
 
    There is more than one patient whose last name is 'MOUSE' and
    whose social security number ends with '6383'.
    Are you sure you wish to continue (Y/N)? Y
 
    When this question is answered, the Due List screen shifts down
    one line, skewing the screen.
 
    Corrective Action: The Due List [PSBO DL] option screen has
    been corrected to not skew when there is a multiple patient match.
 
6.  Problem: The user receives the following error message when
    attempting to start a PRN Piggyback. "Error(s) Filing Transaction
    MEDPASS. Business Logic Error: PRN Medications MUST Have a PRN
    Reason". The user is then unable to mark it as started.
 
    Corrective Action: The GUI VDL has been corrected to allow
    a user to mark a PRN Piggyback as started.
 
7.  Problem: User receives an undefined error when using the Missing Dose
    [PSBO MD] option.
 
    Corrective Action: The error was resolved by performing a KILL on the
    D0 variable.
 
8.  Problem: An IV order with a status of on call will not
    display on the VDL.
 
    Corrective Action: The VDL has been corrected to display IV's with
    a status of on call.
 
9.  Problem: When scanning a drug with more than 6 units per dose, only 6
    units display in the "MULTIPLE DOSES TO SCAN" GUI window.
 
    Corrective Action: The "MULTIPLE DOSES TO SCAN" window has been
    corrected to show and scan more than 6 units of a medication.
 
10. Problem: When a user leaves the "Print to DEVICE:" prompt blank
    within the Due List [PSBO DL] option the user receives a "NULL
    SUBSCRIPT"  error.
 
    Corrective Action: The "Print to DEVICE:" prompt has been changed
    to be a required prompt.
 
11. Problem: When a user deletes the date and time from an order already
    given within the Edit Medication Log [PSB MED LOG EDIT] option, the
    medication still appears as given on the Medication Administration
    History report (MAH).
 
    Corrective Action: The user is now able to mark a medication as
    NOT GIVEN at the "Admin Status:" prompt in the Edit Medication
    Log [PSB MED LOG EDIT] option and it appears correctly on the MAH.
 
12. Problem: Large volume IV's do not print on the Due List [PSBO DL]
    option.
 
    Corrective Action: The Due List [PSBO DL] option has been corrected
    to display large volume IV's.
 
13. Modification: Added the COMMENT field (#.3) from the BCMA MEDICATION
    LOG file (#53.79) to the Medication Variance Log [PSBO MV] option.
    E3R - 13732 and 14810
 
14. Modification: The message text the VDL displays when a patient has no
    orders have been modified. When there are no orders in VISTA for a
    selected patient the message, "No Active Orders at this Time" will be
    displayed. If there are orders in VISTA, but they do not fall within
    the start and stop times selected on the VDL the message,
    "No Meds to be Administered for the Time Period Selected!" will be
    displayed. If no schedule types are selected on the VDL the message,
    "No Schedule Type(s) Selected!" will be displayed.
    E3R - 14680
 
15. Modification: The process of Auto-update has been added to the BCMA
    functionality. Auto update is the process of automatically copying
    updated BCMA files from a server network drive to a client.
 
    The prompts "The UNC of the Auto-update Server" and "Autoupdate
    Notification Mail Group" have been added to Edit Divisional Parameters
    [PSB PARAMETERS] option.
 
    Please read the ReadMe.txt file found in your BCMA directory for a

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Patch PSB*1*10 contains the following:
 
1.  Problem: Orders with a day of the week schedule are generating
    false error messages to the due list error notification mail
    group. This occurs when the Virtual Due List (VDL) is opened
    on a day the order is not scheduled to be administered.
 
    For example, an order with a schedule of MO-WE-FR
    will generate an error message to the mail group if the
    VDL is opened on Tuesday.
 
    Corrective Action: BCMA has been modified to no longer
    generate an error messages to the due list error notification
    mail group when the VDL is opened on a non scheduled
    administration day.
 
2.  Problem: The patient's weight displayed in the patient
    demographic box on the GUI VDL was incorrect.
 
    Corrective Action: The calculation for the patient's weight has
    been modified.
 
3.  Problem: If a drug contains a future inactive date, the Label
    Print [PSBO DL] option will not print the drug.
 
    Corrective Action: The Label Print [PSBO DL] option has been modified
    to adhere to the future inactive date and print according to the date
    entered.
 
4.  Problem: When a medication has been given and then the dispense
    drug has been changed on the order, the VDL will display the
    new dispense drug on the already given medication.
 
    Corrective Action: The VDL has been modified to properly display
    any changes in dispense drugs on an order.
 
5.  Problem: User received an undefined error when altering a medication
    status in Edit Medication Log [PSB MED LOG EDIT] option.
 
    Corrective Action: The Edit Medication Log [PSB MED LOG EDIT] option
    has been modified to not generate an undefined error, by using
    standard coding logic.
 
6.  Problem: The Medication Administration History (MAH) [PSBO MH] option
    generates a null subscript error when the nurse or pharmacist initials
    are not present.
 
    Corrective Action: The MAH [PSBO MH] option has been modified to not
    generate an error when the nurse or pharmacist initials are not
    entered. The report will print without the initials.
 
7.  Problem: Orders which contain an odd schedule were not printing on the
    Missed Medications [PSBO MM], Ward Administration Times [PSBO WA]
    and the Ward Administration Times [PSBO WA] reports.
 
    Corrective Action: The reports have been modified to print
    odd schedule orders.
 
8.  Problem: The Last Action column on the Virtual Due List is not
    displaying the four digit year.
 
    Corrective Action: The Virtual Due List has been modified to display
    the full four digit year.
 
9.  Problem:  In reference to the Medication Variance Log [PSBO VR]
    option, a site noticed that this report indicates only the patient
    current ward location when the report is generated.  Although the
    patient may have received several administrations of medications on
    different wards, the report does not denote the patient specific
    location when the medication was administrated.  The lack of this
    information made it difficult for providers to track down the
    locations that had irregularities in the administration of medications
    to the patients.
 
    Corrective Action:  Modifications were made to the Medication Variance
    Log [PSBO VR] option to allow the report to display the patient
    location associated with each event date/time the medication was
    administrated to the patient.
 
 
10. Problem: Intravenous (IV) orders with a schedule of one-time
    generate a "Data Validation Error: 701: The value '.143022'
    for field ORDER ADMINISTRATION TIME in file BCMA MEDICATION LOG
    is not valid" error when trying to mark them as started.
 
    Corrective Action: BCMA has been modified to allow one-time
    IV orders to be marked as started without generating an error.
 
11. Problem: The VDL is displaying an incorrect message when a medication
    is marked as held. For example, when a medication is marked as held
    and the user tries to mark the next medication as given, the message
    "*** NOTICE, Aspirin was given 2 minutes ago" is being displayed.
 
    Corrective Action: The message has been updated to properly
    reflect the change in status. The new message displayed in the
    above example is;
 
    "*** NOTICE, Aspirin was HELD 2 minutes ago"
 
12. Problem: An undefined variable error is generated in the
    Missing Dose Report [PSBO MD] option when searching for
    an MAS ward.
 
    Corrective Action: The code has been modified to properly
    loop through the MAS ward locations and not generate an
    error.
 
13. Problem: If a patient has an 2 orders with the same orderable
    item and 2 different dispense drugs, the Ward Administration
    Times [PSBO WA] option will only print the first order on
    the report.
 
    Corrective Action: The Ward Administration Times [PSBO WA]
    option has been corrected to display both orders.
 
14. Problem: If the administration time and the Virtual Due List
    Parameters Start Time: are equal to 2400, the dose would
    not display on the VDL.
 
    Corrective Action: The VDL has been modified to properly display
    the 2400 medication.
 
15. Problem: An odd schedule order will only print the first two digits
    of the administration time on the Due List [PSBO DL] option.
 
    Corrective Action: Odd schedule administration times will now print
    military time on the Due List [PSBO DL] option.
 
16. Problem: If an odd schedule order calculates an administration
    time to be 2400. The GUI VDL will display "3030@3010" in the
    "Admin Time" column.
 
    Corrective Action: The calculated admin time for midnight dose
    will now properly display 2400 in the "Admin Time" column.
 
17. Problem: If an order contained an odd schedule greater than
    24 hours, the subsequent doses would not display on the VDL.
    For example, if an order has a schedule of Q36H only the first
    dose would display on the VDL.
 
    Corrective Action: BCMA has been modified to properly calculate
    the subsequent doses for an odd schedule greater than 24 hours.
 
18. Modification: The Label Print [PSBO BL] option has been
    modified to validate the drug requested for printing and the
    patient's current orders. If a drug is selected to print
    that the patient does not have a current order on. The
    following message will display
 
    "Patient not currently on medication: XYZ Med (Qty: 1)"
    Do you want to continue?
    E3R Number: 13809
 
19. Modification: When the user performs a right-click on the VDL,
    the Start IV status on the VDL has been modified to Start.
 
20. Modification: The GUI BCMA Site Parameters has been updated to include
    the following; Default Bar Code Format, Default Bar Code
    Prefix, Using Robot Rx, Allow Multiple Administration for On-Call,
    UNC of the Auto Update Server, Auto Update Notification,
    Default Prompt for INCL TRANSFERS, One Time Parameter.
 
    The Edit Divisional Parameters [PSB PARAMETERS] option will no
    longer be updated or maintained. All future enhancements and
    modifications will be made on the GUI BCMA Site Parameters.
 
21. Modification: The Missing Dose Request [PSB MISSING DOSE REQUEST]
    option was modified to prompt the user for the dosage schedule.
    In the BCMA MISSING DOSE REQUEST file (#53.68), the SCHEDULE field
    (#.19) has been added as a required field to store the schedule
    information.
 
22. Modification: The Missing Dose Report [PSBO MD] option was
    modified to display the dosage schedule.
    E3R Number: 13030
 
23. Modification: The Missing Dose Request [PSB MISSING DOSE REQUEST]
    option was modified to display the patient's social security number
    (last four digits), ward location, and room/bed information in the
    e-mail message sent to the missing dose notification mail group.
    E3R Number: 12780
 
24. Modification: Modified the right click 'Display Order'
    accelerator key to 'O' to match accelerator key on menu option.
 
    Modified the right click 'Drug IEN Code' accelerator
    key to 'D' to match accelerator key on menu option.
 
    Accelerator keys enable the user to access a menu command
    from the keyboard by pressing Alt+ the appropriate letter.
    E3R Number: 15291
 
25. Modification:  The (MAH) [PSBO MH] option has been modified
    to display an asterisk with the initial if a student
    administered a medication.  In the legend section on the MAH
    report, this asterisk will correspond to the student and the
    instructors initials, names, and date/time the medication
    was given.
    E3R Number: 14609
 
26. Modification: The (MAH) [PSBO MH] option has been modified
    to print an "***" in the date column when an order is discontinued.
    E3R Number: 13413/13852

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;15 SEQ #12</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2001-09-26 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
A problem was found in PSB*1*10 with how the Bar Code Medication
Administration (BCMA) Virtual Due List (VDL) processes orders with
certain schedules. Below are the listed problems found with PSB*1*10.
Please note: PSB*1*10 should not be removed. PSB*1*15 has been developed
to address these problems.
 
 
1. Problem: The Missing Dose Report [PSBO MD] option is generating an
   illegal number error when a user tries to run the report. This was due
   to the BCMA MISSING DOSE REQUEST file (#53.68) storing the external
   room-bed value.
 
   Corrective Action: The Missing Dose Report [PSBO MD] option was
   corrected by properly storing the internal room-bed value in
   the BCMA MISSING DOSE REQUEST file (#53.68).
 
2. Problem: Orders that contain administration times (0900-1500) as
   a schedule do not display on the VDL. When a
   user tries to access the BCMA VDL, a MailMan message will be sent
   to the Due List Error Notification Mail Group for the pharmacist
   to correct the order. The message that is generated is stated below:
   "No Admin time required for non-standard schedules."
 
   Corrective Action: The VDL has been corrected to properly display
   orders that contain an administration time (0900-1500) as a schedule.
 
3. Problem: When printing the Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option report
   by ward, there would be no truncation between data. This resulted in
   data overlapping, making the report unreadable.
 
   Corrective Action: To display all the data in a readable format, the
   Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option report has been modified by
   removing the ward location as a column. The ward location still
   displays as a header.
 
4. Problem: Orders that contain a standard day of the week schedule
   (i.e. MO-TU@0900) that are in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1)
   do not display properly on the VDL.
 
   Corrective Action: The VDL has been corrected to properly display
   standard day of the week schedules.
 
5. Problem: IV Piggyback orders that contain a standard schedule (Q8H)
   with no frequency defined in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file #(51.1)
   do not display on the VDL.
 
   Corrective Action: The VDL has been corrected to properly display these
   these types of orders.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;13</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2001-12-31 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. A site reported a problem where a one-time order could not be
 discontinued by the provider because it was expired due to the start and
 stop date being the same. However, the medication still displayed in Bar
 Code Medication Administration (BCMA) V. 1.0 because of the 12-hour rule 
 for displaying one-time orders on the Virtual Due List.  This patch
 corrects this problem by changing the way the one-time orders is
 calculated. There will be a ward parameter, system parameter and the
 standard calculation.  The hierarchy will be to check the one-time ward
 parameter first, if not defined, check the system parameter.  If the
 system parameter is not defined, the system will use the continuous order
 parameters to determine the stop date, rather than the start and stop 
 date being equal.  Then, when BCMA marks the medication as 'Given',
 Inpatient Medications will expire the order. NOIS# BUT-0501-20609.
 
2. Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option was generating a
 false Due List Error Notification message when accessed.
 
 BCMA V. 1.0 has been corrected to no longer generate an e-mail message.
 NOIS# NOP-0801-11096
       CTX-0801-72721
 
 This project consists of a master build containing three patches that 
 work together to accomplish these goals listed in order of install.
 Installation of this master build should be coordinated among the three
 packages affected since only one installation is necessary. The patches,
 in order of install, are:
 
       PSS*1*44  PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT V. 1.0
       PSJ*5*63  INPATIENT MEDICATIONS V. 5.0
       PSB*1*13  BAR CODE MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION V. 1.0

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Patch PSB*1*14 contains the following:
 
1.  Problem: The Enter PRN Effectiveness [PSB MED LOG PRN EFFECT] option
    did not properly refresh after entering an effectiveness past the
    allowed time.
 
    Corrective Action: The refresh command was added to the menu option
    to properly display the screen.
 
2.  Problem: In reference to the Missing Dose Request Report [PSB MISSING
    DOSE REQUEST] option, the dosage schedule was added to the report
    in PSB*1*10; however, each medication order was counted or
    displayed individually.  The sites would like the report to
    display a sum of identical medication orders.
 
    Corrective Action: Modifications were made to display the sum of
    medication orders that was identical and had an identical dosage
    schedule.
 
3.  Problem:  When a user selects to sort or print The Medication Variance
    Log [PSBO MV] option by ward, the report displays the variance
    information for all Wards.  The site would like the report to
    display only the variance information related to the Ward selected
    via ScreenMan.
 
    Corrective Action:  Modifications were made to the option to display
    only the variance information related to the selected Ward.
 
 
4.  Problem:  If the user enters in an old date (i.e. 1/21/1931), when
    running the Due List [PSBO DL] option, Bar Code Medication
    Administration (BCMA) generates an undefined variable error.
 
    Corrective Action: The Due List [PSBO DL] option does not generate
    an error when an old date is entered.
 
5.  Problem:  If an order was placed with a schedule of Q3MONTHS, it would
    display on the  Virtual Due List (VDL) everyday.
 
    Corrective Action: The VDL was corrected to display an order with
    a schedule of Q3MONTHS, once every 3 months.
 
6.  Problem:  The word missing is misspelled in the report header of the
    Missing Dose Followup [PSB MISSING DOSE FOLLOWUP] option. The header
    displays "Currently Unresolved Mising Dose Requests"
 
    Corrective Action: The misspelled word has been corrected.
 
7.  Problem:  The Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option report does not
    display the first dose for an odd schedule.
 
    Corrective Action: The Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option report
    has been modified to properly display the first dose for an odd
    schedule.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
1.  Problem: If a medication is marked from given to not given to
    given, the Medication Administration History (MAH) [PSBO MH] option
    would display these actions as three separate administration actions
    of given, not given and given.
 
    Corrective Action: The MAH will now properly display these three
    actions as one correct action.
 
2.  Problem: Version 2.0 beta test sites experienced errors in
    routines PSBMD and PSBVDLU1.
 
    Corrective Action: The errors experienced in those routines have
    been corrected.
 
3.  Problem: With the installation of BCMA version 2.0, routine PSBIPM was
    renamed to PSBAPIM.
 
    Corrective Action: PSBIPM is no longer being used in version 2 and 
    will be removed with this patch.
 
4.  Problem: With the installation of BCMA version 2.0, the Edit 
    Divisional Parameters [PSB PARAMETERS] option is no longer functional.
 
    Corrective Action: The Edit Divisional Parameters [PSB PARAMETERS]
    option will be removed with this patch. Any access to site parameters
    needs to be made through the GUI BCMA Site Parameters application.
 
5.  Problem: The Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option was generating
    the Due List Error Notification message, "No admin time required for a
    Non-Standard schedule," on expired orders.
 
    Corrective Action: The Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option will no
    longer generate the message "No admin time required for a Non-Standard
    schedule" on expired orders.
 
6.  Problem: When an order has a schedule in the day of week format, and
    had a frequency associated with it, the order was not displaying on 
    the Virtual Due List (VDL) on the days scheduled.
 
    Corrective Action: An order with a schedule in the day of week format
    and a frequency associated with it, will display correctly on the
    VDL on the days scheduled.
 
7.  Problem: The "Order Num" column was printing next to the "Medication"
    column on the Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option. This caused some
    confusion with the order number being interpreted as a dosage for
    some medications.
 
    Corrective Action:  The "Order Num" column was moved to be the
    first column on the Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option.
 
8.  Problem: The Edit Medication Log [PSB MED LOG EDIT] option allowed
    a medication patch to be marked not given from removed.
 
    Corrective Action: The Edit Medication Log [PSB MED LOG EDIT] option
    has been modified to not allow a patch to be marked as not given
    from removed.
 
9.  Problem: One-time orders with a future start date/time would print
    on the Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option.
 
    Corrective Action: The Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option has been
    corrected to only print one-time order when the order start date/time
    is within the report start and stop date/time.
 
10. Problem: IV orders with a future start date and time would display
    on the IV tab of the VDL before due.
 
    Corrective Action: The IV tab of the VDL has been modified to not
    display IV order until the order start date and time has been reached.
 
11. Problem: The GUI generated an error when attempting to display
    unit dose orders on the VDL.
 
    Corrective Action: The VDL has been modified to properly display
    unit dose orders on the VDL.

 Patch Description:
 ================= 
 
 Problem: In reference to the BCMA Print Label [PSBO BL] option, a problem
 was discovered in the drug validation process used to compare the 
 selected drug with medication orders listed for the patient. The drug 
 validate process was performed only if the system device was set to 
 BROWSER or the user device.
 
 Corrective Action: The BCMA Print Label [PSBO BL] option was modified to 
 perform the drug validate process before the device selection process.  
 Therefore, the drug validation process will be performed if the system 
 device was set to BROWSER or queued to a device.
 
 Problem: In reference to the BCMA Print Label [PSBO BL] option, a problem
 was discovered in the coding logic that created an entry in the BCMA 
 Report Request file (#53.69).  If the user canceled the label print 
 process as a result of a mismatch between the selected drug and patient, 
 an impartial or bogus entry would remain in the BCMA Report Request file 
 (#53.69) occupying vital system resources. 
 
 Corrective Action: The BCMA Print Label [PSBO BL] option was modified by 
 inserting the necessary coding logic to delete the impartial or bogus 
 entry in the BCMA Report Request file (#53.69) when the print label 
 procedure is cancelled as a result of a mismatch between the selected 
 drug and patient.
 
 Problem: In reference to the BCMA Print Label [PSBO BL] option, a problem
 was discovered in the ScreenMan data input functions.  If the selected 
 patient requires a Means Test, the option will abruptly display a message
 to the user indicating "*** Patient Requires a Means Test ***" and the 
 ScreenMan data input process was rearranged out of order.
 
 Corrective Action: The BCMA Print Label [PSBO BL] option was modified by 
 inserting the necessary coding logic to refresh the ScreenMan data input 
 screen when the Means Test notification message rearranged the data input
 process.  By refreshing the screen, the data input flow will return to 
 the next data input field.
 
 Problem: In reference to the BCMA Print Label [PSBO BL] option, a problem
 was discovered in the coding logic used to set a variable that contained 
 the internal entry number of the selected drug.  This problem was not 
 discovered in the initial release of BCMA V 2.0.
 
 Corrective Action:  The BCMA Print Label [PSBO BL] option was modified by
 inserting the correct coding logic to extract and store the selected drug
 internal entry number in the proper variable.
 
 Problem: In reference to the BCMA Print Label [PSBO BL] option, a problem
 was discovered in the drug validation process used to check the patient 
 medication orders. The option only validated medication orders that were 
 classified a Unit Dose and it did not validate medication orders that 
 were classified as IV orders containing IV Additives and IV Solutions.
 
 Corrective Action:  The BCMA Print Label [PSBO BL] option was modified 
 by inserting the proper coding logic to validate IV orders that contained
 IV Additives and IV Solutions.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Install this patch before installing Patch PSB*2*6. It will perform the
same medication order validation as Patch PSB*2*6, and allows Pharmacists
an opportunity to review "problem" medication orders before your site
installs PSB*2*6. Ensure that PSB*2*6 is installed immediately following
the correction of any problem medication orders. Failure to do so may
result in medication orders not displaying on the Virtual Due List (VDL).
 
The person installing this patch will receive two separate MailMan
messages with the following subjects:
 
BCMA Order Problem Notification Started on JAN 7,2003@08:24:18.
This will let the user know the date and time the process started.
 
BCMA Order Problem Notification Finished on JAN 7,2003@08:30:47.
This will let the user know the date and time the process finished.
 
The person installing this patch will also receive a MailMan message
with the subject: BCMA Pre patch 6 - Order Problem Notification. This will
let the user know that PSB*2*6 will have a problem displaying an order,
which is identified in the message text. A separate MailMan message
will be generated for each Order Problem.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
***NOTE*** Do NOT install this patch until you receive the message
"BCMA AADT X-REF CHECK COMPLETED" from the installation of PSB*2.0*9 and
the message "BCMA Order Problem Notification Finished" from the 
installation of PSB*2.0*18. Installing this patch before receiving these 
messages may cause the Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) program 
to error.
 
This patch contains changes to how BCMA V. 2.0 processes schedule
information from Inpatient Medications V. 5.0, and how it determines 
when to display a Continuous medication order on 
the Virtual Due List (VDL).
 
At the end of this installation a post install routine will clean up the 
BCMA Medication Log APATCH INDEX. The person installing the patch will be 
notified the routine has completed successfully via a MailMan email with 
the subject line "BCMA APATCH INDEX CLEAN HAS COMPLETED".
 
 
1.  Problem: The Medication Administration History [PSBO MH] option 
    displays medication orders beyond the requested report dates.
 
    Corrective Action: The Medication Administration History [PSBO MH] 
    option now displays medication orders within the requested report 
    dates.
 
2.  Problem: When a patient is discharged and reinstated, the MAH 
    displays "***" in the date column.
 
    Corrective Action: The Medication Administration History [PSBO MH] 
    option has been modified to not display "***" in the Date
    column for medication orders that have been discontinued and
    then reinstated.   
 
3.  Problem: PRN last actions listed as "Not Given" display on the
    Medication Log Information dialog box.
 
    Corrective Action: The last four actions of a PRN medication order
    will not display an action of "Not Given", in the Medication Log
    Information dialog box.
 
4.  Problem: A medication order for a Patch displayed multiple 
    times on the VDL, if it was marked as "Given", then "Not Given"
    and then "Given" again.
    
    Corrective Action: A medication order for a Patch will display 
    appropriately, regardless of how many times an action has been 
    applied to the associated patch order.
 
5.  Problem: After a patient receives a patch for the second time 
    the "Last Action" column on the VDL displays the incorrect date and 
    time.
 
    Corrective Action: The "Last Action" column will now display the 
    correct date and time for patches. 
 
6.  Problem: When an active IV order that has an infusing bag is edited
    through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), via the "CHANGE"
    action, the "old" order disappears from the BCMA VDL IV tab.  
    This prevents clinicians from knowing the status of the old order.
 
    Corrective Action: Continue to display the status of an edited IV 
    order on the BCMA VDL IV tab. 
       
7.  Problem: The Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option generates
    a "String too long" error message for medication orders that contain
    a schedule in a minute's format (i.e., Q2').
 
    Corrective Action: The Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option now 
    displays medication orders that contain a schedule using a minute's 
    format. 
 
8.  Problem: The Medication Administration History [PSBO MH] option 
    generates a "String too long" error message for medication orders 
    that contains a schedule in a minute's format (i.e., Q2').
 
    Corrective Action: The Medication Administration History [PSBO MH] 
    option now displays medication orders that contain a schedule using a 
    minute's format. However, schedules with a frequency of less than 45 
    minutes will display the message "Due Every # Minutes", where # is the
    frequency.
 
9.  Problem: Ward Administration Times [PSBO WA] option generates
    a "String too long" error message for medication orders that contain
    a schedule in a minute's format (i.e., Q2').
 
    Corrective Action: The Ward Administration Times [PSBO WA] option 
    now displays medication orders that contain a schedule using a 
    minute's format. However, schedules with a frequency of less than 30 
    minutes will display the message "Due Every # Minutes", where # is 
    the frequency.
    
10. Problem: Medication orders that include a Day of the Week schedule 
    generate a false Due List Notification Error on a day not due.
 
    Corrective Action: Medication orders that include a Day of the Week 
    schedule will no longer generate a false Due List Notification Error.
  
11. Problem: If a medication order with the dosage form of "PATCH" is 
    administered by a nurse using the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED 
    LOG NEW ENTRY] option, the medication will not display on the VDL for 
    the nurse to mark it as "Removed."
 
    Corrective Action: Medication orders with a dosage form of "PATCH"
    given by a nurse using the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW
    ENTRY] option will now display on the VDL for the nurse
    to mark them as "Removed." 
 
12. Problem: The Admin Time column on the IVP/IVPB tab of the VDL is 
    displaying administration times of "0000" for odd schedule orders.
 
    Corrective Action: The Admin Time column on the IVP/IVPB tab of
    VDL will now display the correct time for an odd schedule order. 
 
13. Problem: The data entered in the "Enter Quantity and Units" dialogue 
    box from the IVP/PB tab was not being stored in the medication log.
 
    Corrective Action: The data is now being properly stored in the
    medication log.
 
14. Problem: If a medication order is marked as "Not Given", the user is 
    unable to update the medication using the Manual Medication Entry 
    [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option.
 
    Corrective Action: The user will now be able to update medication
    orders that have been marked as "Not Given" using the Manual 
    Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option. 
 
15. Problem: If a PRN medication order with the dosage form of "PATCH" 
    was marked as "Given", it would duplicate on the VDL. The user was 
    unable to mark the medication as "Removed."
 
    Corrective Action: PRN medication orders with the dosage form of
    "PATCH" will follow the "PATCH" business rule.
 
16. Problem: The Ward Administration Times report displays IV orders with 
    admin times based on the frequency calculated by IPM. The display of 
    large volume IV's on this report is confusing to the user.
 
    Corrective Action: IV's with a IV type of Admixture, Hyperal, Syringe 
    Not Intermittent, Chemotherapy (Admixture), Chemotherapy (Syringe 
    Non-Intermittent) will not be displayed on this report.
 
17. Problem: A Schedule Type of "R" displays in the "Type" column on the 
    VDL for medication orders that have a dosage form of "PATCH" and 
    a previous Schedule Type of Fill on Request. 
 
    Corrective Action:  The correct Schedule Type will display in the 
    "Type" column on the VDL.
 
18. Problem:  A condition exists that causes a medication order to have
    the same previous and following order number. Because of this 
    scenario, the BCMA application is put into an infinite loop or may 
    cause an error when the VDL is opened.
 
    Corrective Action:  In support of several NOIS tickets regarding this 
    issue, BCMA has implemented a temporary fix that now allows a 
    medication order with the same previous and following order number to 
    display on the VDL. This is not a comprehensive fix, but will allow 
    BCMA to function properly while Inpatient Meds researches the problem.
    
19. Problem:  A one-time medication order marked as "Missing," 
    would not display on the Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option.
 
    Corrective Action:  A one-time medication order marked as "Missing,"
    will now display on the Missed Medications [PSBO MM] option.  
 
20. Problem: Day of the Week schedules that include the "@" sign followed 
    by a valid time do not display on the Virtual Due List.
 
    Corrective Action: Day of the Week schedules in this format now
    display correctly on the Virtual Due List.

For retrieval and installation instructions, please see the Client
Installation Instructions section.
 
1.  Problem:  Any order displayed as Provider Hold on the GUI Virtual
    Due List (VDL) is also marked as "Refused" when multiple medication
    orders are marked as "Refused."
 
    Corrective Action:  The GUI VDL will not apply the status of "Refused"
    to medication orders placed on Provider Hold when marking multiple
    medication orders.
 
2.  Problem:  Comments entered when a ward stock IV bag is completed
    and another ward stock IV bag begins infusing, are carried from one IV
    bag to another.
 
    Corrective Action:  Comments entered for an IV bag will not carry over
    to the next IV bag.
 
3.  Problem:  The error message "Missing Data" sporadically displays on
    the VDL when a user tries to administer a medication via the "CPRS Med
    Order" button.
 
    Corrective Action:  The "Missing Data" message has been corrected.
 
4.  Problem:  The error message, "'.' Not a valid integer" sporadically
    displays when a user accesses a patient record on the VDL.
 
    Corrective Action:  The VDL has been corrected to not generate the
    error message.
 
5.  Problem:  Any report printed from the GUI VDL, displays inactive
    wards in the "Ward" field under the "Print by" section.
 
    Correction Action:  Inactive wards will no longer be available for
    selection on reports printed from the GUI VDL.
 
6.  Problem:  A medication order with the dosage form of "PATCH" marked
    as "Given" using the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY]
    option, does not display on the VDL as "Given."
 
    Corrective Action:  Medication orders with a dosage form of "PATCH"
    marked as "Given" using the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW 
    ENTRY] option, will display on the VDL as "Given.
 
7.  Problem:  The "Provider:" field on the "Order Manager" dialog
    screen does not display all valid Providers when performing a partial
    lookup. This was a result of BCMA not validating the inactive date
    correctly.
 
    Corrective Action:  The code has been modified to perform the 
    validation on the inactive date. The correct Providers will display
    for selection under the "Provider:" field on the "Order Manager"
    dialog screen.
 
8.  Problem:  Drugs with a future inactive date were not available for
    printing on labels using the Label Print [PSBO BL] option.
 
    Corrective Action:  Drugs with future inactive dates are now available
    for printing on labels.
 
9.  Problem:  BCMA does not perform a version check between the GUI
    application and CHUI application side.
 
    Corrective Action:  BCMA will validate the version of the GUI 
    application  running on the GUI against the CHUI application.
    The client version must match the patch number on the VistA server,
    and if compatible, the previous GUI version will be allowed to run. 
    GUI version will be allowed to run.  No prior version will be allowed 
    to run on the client.
 
10. Problem:  The current "Typical" installation process for the BCMA
    GUI application installs both the BCMA client and the BCMA Site 
    Parameter application. This is not appropriate for an installation
    a ward P.C. 
 
    Corrective Action:  The "Typical" installation process has been 
    modified  to only install the BCMA client.
 
11. Problem:  The action of marking multiple medications, as "Held" or
    "Refused" does not always apply to every medication on the VDL. For
    example, if a medication is already marked as "Given", the action of 
    "Held" or "Refused" will not apply to that medication order.
 
    Corrective Action:  If multiple medications are highlighted on the 
    VDL, and the action of "Held" or "Refused" does not apply to
    a highlighted order, an Informational dialog box will display with
    the message, "Held or Refused will NOT be applied to the following
    order(s):" with a list of orders.
 
12. Problem:  The message "ERROR: MISSING DATA - ALL FIELDS ARE
    REQUIRED," Missing Field: NEEDED BY DATE/TIME," displays when a user
    selects the Missing Dose Followup [PSB MISSING DOSE FOLLOWUP] option, 
    to complete and save a request.
 
    Corrective Action:  The Date@Time Needed field on the "Missing Dose
    Request" dialog box is now a required field.
 
13. Problem:  The Right-Click feature used to access the "Take Action
    on WS" command was not available for a ward stock IV bag marked as
    "Held" on the VDL.
 
    Corrective Action:  The Right-Click feature used to access the "Take
    Action on WS" command is now available for a ward stock IV bag marked 
    as "Held" on the VDL.
 
14. Problem:  When users sign on to the BCMA GUI application, and are
    prompted to scan the patient's wristband, a lower portion of the 
    screen display is grayed out.
 
    Corrective Action:  The GUI screen display has been corrected.
 
15. Problem:  Reports would not print from the GUI application when
    print devices had the same name.
 
    Corrective Action:  The GUI printing function has been modified to 
    print reports to devices that have the same name.
 
16. Problem:  A medication order with a schedule of "AC&amp;HS," displays
    on the BCMA VDL with a schedule of "ACHS."
 
    Corrective Action:  The GUI has been modified to properly display the
    schedule.
 
17. Problem:  The shortcut keys of "ALT+A" used to display "Allergies"
    would go to the "Start Time:" field of the "Virtual Due List 
    Parameters:" section of the VDL.
 
    Corrective Action:  The shortcut key for "Allergies" has been changed
    to ALT-G.
 
18. Problem:  If a medication order is created or edited using the
    Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option or the Edit
    Medication Log [PSB MED LOG EDIT] option, the last action would 
    display incorrectly on the "Last Action" column of the VDL by
    dropping off any trailing zero of the time from the date/time format.
 
    Corrective Action:  The last action for a medication order will now
    display correctly under the "Last Action" column on the VDL.
 
19. Problem:  Users who mark a PRN medication order, with the dosage
    form of "PATCH" as "Given," cannot document a PRN effectiveness using
    the Enter PRN Effectiveness [PSB MED LOG PRN EFFECT] option.
 
    Corrective Action:  Users can now document a PRN effectiveness for a
    "Given" PRN medication order with a dosage form of "PATCH."
 
20. Problem:  Under the IV Medication Tab, if a medication order gets
    discontinued when a ward stock IV bag has a status of "Stopped," no 
    data would display under the "IV Bag Chronology."
 
    Corrective Action:  Data will correctly display under the "IV Bag
    Chronology" display area when an IV order becomes discontinued and a 
    ward stock IV bag has status of "Stopped" status.
 
21. Problem:  The Special Instructions pop-up box does not function on
    the IV Medication Tab when the Pharmacist enters an exclamation ("!") 
    to copy and flag the Provider comments for display in a BCMA
    message dialogue box.
 
    Corrective Action:  The Special Instructions pop-up box will now 
    display on the IV Medication Tab when a Pharmacist finishes
    an IV order and uses the "!" key to copy and flag the Provider 
    comments for display on the BCMA VDL.
 
22. Problem:  The "ALLERGIES:" bar on the VDL displays "No allergies on
    file" when no assessment was completed.
 
    Corrective Action:  The "ALLERGIES:" bar will now display  "No Allergy
    Assessment" if there are no allergies assessed and "No Known 
Allergies"
    if there is an allergy assessed, but no allergies.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 Problem: In reference to the Medication Variance Log [PSBO MV] option, a 
 functional discrepancy was discovered in the coding logic used to 
 extract previous variance information stored in the BCMA VARIANCE LOG
 file (#53.78).  The report will only show variance information related 
 to patients currently assigned to the selected ward.
 
 Resolution: Modifications were made to rebuild the data structure used 
 to sort, store, and display the variance information related to all
 patients associated with the selected ward stored in the BCMA VARIANCE
 LOG file (#53.78).
 
 Problem: In reference to the Medication Variance Log [PSBO MV] option, 
 several sites are experiencing problems with displaying variance 
 information as a result of incompatible ward names stored in the 
 BCMA MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78).  If the user selects a ward 
 name from the WARD LOCATION file (#42) that does not match the ward name 
 store in the BCMA MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78), the variance 
 log information will not display on the report.
 
 
 Corrective Action:  The Ward Name Conversion Process [PSB WARD CONV] 
 option was add to the Bar Code Medication Administration Manager 
 [PSB MGR] option to allow each site an opportunity to make the 
 appropriate corrections to incompatible ward, room and bed names stored 
 in their local BCMA MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78).  The 
 following functions are incorporated in the Ward Name Conversion Process
 [PSB WARD CONV] option:
 
 
 o  Allow the user to select a specified date range to control the amount 
 time needed to complete the process and the amount data that will be 
 changed.  
 
 o  Automatically, convert Ward Name to Ward IEN if the Ward Name in BCMA 
 MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78) is identical to the Ward Name in 
 the WARD LOCATION file (#42).  
 
 o  Display a list of un-identifiable ward names to the user.  
 
 o  Allow the user to change the un-identifiable ward name to a ward name

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;12 SEQ #16</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2003-05-20 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
NOTE: Patch PSB*2*12 makes changes to the ward-specific IV Parameters 
functionality included in the GUI BCMA Site Parameters application. 
Please be sure to read the Problem and Corrective Action statements below 
and coordinate the installation of this patch appropriately before 
installing it. (See suggestion at bottom of Corrective Action please.)
 
1.   Problem: The GUI BCMA Site Parameters application, IV Parameters 
settings for specific wards did function as required.  The IV Parameter 
settings for the "ALL" ward always affected the display of a patient's IV 
bags on the Virtual Due List (VDL), regardless of the settings for the 
patient's respective ward. 
 
Corrective Action: The IV Parameters settings for the "ALL" ward affect 
the display of a patient's IV bags VDL only when the settings are not 
defined for the patient's respective ward. Please be aware that after you 
install this patch, all ward-specific IV Parameters defined for wards 
other than "ALL" will work immediately. These parameters control when an 
IV bag is valid, and when BCMA warns a user   the status of an IV order 
has changed.   If your site has defined ward-specific IV Parameters, 
please review them BEFORE installing this patch, and notify the 
appropriate personnel to ensure that problems are not experienced once 
installed.
 
2.   Problem: The PSB DEFAULT BARCODE PREFIX Site Parameter was set to 
accept 1 to 5 characters so the user had to specify a prefix in the GUI 
Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) Site Parameters application. If 
none was specified, the barcode number was not recognized when the user 
scanned a patient's medication for administration.
 
     Corrective Action: The PSB DEFAULT BARCODE PREFIX Site Parameter has 
been set to accept 0 to 5 characters, so the user does not need to 
specify a prefix in the GUI BCMA Site Parameters application. When a 
barcode is printed, no prefix is added to the barcode so the label scans 
successfully during medication administration.
 
3.   Problem: Changes made to the IV Parameters when using the GUI BCMA 
Site Parameters application were not always being saved for the selected 
division.
 
     Corrective Action: Changes made to the IV Parameters when using the 
GUI BCMA Site Parameters application are now being saved for the selected 
division.
 
4.   Problem: When the unit of administration is a patch and that patch 
has a "Given" status, the BCMA Virtual Due List (VDL) displayed the last 
action date/time of the order in the "Last Action" column.  The VDL did 
not display the last action date/time of the orderable item.
 
     Corrective Action: When the unit of administration is a patch and 
the patch has a "Given" status, the BCMA VDL displays in the "Last 
Action" column the last action date/time of the orderable item.
 
 5.  Problem: Text in the "U/Gvn" column of the BCMA Medication Log 
Report did not provide word wrapping. This became apparent after 
free-text 'quantity and units' data was entered during the administration 
of a medication dose.
 
     Corrective Action: After entering free-text 'quantity and units' 
data during the administration of a medication dose, information in the 
"U/Gvn" column of the BCMA Medication Log Report will appropriately word 
wrap.
 
6.   Problem: The following is an example of an error that occurred when 
a user attempted to administer a unit dose medication with an "IV Push" 
med route:
 
    "^Error(s) Filing Transaction MEDPASS
     Data Validation Error: 701: The value 'KCL 20MEQ/D5/NACL {2}' 
     for field UNIT OF ADMINISTRATION in SOLUTIONS SUB-FIELD in file BCMA
     MEDICATION LOG is not valid."
 
The above error occurred under particular conditions associated with the 
IV solution. 
 
     Corrective Action: The user is able to administer unit dose 
medications with an "IV push" medication route, regardless of the IV 
solution.

1. Problem: The error message "Error(s) Filing Transaction MEDPASS" 
   displays when the infusion rate for an IV Piggyback order includes more
   than 30 characters.
 
   Correction: The INFUSION RATE field (#.35) of the BCMA MEDICATION LOG
   file (#53.79) was increased from 30 to 47 characters.
 
2. Problem: The Missing Dose Request [PSB MISSING DOSE REQUEST] option
   is creating incomplete entries in the MISSING DOSE REQUEST
   file (#53.68), when the user enters a "@" in the "Patient Name:" 
   prompt.
 
   Correction: The Missing Dose Request [PSB MISSING DOSE REQUEST] option
   has been modified to not create an entry in the MISSING DOSE REQUEST
   file (#53.68) file, when a user enters a "@" in the "Patient Name:"
   prompt.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Problem: If there is a continuous order, with an admin times, and 
the frequency is null, the GUI Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA)
does not display the order on the Virtual Due List (VDL) and a Due List 
Error Notification message is not generated.
 
Corrective Action: BCMA will generate a Due List Error Notification 
message for those continuous orders that contain a standard schedule 
with admin times and no frequency. This can also occur to non-standard 
Schedules. Pharmacy should review the problem order and make necessary 
corrections.
 
If a DUE LIST ERROR message is encountered with a Reason of "Invalid 
frequency received from order" please do the following.
 
1. Determine if the schedule listed in the mail message is in FILE# 51.1 
   the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE FILE. 
      a. If it is not, Log a NOIS.
      b. If it is, determine if the TYPE OF SCHEDULE is CONTINUOUS.
        i.  If it is not, log a NOIS.
        ii. If it is, determine if the frequency is a valid number 
            greater than zero.
              1. If it is, log a NOIS.
              2. If it is not, correct the frequency.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1.  Problem: The GUI Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) Site 
    Parameters application does not perform a version check between the 
    GUI application and the CHUI application.
 
    Corrective Action: BCMA will validate the version of the GUI BCMA 
    Site Parameters application running on the client against the CHUI
    application. The client version must match the patch number on the
    VistA server, and if compatible, the previous GUI version will be
    allowed to run. No prior version will be allowed to run on the client.
 
2.  Problem: The Medication History Report, which is available by 
    performing a right-click on an order from the BCMA Virtual Due List
    (VDL), displays incorrect data for an IV medication order. This occurs
    when an IV order contains more than one orderable item.
  
    Corrective Action: The Medication History Report will now display the 
    medication history for each orderable item contained in an IV  
    medication order.
 
3.  Problem: A user can administer multiple patches for an On-Call 
    medication order, with a dosage form of "PATCH," without the previous
    patch being removed.
 
    Corrective Action: For an On-Call medication order with a dosage form 
    of "PATCH," a user must first remove the previous patch administered
    before allowing any proceeding patches to be given.
 
4.  Problem: The administration times for a medication order that uses a 
    Day-of-the-Week schedule (i.e., MO-WE-FR@0900) do not print on the 
    MAH.
    
    Corrective Action: The MAH will now display the administration times 
    for a medication order containing a Day-of-the-Week schedule.
 
5.  Problem: The VDL generates displays an error if the user types  
    special characters (i.e., "^" or "?") when entering a comment for a
    medication order.
 
    Corrective Action: Any special characters entered with comments    
    will be removed when BCMA files the comment.
 
6.  Problem: The option "Take Action on WS" was removed in BCMA patch 
    PSB*2*20. This option allowed the user to change the status of a ward
    stock IV bag.
 
    Corrective Action: The option "Take Action on WS" has been added to  
    patch PSB*2*19.
 
7.  Problem: The new Reduced Space Symbology (RSS) bar codes contain the 
    National Drug Code (NDC) number in a new format called  "Global Trade 
    Item Number (GTIN)." The GTIN has a 14-digit data structure, which is
    used within the EAN.UCC System for the unique identification of trade
    items worldwide.
 
    Corrective Action: BCMA GUI will correctly read the GTIN and search   
    the SYNONYM field (#.01) of the DRUG file (#50) for a matching NDC
    number.
 
8.  Problem: The BCMA GUI Due List Report allows the user to select a 
    stop time that is prior to the start time.
 
    Corrective Action: The BCMA GUI Due List will not allow the user to 
    select a stop time that is prior to the start time:
 
9.  Problem: The MAH Report only displays the action of "Removed" for a 
    PRN, On-Call, and One-Time medication order with a dosage form of
    "PATCH."
 
    Corrective Action: The MAH Report will now display actions of 
    "Removed" and "Given."  for PRN, On-Call, and One-Time medication
    orders with a dosage form of "PATCH."
 
10. Problem: If an IV medication order has an infusing bag and becomes 
    expired, the infusing bag  continues to display on the VDL, along with
    the other available bags.
 
    Corrective Action: Available bags will not display when an IV     
    medication order becomes expired.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) will provide a visual
indicator on the Virtual Due List (VDL) to identify which schedule types
have active orders within the specified start and stop date/time for the
selected Medication Tab. A green "alert light" to the left of the
Schedule Type indicates that it has active orders for the specified
timeframe, and a gray "alert light" to the left of the Schedule Type
indicates that it has no active orders for the specified timeframe.
 
2. PRN medications will display on the VDL if the PRN Schedule Types
check box is selected in the GUI BCMA Site Parameters application. All
other schedule types will remain selected on the VDL by default when the
user opens a patient's record.
 
3. The VDL will display a BCMA Clinical Reminders marquee at the lower
right hand corner. The "count" is the number of PRN medications
without Effectiveness comments within the hours defined in the
"PRN Documentation" field on the Parameters tab of the GUI BCMA Site
Parameters application or within the current admission whichever is 
greater.
A mouse-over list displays the last four undocumented PRN orders.
When the user double clicks anywhere on the PRN Effectiveness row of
the BCMA Clinical Reminders marquee, the PRN Effectiveness Log dialog box
displays all PRN orders that need PRN Effectiveness and allowing
documentation of PRN Effectiveness comments for each order listed.
 
The "count" will update/refresh when the user:
a) opens a patient file.
b) administers a PRN medication order.
c) completes the documentation of a PRN Effectiveness.
d) refreshes the VDL.
 
A Med History button has been added to display the Medication
Administration History for the order selected.
 
4. When administering a PRN medication, the units given column
within the Last Four Actions table and a drop down box for the users to
select the PRN Reason have been added to the Medication Log dialog box.
Units given will not display for orders with multiple dispensed drugs.
 
5. An updated PRN Effectiveness Log dialog will ease the process of
PRN Effectiveness documentation. It displays a list of undocumented PRN
medications for a specific order, or across orders, including PRN 
medications from previous or expired orders. The dialog box
includes a "units given" column, which will not display units for orders
with multiple dispensed drugs. The division column has been removed.

***NOTE*** This patch should be discussed at each Department of 
Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMC) before being invoked. 
 
Problem: Sites are experiencing a large number of undocumented 
Pro Re Nata (PRN) effectiveness in the counter displaying under the
"BCMA Clinical Reminders" section of the GUI Bar Code Medication
Administration (BCMA) Virtual Due List (VDL). 
 
Solution: The Bar Code Medication Administration Manager [PSB MGR] 
menu contains the Documenting Backlog PRNs [PSB PRN DOCUMENTING] option 
which will allow a user to run a report for a date range that will 
search through the BCMA MEDICATION LOG file (#53.79) for all 
undocumented PRNs. The Documenting Backlog PRNs [PSB PRN DOCUMENTING]
option will automatically enter in a comment of "Administrative Closure"
for all undocumented PRNs identified by the report.
 
In accordance with M1, Part 1, Chapter 5, these blank sections of the PRN 
documentation will reflect the term "Administrative Closure" when the 
software is used to close these blank portions related to the PRN 
documentation. The sites medical record review committee should document 
the decision to run the patch to administrative close the undocumented 
PRN if the site chooses to use this option. In those cases where the sites
have reviewed the charts and find that the PRN documentation appears in
the patient record in other than the BCMA PRN field, the site should
individually enter "documented in progress note."
 
The person installing the patch will receive a MailMan message when
the process has completed. The subject line will read, "BCMA PRN
DOCUMENTATION Notification."

 5. Problem: NOIS ISB-1102-32339
 The Medication Variance Log [PSBO MV] option will only display variance
 information related to patients currently assigned to the selected ward
 on the BCMA Variance Log Report. The option will not display variances
 information associated with previous patients assigned to the selected
 wards.
 
 Corrective Action: The Medication Variance Log [PSBO MV] option will 
 rebuild the data structure used to sort, store, and display the variance 
 information related to all patients assigned to the selected ward stored 
 in the BCMA MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78).
 
 6. Problem: NOIS MWV-0102-23190 
 The Medication Variance Log [PSBO MV] option will not display variance
 information on the BCMA Variance Log Report when the user selects to
 print the report by ward names.  Several sites are experiencing this
 problem as a result of incompatible ward names between the BCMA
 MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78) and the NURS LOCATION file
 (#211.4).  In addition, sites should populate their NURS LOCATION file 
 (#211.4) with the proper ward name from the WARD LOCATION file (#42) to 
 prevent this problem from reoccurring.
 
 Corrective Action: The Medication Variance Log [PSBO MV] option will 
 compare the ward's internal entry number (IEN) stored in the BCMA 
 MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78) to the ward's IEN stored in the 
 WARD LOCATION file (#42).  The BCMA application will store the ward's IEN
 for future variances.  Site must use the new Ward Name Conversion Process
 [PSB WARD CONVERSION] option under the Bar Code Medication Administration
 Manager [PSB MGR] option to convert the ward name associated with 
 previous variance information stored in the BCMA MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG 
 file (#53.78) in order to print a BCMA Variance Log Report based on 
 previous variance information. 
 
 The Ward Name Conversion Process [PSB WARD CONVERSION] option is 
 temporary. However, in the future, Bar Code Medication Administration 
 patch PSB*2*23 will remove the temporary Ward Name Conversion Process 
 option from your system. The Ward Name Conversion Process option will 
 perform the following functions: 
 
 a. Allow users to select a specified date range, which will control the 
    amount of data and time needed to complete the process.
 b. Convert the ward's name to the ward's internal entry number (IEN) if 
    the Ward Name in BCMA MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG file (#53.78) is
    identical to the Ward Name in the WARD LOCATION file (#42).
 c. Display a list of un-identifiable ward names and allows the user to 
    make the appropriate corrections.

    does not display on the VDL; the message "No Active Orders" displays 
    instead.
 
    Corrective Action:
    If a patch is "Given" and not "Removed," it should display on the VDL 
    until it is marked as "Removed." A patch with the status of "Given" 
    will display on the VDL until it is marked as "Removed."
 
 
3.  Problem: NOIS ISB-0503-30409

    using the Edit Medication Log [PSB MED LOG EDIT] option displays the 
    message "Allowed status codes are Given, Not Given, Held, and 
    Refused," preventing the status change of the medication patch.
 
    Corrective Action:
    The Edit Medication Log [PSB MED LOG EDIT] option will allow the 
    status of a "Given" medication patch to be changed to "Removed."
 
 
5.  Problem: NOIS ISB-0703-30098
    The Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] allows the user to
    enter any administration status for any order type. For example, the 
    user can create a new BCMA Medication Log entry for a medication 
    patch order, with an administration status of "Completed." 
 
    Corrective Action:
    The Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] will only allow 
    the user to enter "Given," "Held," or "Refused" for orders which are 
    not IV  orders. A status for an IV order will not be allowed since IV 
    medications cannot be entered via this menu option.
 
 
6.  Problem: NOIS ISB-0703-30653
    The "Schedule:" prompt in the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW
    ENTRY] option screen displays the schedule type instead of the 
    schedule.

Patch PSB*2*30 presents some changes to the 'look and feel' of the Bar  
Code Medication Administration (BCMA) GUI. One change is the additive and 
solution display automatically for an infusing bag in the IV chronology 
section of the Virtual Due List (VDL).  Another change is during the 
administration of a Pro Re Nata (PRN) the PRN reason may be selected by 
typing the first letter of the PRN Reason.  BCMA will focus on the PRN 
Reasons that start with the first letter typed in the PRN Reason 
selection area.
 
 
1.    Problem: NOIS CPH-0703-40060
When an IV medication order becomes expired while an IV bag is 
"INFUSING" or "STOPPED," the un-administered bags of that order are still 
"available" for administration. 
 
Corrective Action:
When an IV medication order expires, the un-administered IV bags will not 
display on the BCMA VDL.
 
 
2.    Problem: NOIS RIC-0703-20366
The "Scanner Status:" indicator on the BCMA VDL displays red when the 
user switches from another application back to the BCMA GUI.
 
Corrective Action:
The BCMA VDL Scanner Status indicator will display green when it is 
possible to scan medication using BCMA. 
 
 
3.    Problem: NOIS ISB-0303-31005
Multiple IV bags of an order may be "INFUSING" simultaneously.  BCMA does 
not allow proper maintenance of any of these administered IV bags.  For 
example the user cannot "COMPLETE" any of the "INFUSING" IV bags.
 
Corrective Action:
BCMA will allow the maintenance of an order with multiple "INFUSING" IV 
bags.
 
 
4.    Problem: NOIS ISB-0703-31029
If the BCMA GUI user enters a space alone as documentation of PRN 
Effectiveness, an "information box" displays because the space is 
inappropriately treated as a special character.     
 
      Corrective Action:
When documenting PRN Effectiveness using the BCMA GUI via a lone space 
character, the lone space will not be treated as a special character; 
instead the user will be asked to re-enter the data.
 
 
5.    Problem: NOIS ISB-0703-30373
The user must scroll the list of output devices to select the most 
recently used print device.
 
      Corrective Action:
The print device most recently selected by the user will display first in 
the list of selectable print devices.
 
 
6.    Problem: NOIS ISB-0703-30480
Using the BCMA Site Parameter GUI application, the user can seemingly 
create an unlimited number of entries for a "Default Answer List" such as 
the BCMA "Injection Site" list .  These entries should then be selectable 
from the respective list box during certain medication administration 
using the BCMA GUI.  Without notice to the user, BCMA limits the number 
of entries/selections to 60.
 
      Corrective Action:
Using the BCMA Site Parameter GUI application, the user will be able to 
create up to 100 entries for a BCMA "Default Answer List" list box.  
Therefore it will be possible for the user to have up to 100 entries to 
select from the respective BCMA GUI list box.
 
 
7.    Problem: NOIS ISB-0703-30478
Using the BCMA Site Parameter GUI application the user can seemingly 
create entries for a BCMA "Default Answer List" box, such as the BCMA 
"Injection Site" list, longer than 30 characters.  Without notice to the 
user, BCMA limits the number of characters for a list entry to 30.
 
      Corrective Action:
Using the BCMA Site Parameter GUI application the user will not be able 
to create entries for a BCMA "Default Answer List" more than 30 
characters in length.
 
 
8.    Problem: NOIS ISB-0703-30290
Using the BCMA GUI, the user cannot submit a Missing Dose Request for a 
medication patch order when another patch from that order displays a 
status of "GIVEN" on the VDL.
 
      Corrective Action:
BCMA will allow the user to submit a Missing Dose Request for a 
medication patch order when another patch from that order displays a 
status of "GIVEN" on the VDL.
 
 
9.      Problem: NOIS ISB-0703-31421
When the user submits a Missing Dose Request for a PRN medication and 
immediately (without refreshing the BCMA VDL) marks that PRN as "GIVEN," 
BCMA files into the BCMA Medication Log a null value as the PRN Reason.
 
      Corrective Action:
BCMA will file into the BCMA Medication Log the PRN Reason as selected by 
the user for the respective PRN administration.
 
 
10.   Problem: NOIS SDC-0803-60738
When a Global Trade Identification Number (GTIN) bar code was scanned, 
BCMA would strip out the National Drug Code (NDC) number from the GTIN 
and perform a search on it. This would result in BCMA not finding a match 
and displaying the error message "Invalid Medication Lookup. DO NOT 
GIVE!!"
 
      Corrective Action: 
The logic that performs the lookup has been modified to not strip out the 
NDC number.       
 
 
11.   Enhancement: E3R#18328
BCMA GUI will allow a medication patch to be marked as "HELD" or 
"REFUSED" while another patch from the same order displays as "GIVEN" and 
not marked "REMOVED."
 
 
12.   Enhancement: E3R#13940
BCMA GUI will provide the user access to the BCMA Medication Variance Log
Report from the Reports menu of the VDL.

   applications that subscribe to BCMA Heath Level 7 (HL7) Messaging.  
   The events or transactions tht trigger the message broadcasts are
   MEDPASS, UPDATE, STATUS, ADD COMMENT, and PRN EFFECTIVENESS.  Upon the 
   completion of each "trigger event," BCMA will send HL7 version 2.4 
   compliant messages to COTS and other subscribing products or 
   applications. The BCMA HL7 interface must be activated after 
   installation for messaging to occur.
 
5. When the user launches the BCMA GUI application, the message box
   displays information regarding BCMA 508 compliance. This information
   can also be found in the BCMA Help, About dialog box.
 
6. When the user scans a currently infusing or stopped bag on the VDL IV
   tab and the associated order has had any changes made to it since the
   infusing or stopped bag's label was printed, the Scan IV box will 
   display Order changes including bag status and changes made on the 
   associated order.
   
7. A new column "Bag Information" has been added to the VDL IV tab. This
   column contains the administration status, date and time of the 
   currently infusing or stopped bag on its associated order and one of 
   the following messages if the order has changed since the bag label 
   was printed. "INFUSING bag on changed order" or"STOPPED bag on changed 
   order". This column is updated every time the patient record is opened 
   or the VDL is refreshed.

*** Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) Version 3.0 ***
 
This build consists of BCMA Version 3.0 rollover code and resolution to a 
few outstanding BCMA defects.
 
Listed below are primary National Online Information Sharing ticket 
(NOIS) identification information representing BCMA defects/problems
and their respective corrective action.
 
1. Problem: NOIS ISB-0603-31561
A medication order that has administration times set for today, but 
before the Start Time of the order, displays on the Bar Code Medication 
Administration (BCMA) Due List Report.
 
Corrective Action:
The Due List Report will not display medication orders until the Start 
Date/Time of the medication order takes affect.
 
2. Problem: NOIS ISB-0903-31964
When the user selects a time frame for the Medication Administration 
History (MAH) Report and no administrations are due, the report lists the 
medication order number from Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 under the 
"Initial-Name Legend" section.
 
Corrective Action: 
The MAH Report will not display the order number from Inpatient 
Medications V. 5.0 under the "Initial-Name Legend" section when no 
administrations are due for a specific time frame.
 
3. Problem: NOIS LAH-1203-61493
The user receives the following error message, "BCMA failed to 
communicate with VISTA," if the Graphical User Interface (GUI) BCMA times
out and is unable to connect to the server.
 
Corrective Action: 
The processing time for the GUI BCMA software to display the patient s 
record on the BCMA Virtual Due List (VDL) has been reduced.
 
4. Problem: NOIS LIT-0603-71923
Users sometimes receive an "allocation failure" error message when 
accessing a patient s record using the GUI BCMA.
 
Corrective Action: 
The "allocation failure" error message has been corrected.
 
5. Problem: NOIS MAD-1203-42204
The MAH Report takes an extended amount of time to run if the Start Date 
and the Stop Date of the report, requested by the user, are for different 
years. For example, if the Start Date is 12/28/03 and the Stop Date is 
01/03/04.
 
Corrective Action: 
The user can now request different years for the MAH Report without 
experiencing extended delays as BCMA accesses the data. 
 
6. Problem: NOIS MIN-1203-41637
Users sometimes experience an "Invalid Medication Lookup" error message 
after scanning a medication in the "Scan Medication Bar Code:" field of 
the "Order Manager"  dialog box when using the BCMA Med Order Button in 
GUI BCMA.
 
Corrective Action: 
The BCMA medication lookup process has been corrected to properly 
validate the medications scanned in the "Scan Medication Bar Code:" field 
of the "Order Manager" dialog box in GUI BCMA.
 
7. Problem: NOIS UNY-0104-10174
Multiple IV medication orders display as merged on the IV Medication Tab 
after an order is discontinued, but the IV bag is still infusing.
 
Corrective Action: 
Multiple IV medication orders will display properly on the IV Medication 
Tab.  
 
8. Problem: NOIS TNV-0104-30647
Users sometimes experience the following error message, "ERROR: 16^Server 
Protocol Disabled," when using the Edit Medication Log [PSB MED LOG EDIT] 
option. This occurs when the PSB BCMA RASO17 SRV Health Level Seven (HL7) 
server protocol is being disabled.
 
Corrective Action:
The error message is only intended to notify the BCMA software that the 
protocol is being disabled. BCMA will now validate the message and not 
display it to users. 
 
9. Problem: NOIS ISB-0104-31384
When an IV medication order with an infusing bag is "Renewed," the 
renewed order continues to display on the IV Medication Tab of the BCMA  
VDL  until the infusing bag is "Completed," even if the "Renewed" order's
Start Date/Time has expired.
 
Corrective Action:
When an IV medication order with an infusing bag is "Renewed," the 
renewed order will continue to display on the IV Medication Tab of the 
BCMA VDL until the infusing bag is "Completed," or until the Start 
Date/Time of the new order that was created during the renewal process. 
Once the new order is active, the infusing bag from the previous order 
will display on the BCMA VDL with the new order, along with any 
additional bags created from the new order. Any available bags from the 
previous order will display on the new order based on the IV Site 
Parameter settings in the GUI BCMA Site Parameters application.

<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2004-07-02 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>

 
*******************Important Note********************
 
Sites running the Bar Code Medication Administration  (BCMA) 
  Contingency Software must install this patch on all 
  Contingency workstations in addition to being installed
  on to the Vista Server. This patch is being released in 
  conjunction with the Inpatient Pharmacy patch PSJ*5*123. 
  Install both patches on to the Vista Server and the PSB*3*7 
  on to the Contingency Workstations as close together as 
  possible during non-peak times. Since the location of the 
  Pharmacy Orders "Admin Times" data has been changed 
  in the HL7 message you could see orders on the workstation 
  missing this data on orders updated due to transitions of data
  during the installation of these patches. The missing data will 
  correct  itself when that order is updated. 
  Once installed it is suggested that the sites review the 
  Contingency System reports. Any missing "Admin Times"
  can be corrected by running the Single Patient Init
  [PSB BCBU INIT SINGLE PT] option or the Workstation 
  can be re-initialized.
 
 *****************************************************
 
 1. A fix for the '&amp;' delimiter problem with the admin times. The 
      admin times was moved to another Field of the HL7 message 
      in the pharmacy patch PSJ*5.0*123.
      This patch compensates for the pharmacy change.
 
 2. When a user was added, edited or terminated, BCMA Contingency 
      Software would be called and the user would be evaluated, 
      and if appropriate be transmitted to the BCMA Contingency 
      Workstations.  This evaluation was not occurring correctly.  
      As a result, all users added, changed or terminated were being 
      transmitted to the workstations.  An additional screen was added
      to ensure that only the appropriate users accounts were 
      transmitted to the workstation.
 
 3. When a user had multiple divisions defined under their user 
      account and the workstations were setup using the 
      multidivisional capability the users divisions were not 
      interpreted correctly. A bug was found in the code that 
      looped through the user's division multiple and was corrected.
      
 
 4. The user Update portion of the BCMA Contingency was not checking 
      the status of the "PSB BKUP ONLINE" parameter. Additional code
      was added to check for the status of the "PSB BKUP ONLINE" 
      parameter. If the parameter is set to "NO" then no updates 
      will be transmitted to the workstation from the user portion
      of the package.

1.  Problem: NOIS MAD-0104-40858 
    The Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) reports,
    with the exception of the Cumulative/Vitals Measurement Report, does 
    not display allergy information in the reports header.
 
    Corrective Action: The BCMA Reports, with the exception of the 
    Cumulative/Vitals Measurement Report, displays allergy information in
    the reports header. The Reactions header has also been removed
    from the report and replaced with the "ADRs:" header.
 
2.  Problem: NOIS BUT-0204-20463
    The Medication Administration History [PSBO MH] option and the Due 
    List [PSBO DL] option add an exclamation point (i.e., Spec Inst:
    !Please verify) to the prefix of a Special Instruction.
 
    Corrective Action: The Medication Administration History [PSBO MH] 
    option and the Due List [PSBO DL] option correctly removes 
    the exclamation point (i.e., Spec Inst: Please verify) added
    to a Special Instruction.
 
3.  Problem: NOIS BED-0204-10327
    When a clinician administers a Pro Rea Nata (PRN) medication using 
    the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option, and the
    administration date/time is set to an earlier timeframe, the PRN
    administration date/time displays incorrectly on BCMA PRN
    Effectiveness Log Report as the entered date/time of this 
    administration occurred.
 
    Corrective Action: When a clinician administers a PRN medication 
    using the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option, and
    the administration date/time is set to an earlier timeframe, the PRN
    administration date/time displays correctly on the BCMA PRN
    Effectiveness Log Report as the actual date/time of the
    administration.
 
4.  Problem: NOIS NTH-0304-72663
    A "Null subscript" error occurs at routine line "EN+4^PSBVDLPA"
    when there is single patient with data entered in the BCMA Medication 
    Log File (#53.79) and indexes.  This error occurs during the 
    initial implementation of the BCMA Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
    system.
    
    Corrective Action: The initial implementation of the BCMA GUI will 
    not generate a "Null subscript" error at routine line "EN+4^PSBVDLPA".

*** ATTENTION: This patch includes a new Graphical User Interface 
       (GUI) executable file. Installation of this new GUI is 
        REQUIRED in order for the patch to function.  The new GUI
        MUST be installed IMMEDIATELY after the KIDS install in 
        order for the software to function. This Patch includes a 
        Post install that corrects problem number six below. The 
        installation time frame for this post install will vary based
        on the size of the site. This build will validate the correct 
        version of Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) GUI is in
        use. The correct GUI must be installed to support BCMA 
        Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Med Order 
        functionality ***

Installation Instructions section.
 
 1. Problem: NOIS HWH-0204-41213
    The Instructor information does not display in the legend of the 
    Medication Administration History [PSBO MH] option, and the audit log
    of the Medication Administration Log [PSBO ML] option.
 
    Corrective Action: The Instructor information displays in the legend  
    of the Medication Administration History [PSBO MH] option, and the
    audit log of the Medication Administration Log [PSBO ML] option.
 
2.  Corrective Action: When student and instructor information is 
    present at login the GUI BCMA CPRS Med Order button is disabled.
 
3.  Problem: NOIS HUN-0104-20931
    Infusing IV bags are duplicated on a "following" order after the
    order that was active when the IV bag was infusing has become
    "discontinued".  The Virtual Due List (VDL) attempts to display 
    duplicate bags and associates the same IV bags with multiple orders.
 
    Corrective Action:
    When an order with an infusing bag is discontinued, the VDL will
    either continue to display the infusing bag with the discontinued 
    order, or the VDL will display the infusing bag with an active 
    "following" order, but not both.
    
4.  Problem: NOIS ISB-0304-30352
    If an IV order with an infusing bag expires and the patient's record 
    is not accessed using Inpatient Medications (IPM) (e.g., the
    Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] option) the following message may
    appear, hindering an user's attempt to take action on the order:
    
           "Either the order status or the current scan status displayed 
           on the VDL does not match the status recorded in VistA! This 
           may be due to someone editing the order in VistA or another 
           individual scanning the medication. Your current action will 
           be canceled and the VDL will be refreshed to reflect the most 
           current order information."
 
    Corrective Action:
    A user will be able to take action on an expired IV order having an 
    infusing bag via the BCMA GUI VDL as appropriate.
     
5.  Problem: NOIS MOU-0304-32821
    The temporary, scratch global ^PSBORDA is automatically monitored and 
    documented via journaling procedures.  It is not necessary to journal 
    this temporary global since it is used solely as a temporary data 
    storage area.
 
    Corrective Action:
    The global ^PSBORDA will be renamed as an appropriate scratch "^TMP" 
    global with the first two subscripts being "PSB" followed by "$J".
 
6.  Problem: NOIS ISB-0404-31737
    With the release of BCMA Version 2 (PSB*2.0), any unit dose 
    order that is displayed on the "IVP/IVPB" tab and administered will 
    have a Ward Stock number generated and placed in the IV Unique 
    ID field (FIELD #.26) of the BCMA Medication Log (FILE #53.79)
    The Ward Stock number is stored in the BCMA Medication Log global and 
    is not displayed on the VDL or any BCMA Report.
   
    Corrective Action:
    A unit dose order that is displayed on the "IVP/IVPB" tab and 
    administered will not have a Ward Stock number generated and placed
    in the IV Unique ID field (FIELD #.26) of the BCMA Medication Log 
    (FILE #53.79). A post install will clean up all incorrect previous
    entries.

 1.  Problem: NOIS BUT-1203-21780
     Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) users are not able to re-
     instate a medication patch if it had been unintentionally marked as 
     'REMOVED' via BCMA. This issue has been delegated a 'PATIENT SAFETY' 
     keyword.
 
     Corrective Action:
     The removal of a medication patch may be undone if it had been
     unintentionally marked as 'REMOVED'; this may be accomplished by the
     user who marked the medication patch as 'REMOVED' or by a user
     allocated the "PSB MANAGER" key.
 
 
 2.  Problem: NOIS ISB-0204-30176
     The prompt "Enter the DATE of Administration: Today//" of the Manual 
     Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option has caused confusion.
     The user unintentionally accepts the default (i.e. "Today") when 
     attempting to document a past administration.     
 
     Corrective Action:
     The prompt "Enter the DATE of Administration: Today //" will be
     replaced by the prompt "Enter the DATE the medication was 
     administered: //" when using the Manual Medication Entry 
     [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option.  Also, this new prompt will not accept
     the entry of a future date/time for an administration.
 
 
 3.  Problem: NOIS PHO-0904-61033
     The BCMA Medication History report does not show large volume IV
     medications data when viewed via the Computerized Patient Record System
     (CPRS) GUI "Orders/View/Details..." option.
 
     Corrective Action:
     The BCMA Medication History report will display large volume IV 
     medications data when viewed via the CPRS GUI.
 
 
 4.  Problem: NOIS LAH-0404-61280
     The user is unable to access a patient's VDL when receiving an error
     message containing the text "GETPRNS+17^PSBPRN".  These messages occur
     when a patient is no longer admitted when that patient's VDL is
     refreshed.
 
     Corrective Action:
     BCMA will continue, without error, when a patient is no longer admitted
     while that patient's VDL is being viewed and refreshed.
 
 
 5.  Problem: NOIS MWV-0704-20690
     The user is able to change the status of an order's patch medication
     while that order concurrently has another 'GIVEN' and not 'REMOVED'
     patch medication.  After the initial status of a patch of that order has 
     been set to a status other than 'GIVEN', that patch can then be
     administered via BCMA, without a warning to the user concerning a
     concurrently 'GIVEN' patch.
 
     Corrective Action:      
     BCMA will not allow multiple patches of a patch medication order to be
     at the status of 'GIVEN' concurrently.
 
 
 6.  Problem: NOIS SFC-0704-60956
     The user is unable to edit a 'NOT GIVEN' administration using the VISTA
     "Edit Medication Log" [PSB MED LOG EDIT] option.
 
     Corrective Action:
     The user will be able to edit 'NOT GIVEN' administrations using the GUI
     version of the "Edit Med Log" found under the "File" menu of the BCMA
     VDL.
      
 
 7.  Problem: NOIS CLL-0704-40997
     If an IV piggyback bag is marked as 'GIVEN', the VDL is not refreshed,
     and the VDL "start/stop time" parameters are reset making that specific
     administration no longer display on the VDL, then that 'GIVEN' bag can
     be scanned and administered again.
 
     Corrective Action:
     BCMA will not allow an IV piggyback bag to be scanned and 'GIVEN' multiple
     times.
 
 
 8.  Enhancement:  Include Comments on the Medication History Report.
     PSB*3.0*3 will provide the user the ability to include comments that
     were documented during an administration to appear on the Medication
     History Report. This new functionality is accessible via the BCMA GUI
     and CPRS GUI.
 
 9.  Enhancement:  Report Medication History in reverse chronological order.
     PSB*3.0*3 will display the Medication History Report in reverse
     chronological order; chronologically latter order activities will display
     before earlier order activities.

1.  Enhancement:  Read Only Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA).
    This patch deploys the BCMA-HSC project "Read Only BCMA"
    functionality.  After the installation of this build (PSB*3.0*4)
    and installation of the released Read Only BCMA GUI executable
    file, users allocated the "PSB READ ONLY" security key will be
    granted documented Read Only BCMA functionality.  Also, as
    documented, users allocated the "PSB STUDENT" security key using
    BCMA while no BCMA instructor is using BCMA, will be granted Read
    Only BCMA functionality until a BCMA Instructor has accessed BCMA.
 
 
2.  Enhancement:  Patient Record Flag Reporting.
    This patch provides "Patient Record Flag" reporting functionality.
    During patient selection, information about any active Patient
    Record Flag(s) associated with the selected patient will be
    presented to the user.  This patch also give the user the ability
    to display and print details of all active Patient Record Flags.
    This patch will also display a "FLAG" button via the patient's GUI
    Virtual Due List.  This "FLAG" button gives the user access to a
    report of the all the active Patient Record Flags associated with
    the patient.

 1.  Problem: NOIS CTX-0804-70321
     Large volume IV orders do not show on the Due List Report.  The
     Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) Due List Report does
     not display information for large volume IV orders that have
     been created on the date selected for reporting.  
 
     Corrective Action:
     The BCMA Due List Report will display large volume IV data when
     appropriate.
 
 
 2.  Problem: NOIS MIW-0504-40557
     Scheduled administration times are reported and totaled on the
     Ward Administration Times Report per each clock hour.  If an
     order s stop time is between clock hours, that order s final
     scheduled administration is neither reported nor added to the
     report totals.
 
     Corrective Action:
     The BCMA Ward Administration Times Report will report and
     total all appropriate scheduled administration times.    
 
 
 3.  Problem: NOIS LIT-0704-71393
     The initial administration of an order which displays on the BCMA
     Graphical User Interface (GUI) Intravenous/Piggyback (IVPB) Tab 
     may result with an administration status of "GIVEN", "HELD", or
     "REFUSED".  When this same order is administered via the VISTA 
     Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option, the 
     initial administration status can only be "GIVEN".
 
     Corrective Action:
     The Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option will
     allow the initial administration of an IVPB order to result in
     an administration status of "GIVEN", "HELD", or "REFUSED".
 
 
 4.  Problem: NOIS UNY-0304-10606
     When the user prints a Medication Administration History (MAH)
     report with a date range exceeding seven (7) days, Pro Re Nata
     (PRN) order activity, which occurred that last day of the
     report s date range, does not display.
 
     Corrective Action:
     PRN activity occurring within the selected MAH report date range
     will display on that MAH report.
 
 
 5.  Problem:
     When creating a MAH report, the administration times of orders
     that have start time between the report's date range do not
     display properly.
 
     Corrective Action:
     The MAH report will display order administration times properly.
 
 
 6.  Problem: NOIS ISB-0105-30190
     When using the GUI Edit Med Log to add a comment for an 
     administration having units given less than 1.0, the message - "When 
     changing the admin status to Given, at least one dispensed drug must 
     have a units given ..."  - is displayed and the comment is not filed.
     This error is due to the value in the Units Given field of the GUI
     Edit Med Log being presented without the "leading zero" when the 
     value is less than 1.0.
 
     Corrective Action:
     When the Units Given value of an administration is less than zero, 
     it will be presented via the GUI Edit Med Log with the leading zero.
 
 
 7.  Problem: NOIS ISB-1104-31950
     The Medication History Report does not display a leading zero in
     its "Units GIVEN" data field when display a numerical fraction.
 
     Corrective Action:
     A leading zero will display in the Medication History Report,
     "Units GIVEN" data field when appropriate.
 
 
 8.  Problem: NOIS BUT-1204-21117
     There are instances when the "Units Of Administration" data field
     of the Medication History Report does not "break" and remain legible.
 
     Corrective Action:
     The "Units Of Administration" data field of the Medication History
     Report will "break" and maintain whole words and legibility.
 
 
 9.  Problem: NOIS UNY-0105-11034
     The heading for the Due List Report, "Future Orders" section is 
     displayed and is not followed by "Future Order" data when at least
     one future active order exists, and no future order has a scheduled 
     administration within the selected report time parameters.     
 
     Corrective Action:
     The heading for the Due List Report, "Future Orders" section will not
     display, unless "Future Order" data is to be displayed.

 1.  Problem: HD000000088329
     The Medication Order Button (MOB) within the Graphical User
     Interface, Bar Code Medication Administration system (BCMA)
     malfunctions after the Installation of patch PSB*3*9.  When the
     BCMA MOB is used to administer medications and create orders, 
     all data is stored and maintained properly.  The malfunction
     occurs when the post PSB*3*9, BCMA system frees memory after
     all administration and order processing has occurred and BCMA
     begins to free memory per MOB activity.  Because a variable
     needed by BCMA MOB exit activities has been cleared, BCMA generates
     the "&lt;UNDEFINED&gt;MOBR+25^PSBAPIPM" before processing has completed.
 
 
     Corrective Action:
     PSB*3*15 will allow BCMA MOB exiting processing to complete
     without error.

1.   Problem: Remedy #HD0000000092269
     Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) software errors at line 
     "EN+78^PSBVDLPB" when a BCMA Medication Log (file #53.79) record 
     being processed has its Action Status (field #.09) equal to "" .  
     The errant record is the result of an administration not properly 
     saved/discarded via Manual Medication Entry[PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY]         
 
     Corrective Action:
     BCMA will ignore all BCMA Medication Log (file #53.79)records with 
     Action Status field (field #.09) equal to ""; and when appropriate, 
     BCMA will send an electronic message (e-message) to members of the
     mail group that is specified via the BCMA Site Parameter - "Mail 
     Groups/Due List Error", when such a record is processed.  The 
     subject line of  this  e-message will read "BCMA - Admin XXXX 
     Problem". The subject line of this e-message will contain the 
     internal entry number (IEN), identifying the errant BCMA Medication 
     Log (file #53.79) record.  That IEN is represented above by the
     text "XXXX".  PSB*3.0*11 will allow access to the errant records via 
     Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option for deletion 
     or correction.  The errant records may be accessed using 
     Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option
     by users possessing the PSB Manager Key or the user who initiated 
     that administration. Details about the errant administration are 
     within the e-message sent.  The e-message will contain data 
     necessary to reprocess, via the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG 
     NEW ENTRY] option, that incomplete and errant administration.
     The following is an example e-message:
**************************************************************************
 
 Subj: BCMA - Admin 11111 Problem  [#22222222] 07/13/05@13:37  12 lines
 From: JACKSON,TODD ELLIS  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   The following administration was NOT displayed
   on the Virtual Due List
 
   Order Number....: 21V
   Orderable Item..: HEPARIN SOLN
   Patient.........: BCMAPATIENT,ONE (000-00-9678)
   Ward/Bed........: 7A GEN MED 724-A
   Reason..........: JUL 13, 2005@07:00 admin's ACTION STATUS is "UNKNOWN".

   BCMA Med Log IEN: 11111
   User............: ( # 00000000000 ) BCMAUSER,ONE
 
**************************************************************************
     Per the above example, to correct the example, errant entry #11111, 
     the specified "User" or a person holding the PSB Manager Key may use 
     the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option and 
     correct the "Reason" for the "BCMA - Admin Problem"; that person can 
     correct that "JUL 13, 2005@07:00 admin's ACTION STATUS" per the 
     specified patient and order, via corresponding responses to Manual 
     Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option prompts.  The 
     "correction" is to properly complete or delete that incomplete 
     administration.
 
     An e-message triggered by an incomplete administration of a Pro
     Re Nata (PRN) [As Needed] medication must be maintained via VISTA 
     File Manager (FileMan).  The IEN of the entry that needs corrected 
     is labeled "BCMA Med Log IEN:" within the e-message as well as 
     displayed in the e-message's subject line, immediately after the 
     text "BCMA - Admin".
 
     It is possible to correct any errant BCMA Medication Log (file 
     #53.79) entry using FileMan and the IEN supplied by this e-message.
 
 
2.   Problem: Remedy #HD0000000093022
     The Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option does not 
     maintain the "Given" status per medication patch administrations on 
     the BCMA Virtual Due List (VDL).  The user is unable to determine 
     which administered patch must be removed when the VDL does not 
     display the patch as "Given".  
 
     Corrective Action:
     A patch administered via the Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG 
     NEW ENTRY] option will show as "Given" on the BCMA VDL.
 
 
3.   Problem: Remedy #HD0000000103739
     The Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY] option 
     malfunctions when attempting to administer an "odd schedule" order 
     on days the order is not scheduled to be administered.
 
     Corrective Action:
     Display appropriate data when "odd schedule" order administrations 
     are attempted.

********************Important Note***************
 
  If the site is running the BCMA Contingency software then this
  patch must also be installed on the workstations. Once installed
  it is suggested that the sites review the Contingency system
  reports.
 
*************************************************
 
 
Enhancements and issues addressed in this patch are as follows:
 
 
1. It was reported by a site that Lodgers and Dom patients were
   creating alerts. Lodgers and Dom patient are now screened.
 
2. It was reported that when a patient was discharged the discharged 
   message was not always being sent to the workstations and an alert
   was being generated. The problem was caused by how movements were
   sent to the Contingency by Patient Movements. The Contingency will
   compensates for these issues now.
 
3. When printing the Medication Administration Report (MAR) for current
   orders it would also include any non-active orders for the current
   day being printed. The report now goes by date and time.
 
4. A new purge utility has been introduced for the workstation. It
   allows the site to define how much historical data to maintain on the
   workstation. Any unwanted data will be removed from the workstation.
 
5. The way the Med Log information is being displayed on the MAR has
   changed. In the previous version the information was displayed by date
   entered and the user had to select a starting date when running the
   MAR. Depending on the frequency of the MED Log this could cause the
   report to be long. The report now reverses the order of the Med Log
   information so the report displays the most recent first. The user can
   then opt for how many to display by numeric value such as 1, 2 or more.
 
6. A blank page was added between the patients on multi patient
   reports for easier sorting.
 
7. Provider comments were moved to be displayed along with the Drug
   and Give information.
 
8. The sorting of orders on the MAR reports have been grouped by the
   order type. Types include Pending, Unit Dose, IV and PRN.
 
9. A place holder for the Last Action of drugs has been added to the
   reports. A future patch will complete the functionality.
 
10. A problem with Pending orders remaining on the workstation when
    replacement orders are done by pharmacy has been resolved.
 
11. A problem was discovered with the user access updater. When a user's
    name changed it did not update the Contingency workstations
    correctly.
 
12. A &lt;UNDEFINED&gt;NURV+16^ALPBCBU error has been resolved.
 
13. A problem with updating the Contingency workstations during a patient
    movement activity has been addressed.
 
14. Added the function to sort MARS by Room/Bed or by Patient Name.
 
15. Patients that had no allergies reported to the contingency do not
    display any allergies data on a MAR. Now when no allergies are found
    on the contingency, the following will display on the MAR. "Allergies:
    No allergies reported to the Contingency"
 
16. Possibility of routine ALPBPWRD erroring out at line
    ..S ^TMP($J,"BCBU",+ALPRM,ALPRM,ALPBD,ALPBPTN)=ALPBIEN
    When sorting by room/bed Cache tries to convert certain room/beds like
    5E155 and produces a &lt;MAXNUM&gt; error. The problem occurs when the
    variable is manipulated. Cache will take the 5E155 and convert it to
    "5" appended with 155 zeros. A code change was made to prevent this
    issue.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses three Remedy tickets, HD68121, HD113034, and HD90393.
 
 
The first issue, HD68121, is the result of a file locking problem with 
the routine PSBMD.  This error only appeared after the site converted to 
Cache' version 5.  There is an undefined variable error created with 
Missing Dose reports in Pharmacy, even though a record is created in 
^PSB(53.68).  By attempting to lock the ^PSB(53.68) file before 
attempting to print the report, it will ensure that the file exists so 
the undefined error will not occur.  This locking fix was created by the 
Minneapolis IRM staff, and has been working in their production area for 
months.  The fix is being brought back to the VMP group so it can become 
part of a national patch release, and other sites can avoid this error in 
the future.
 
The second issue, HD113034, happens when a medication PATCH (such as 
Fentanyl) is marked as REMOVED after initially being given to the 
patient.  If you right-click the mouse on the order in BCMA and mark the 
patch as "REMOVED", when you subsequently check the med log, the units 
given remains 1.  However, if you use the BCMA menu option FILE/EDIT Med 
Log and mark it "REMOVED", the units given becomes 0, and the audit trail 
shows "Doses given '1' deleted".  The correct value for units given is 
actually 1 (as right-clicking the mouse shows), because the medication 
was indeed given, but the patch was subsequently removed, not deleted or 
refused.
 
The third issue in this patch, HD90393, addresses a printing problem with 
the PRN Effectiveness report when it is printed by Ward/Room-Bed.  When 
this printing filter is applied, the report prints in patient DFN order, 
not Ward/Room-Bed order.  This fix corrects a problem in the BCMA code so 
that when the Ward/Room-bed filter is applied, the report will print 
properly.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses Remedy Ticket HD127231, which arose after the 
install of patch PSB*3*20.  Patch PSB*3*20 added the patient header 
information to the MAH report if the report for a medication ran longer
than one page.  Additionally, PSB*3*20 was designed to reprint the first 
six lines of the orderable item information on subsequent pages to help 
the nurses keep track of what medication they were viewing
on the MAH report.  However, when the next medication on the report was 
due to be printed, and a page break occurred before the orderable item 
information was printed, the second page of the report printed
the first six lines of the orderable item in duplicate.
 
The fix included in this patch will still print the patient header 
information on subsequent MAH pages, but it will not reprint the first 
six lines of the orderable item information.
 
**NOTE** This fix only affects the report when printed to a printer.
This does not affect the GUI display or printing the report to the
terminal screen.

***************************Important Note*************************
  If the site is running the BCMA Contingency software then this
  patch must also be installed on the workstations. Once installed
  it is suggested that the sites review the Contingency system 
  reports. 
******************************************************************
 
Issues addressed in this patch are as follows: 
 
1. It was reported that after loading Patch PSB*3*8, the medication log 
   history was no longer printing. 
 
       Example:...
 
            BCMA MEDICATION LOG HISTORY
            Log Date        Message        Log Entry Person
            No entries since the above date are on file.
 
   This was caused by a missing cross reference (IMLOG) in file 53.7. 
   Cross reference has been added.
 
2. It was reported that the Print all option was not working correctly. 
   Routine ALPBPALL has been corrected.

***
 
This patch is a component of the Bar Code Medication Administration 
(BCMA) Version 3.0.  The main function of PSB*3.0*13 and the 
corresponding BCMA Graphical User Interface (GUI) software (BCMA Version 3
Patch 13 [3.0.13]) is to support BCMA v3.0 Clinical Context Object 
Workgroup (CCOW) compliance. The PSB*3.0*13 GUI and this Character User 
Interface (CHUI) software (PSB*3.0*13) also support Patient Safety 
Issues (PSI) and Remedy Ticket resolution and BCMA Coversheet refinement.
***
 
1.   Problem: PSI-05-064
     BCMA functionality enables a BCMA user to edit the free text 
     BCMA MEDICATION LOG FILE-DISPENSE DRUG SUBFILE (# 53.795) "Units
     of Administration" (field #.04) for an administered medication, when 
     using the Edit Medication Log.  Consequently, the GUI Edit 
     Medication Log (Edit Med Log) allows a BCMA user to modify text in 
     the field labeled "Units" of the "BCMA - Edit Med Log" dialog box.  
     The user is able to change the "Units" from "PATCH" to any other text
     value.  Changing a "PATCH" medication to some other "Units", causes 
     BCMA to not process the administration properly; and causes the BCMA 
     Virtual Due List (VDL) to not present the administration properly.
 
     Corrective Action:
     The BCMA GUI Edit Med Log will not allow any BCMA user to edit the 
     BCMA MEDICATION LOG FILE/DISPENSE DRUG SUBFILE (# 53.795) "Units 
     of Administration" (field # .04) of an administered "PATCH" 
     medication.
 
2.   Problem: PSI-05-032
     The VDL displays a GIVEN medication patch until it has been marked as
     "REMOVED".  This is causing some confusion to users.
 
     Corrective Action:
     BCMA will provide a site parameter that will specify the number of 
     days (7-14) a GIVEN patch will display on the VDL.  The count of 
     days the GIVEN patch displays on the VDL begins when the 
     medication order expires.  This parameter may be set to ""
     (null) to allow GIVEN patches to display on the VDL until it is 
     marked as REMOVED.
 
 
3.   Problem: PSI-05-115
     The Special Instructions on the VDL will display the entire Special 
     Instructions by wrapping the text as needed using the spaces in the 
     Special Instructions. However, ff a word or phrase (without spaces) 
     in the Special Instructions can not be wrapped due to the word or 
     phrase being longer then the width of the column, the text would be 
     truncated when the text ran into the right side of the column. In 
     addition, when the above happens, some of the ending words in the 
     special instructions may be omitted as well.
 
     Correction Action:
     When a word or phrase (without spaces) can not be wrapped and does 
     not fit in the column width, the text will be truncated with an 
     ellipsis to indicate that a portion of the word or phrase was 
     truncated. The occasional omission of ending words in the special 
     instructions will be corrected. 
 
 
4.   Problem:  HD0000000121694
     While a medication patch is being "administered" using Manual 
     Medication Entry[PSB MED LOG NEW ENTRY], that particular scheduled 
     administration does not display on the BCMA Virtual Due List (VDL).
 
     Corrective Action:
     Display the saved "action status" of an administration, while it is 
     being administered using Manual Medication Entry [PSB MED LOG NEW 
     ENTRY]
 
 
5.   Problem:  HD0000000127625
     An error occurs when the BCMA coversheet is to display data for one 
     order only; and that order is an expired, large volume IV.
 
     Corrective Action:
     The BCMA Coversheet will display without error when the only order 
     information to display on the BCMA coversheet pertains to an expired,
     large volume IV.
 
 
6.   Problem:  HD0000000132184
     An error occurs when the BCMA GUI Computerized Patient Record System 
     (CPRS)/BCMA Medication Order Button (MOB) is used and ORDER 
     File (#100) PATIENT LOCATION (field #6) data does not link to a 
     WARD LOCATION File (#42) entry.
 
     Corrective Action:
     BCMA will provide HOSPITAL LOCATION File (#44) data per ORDER File 
     (#100) PATIENT LOCATION (field #6) data when the CPRS/BCMA MOB is 
     used.  CPRS will ORDER File (#100) PATIENT LOCATION (field #6) data 
     to a HOSPITAL LOCATION File (#44) entry 
 
 
7.   Enhancement:  CCOW compliancy
     This patch (PSB*3.0*13) will enable BCMA CCOW compliancy.
 
 
8.   Enhancement:  Enhanced "*UNKNOWN* Action Status" support.
     BCMA Medication Log File (File #53.79) entries having unknown 
     Action Status (field #.09) data can be maintained via the GUI BCMA 
     Edit Med Log only. These entries may be maintained by persons holding
     the BCMA manager's key [PSB MANAGER] or that user unable to complete 
     the original administration.  PSB*3.0*13 supports the VISTA "Unknown 
     Action Status Report" option [PSBO XA].  The [PSBO XA] option 
     provides persons holding the BCMA manager's key [PSB MANAGER] 
     resource to generate a report to display BCMA Medication Log File 
     (#53.79) entries having "unknown" Action Status (field #.09) data.  
     Users holding the BCMA manager's key [PSB MANAGER] can access the 
     PSBO XA report via the BCMA GUI as well.  BCMA has been enhanced to 
     display a "pop-up box" when a user begins an action on an order 
 
 
9.   Enhancement:  Saved Coversheet Personal Parameters
     PSB*3.0*13 will maintain personal parameters per BCMA Coversheet 
     views to be saved and retrieved when using BCMA.

   idle time limit set via the "BCMA Idle Timeout" site parameter.
 
 
Enhancement - Indication When not all Drugs Have Been Scanned Per a
              Multiple Drug Order :
   BCMA GUI Version 3 Patch 10 will display a message box when
   the user has not scanned all the dispensed drugs per a medication 
   order that includes multiple dispensed drugs.  The message box will 
   display, requesting user confirmation.

This patch is a component of the Bar Code Medication Administration 
(BCMA) Health Systems Committee (HSC) Phase III project.  The main
function of PSB*3*32 and the corresponding BCMA Graphical User
Interface (GUI) software (BCMA Version 3 Patch 32 [3.0.32.*]) is to
provide the BCMA user with additional BCMA Coversheet and reporting 
support.
 
 
 
1.  Problem:  PSI-06-029/HD0000000126326
    Processing the BCMA Missed Medications Report causes the client to 
    "time-out" when the report is to display within the BCMA GUI 
    Application and prior to sending the report to a printer.
 
    Corrective Action:
    Make the Missed Medications Report process faster so the client 
    does not "time-out".
 
 
2.  Problem:  PSI-06-019/HD0000000130671
    There is difficulty determining the application of a medical patch 
    that has not been marked as REMOVED when that order has expired or 
    discontinued.
 
    Corrective Action:
    Allow the user to view and act on patches for expired or discontinued 
    orders when the patient's BCMA Virtual Due List (VDL) first opens.
 
 
3.  Problem:  PSI-06-056/HD0000000131075
    Issues related to extra Pro Re Nata (PRN) doses of medication 
    ordered as QDPRN or BIDPRN and reports of nurses missing the last 
    administration time, have cause patient safety concerns. 
 
    Corrective Action:
    The BCMA PRN administration dialog box will be enhanced to provide the
    following features for all PRN administrations:  Icon, Schedule, Last
    Given and Reminder checkbox and statement.
 
 
4.  Problem:  PSI-06-014/HD0000000128909
    Administration problems have been caused when Med Route abbreviations
    on the VDL have been confused.
 
    Corrective Action:
    Display the expanded version of the Med Route.
 
 
5.  Problem:  PSI-06-060/HD0000000143603
    Due to a limitation in the Delphi application, there is a 255-pixel
    limit on the row height in the BCMA GUI VDL that results in truncation
    of an order when there are a large number of additives/solutions on
    the order.
 
    Corrective Action:
    Adjust display area of medications on the VDL to compensate for orders
    with a large number of items to display.
 
 
6.  Enhancement:  New Coversheet Overview Reports.
    As a part of the BCMA HSC Phase III, patch PSB*3.0*32 and 
    PSB.3.0.32 GUI will provide BCMA users with reports that display 
    Coversheet Overview data.  There is a new Coversheet Report for each 
    Coversheet Overview.
 
 
7.  Enhancement:  Global Report Enhancements.
    Various enhancements have been made to BCMA reports in general.  These
    enhancements are presented in BCMA HSC Phase III documentation.
 
 
8.  Enhancement:  Coversheet and Other Miscellaneous Enhancements.
    A variety of new Coversheet and miscellaneous feature will be 
    supported with the installation of this patch.  The BCMA HSC Phase 
    III documentation provides details of these new features.

ATTENTION: This patch includes a new Graphical User Interface (GUI)
executable file. Installation of this GUI is required immediately
after the KIDS install for the Patch to function.
 
For retrieval and installation instructions, please see the Client
Installation Instructions section.
 
This patch is a component of the Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA)
Version 3.0 Managing Scanning Failures (MSF) project.  The main function
of PSB*3*28 and the corresponding BCMA GUI software (BCMA Version 3 Patch
28 [3.0.28]) is to document scanning failures during BCMA patient and
medication verification. Please see Release Notes document for more 
details on the following enhancements.
 
1. Enhancement:  Document Unable to Scan events. This patch will enable
   the user to document Unable to Scan events that occur during BCMA
   patient and medication verification.  The Computerized Patient Record
   System Medical Order Button and the creation of ward stock orders in
   BCMA will not be fully supported by the Unable to Scan functionality.
 
2. Enhancement:  Send a MailMan message for each Unable to Scan event.
   When a user documents an Unable to Scan event, a message will
   be sent to persons who are members of the mail group established
   via the BCMA Site Parameter's Unable to Scan mail group field
   setting. This message will also be sent to the user submitting
   the Unable to Scan event documentation.
 
3. Enhancement:  Add two new Unable to Scan Reports.
   Detailed and summary reports of BCMA Unable to Scan data may be
   executed by persons holding the PSB UNABLE TO SCAN security key.
 
4. Enhancement: Added Division Filtering to Unable to Scan Reports.
   The user's division is detected upon login, and used to filter
   Entire Facility and Nurse Unit options on the Summary Report, and All
   Patients/Wards option on the Detailed Report.
 
5. Enhancement: Added new PSB*3*32 functionality to the MSF reports.
   Patch PSB*3*32 created new report functionality requirements, such as
   allowing a start and stop time, and report preview. For consistency,
   these have been included in the MSF reports.
 
6. Enhancement: Usability.
   Made changes based on feedback from the MSF usability study.
 
7. Enhancement: Allow Action on Infusing or Stopped IV Bags.
   Added Take Action on Bag option to the IV Bag Chronology Window to
   allow user to take action on infusing or stopped bags without having
   to rescan the IV bag.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
ATTENTION: This patch includes a new Graphical User Interface (GUI)
executable file. Installation of this GUI is required immediately after
the KIDS install for the Patch to function.
 
 
This enhancement is intended to enable the BCMA application to recognize
whether it is operating in the Indian Health Service (IHS) or Veterans
Health Administration (VHA) environment, and respond by recognizing and
displaying the patient identifier appropriate to the environment.
 
This enhancement will also bring the BCMA application compliant to
Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Rehabilitation Act
Amendments of 1998, which mandates that all software developed by federal
agencies allow access to and use of information and data by individuals
with disabilities.
 
Please see the Release Notes for more details on the following
enhancements.
 
1. Enhancement: This will enable a single version of BCMA to be
   maintained by VHA and yet be installed and operate in a "plug and play"
   fashion in an IHS or Tribal facility running Resource and Patient
   Management System (RPMS).
 
2. Enhancement: The BCMA Graphical User Interface (GUI) will display
   vital measurements from the Veterans Administration (VA)
   VITALS/MEASUREMENTS package for VHA sites or optionally use the
   IHS PCC SUITE (APC) package which supports the V MEASURMENT file, if
   operating at an IHS facility and that facility is configured to use the
   V MEASUREMENT file.
 
3. Enhancement: Section 508 Compliance including Edit Med Log
   Administration Selection form and a list of forms which have labels
   which will be converted to VA508StaticText.
 
 
This Patch also Addresses 7 reported issues:
 
1. PSI-07-223 (PSPO-823) - If an IV order is already infusing when it is
   placed on provider hold, the IV can be stopped and then infused again
   while still on provider hold.
2. PSPO-1678 - The MULTIPLE DOSE pop up form blocks the dosage on the
   Virtual Due List (VDL).
3. All BCMA reports have a default date based on the Laptop Time instead
   of the Server Time.
4. The MedLog form in BCMA will accept a space for the required comment.
5. 3 Missing Dose request reasons are missing from the Reason drop down
   box on the BCMA Missing Dose form.
6. Remove the obsolete Scratch HFS Directory from the BCMA Parameters GUI.
7. The units ordered do not display on the BCMA Medication Log report
   when a missing dose is requested and the order is held and then given.

   administration of non-nurse verified medication orders, or to display a
   warning before administering non-nurse verified medication orders. 
   Facilities will be able to set this option by division. 
 
3. The Missed Medications report will now include a "Verified" column that
   will contain the initials of the nurse who verified the order, or three
   asterisks, indicating that the order was not nurse verified.

5. BCMA Client:
    a. Added window to display unlimited Special Instructions / Other
       Print Info via menu, right-click, and function key (F6).  This
       window is also used to display Special Instructions / Other Print
       Info when an order is flagged in Inpatient Medications and is given
       in BCMA.
    b. Fields which displayed Special Instructions / Other Print Info in
       forms were widened to 80 characters and have vertical scroll.
    c. Added Last Injections Site column to the Unit Dose VDL to show the 
       what the last site was per Orderable item.
    d. Enhanced the Injection Site dialog window to show two 
       history tables.
