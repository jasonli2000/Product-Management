<dt>VERSION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1.0</dt>
<dt>DATE DISTRIBUTED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2012-05-08 00:00:00</dt>

<dt>INSTALLED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION OF ENHANCEMENTS:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This build contains TCP/IP transport functionality that enables
synchronous communication from the following:
   1) from non-M based systems to M-based VistA servers
   2) from M VistA servers to non-M systems (typically Java/J2EE based
      systems)
 
The communications are in the form of requests. For requests received by
the M-based system, the VISTALINK package contains a Request Manager to
manage these requests. Requests are forwarded to the appropriate Request
Handler.
 
The VISTALINK package contains two native request handlers. One handles 
system-type requests, like client heartbeats and close socket requests. 
The other handler processes RPC requests.
 
Other packages can also supply handlers. For example, VISTALINK SECURITY
(XOBS) supplies a handler that is used to process VistA security-related
requests.
 
VISTALINK allows the following request formats:
   1) XML and conform to a XML Schema 
   2) a proprietary format (package must supply a proprietary parser)
   3) both 1 and 2
 
VISTALINK also supplies a Java/J2EE component that allows developers of
Java applications to make synchronous requests on the M server and for M
applications to make synchronous requests of Java/J2EE application
servers. The Java/J2EE side implements the J2EE Connector Architecture
v1.0 framework (J2CA).
 
** NOTE: As of 7/2005, VISTALINK only supports Java to M communication.
 
Finally, VISTALINK contains a number of library calls available to 
other packages for developing a request handler if needed. (Currently, 
only VISTALINK SECURITY is allowed to use these calls.)

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This build contains the M side software for the Foundations Toolbox.
 
 
This build requires that the M XML Parser 1.1 be installed in the account.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 This patch will set the RPC Broker variable XWBOS in VistALink routine
 XOBVSKT which is used in TCP/IP socket processes.
 
 Setting this variable is necessary to accomodate remote procedure calls 
 that test for this variable directly.
