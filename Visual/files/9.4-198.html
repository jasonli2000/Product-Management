PATCH OVERVIEW
 
The Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act National 
Council for Prescription Drug Programs (HIPAA NCPDP) initiative, whose 
ultimate goal is to provide functionality allowing electronic transmission
of Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) prescription claims to payers and the receipt 
of claim responses (including drug utilization review responses and 
warnings) on a real-time basis, is being developed and introduced in a 
phased implementation strategy. This deployment strategy was utilized due 
to the complexity of the functionality and the number of product line 
dependencies.
 
The first release of this two part implementation is BPS*1*0, comprised of
the new Electronic Claims Management Engine (ECME) package (in the BPS 
namespace), plus the patches PSS*1*81, IB*2.0*223, IB*2.0*251, and 
PRCA*4.5*202, which are listed here in order of installation. BPS*1*0 is a
dormant release that only allows each site to perform preliminary setup 
work and to confirm that the software does not adversely affect other 
packages.
 
There are two main areas addressed by BPS*1*0:
 
a. Registration of the Pharmacy with the Vitria BusinessWare IE.
b. The Insurance Matching of Group Plans with Pharmacy Plans
 
Following the installation of BPS*1*0, each site must register their 
pharmacy with Vitria and match applicable insurance group plans using the 
insurance matching screens. These processes are detailed in the HIPAA 
NCPDP CONNECTION FOR EDI PHARMACY INSTALLATION GUIDE and the E-PHARMACY 
CLAIMS INSURANCE PROCESS document. Both of these documents are located on
the anonymous directory. It is very important that the IRM or person
installing the patch at each facility provide a copy of these documents to
its ADPAC(s) and any other relevant staff who will be responsible for
registering their pharmacy with Vitria and completing the insurance 
matching process.
 
At a later date, additional HIPAA NCPDP patches will be released to 
activate all of the HIPAA NCPDP functionality. Until that time, sites will
not be able to electronically submit claims utilizing this new 
functionality.
 
The HIPAA NCPDP project was created in response to a Chief Business Office
(CBO) request for modifications to several Veterans Health Information 
Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) software applications in 
accordance with HIPAA Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions and 
NCPDP mandated format standards, specifically the NCPDP Telecommunication 
Standard v.5.1.
 
The specific functionality for this patch is listed below.
 
(1)  A user interface has been developed to facilitate entry and filing
     Registration and Point of Contact information for each specific
     Application (Site) and Pharmacies at a site.
 
(2)  An HL7 interface is included that will create and send HL7 messages
     containing the Application and Pharmacy Registration data to Vitria.
     This data notifies Vitria that the site will soon be sending 
     electronic third party pharmacy claims. 
 
(3)  An additional HL7 interface is included which receives messages from
     Vitria containing the most up to date Payer Sheet data, and files the
     data into the appropriate Vista table. This interface will run 
     continously, and will keep the site updated with the most recent
     changes and additions to the third party Payer sheets.
 
New Globals:
============
 
The following globals will be created when installing this build.
 
^BPS            -       MOSTLY STATIC

Installation Steps
 
 1. Use VA FileMan to add the new domain, EPHARMACY.VITRIA-EDI.AAC.DOMAIN.EXT,
    to the DOMAIN file (#4.2). The installation instructions are included
    in the patch description for the XM*DBA*160 patch. This domain must be
    in place before the installation of the IB*2*251 patch that is
    included in the BPS 1.0 Master Build.
 
 2. Download the KIDS file BPS_1_0.KID via FTP. This file needs to be 
    retrieved in ASCII format.
 
 3. Review mapped sets for the PSS*, IB*, and PRCA* namespaces.  If the 
    routines are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped set at
    this time.
 
 4. From the Kernel Installation &amp; Distribution System menu, select the 
    Installation menu.
 
 5. From this menu, select the Load a Distribution option. When prompted 
    for a file name, enter the directory name where you FTPd the build, 
    followed by BPS_1_0. In our example, the file name is
    USER$:[ANONYMOUS]BPS_1_0.KID. Determine the location where you stored
    your build to decide the correct file name entry.
 
 6. At the "Want to Continue with Load? YES//" prompt, enter YES.
 
 7. At the "Want to RUN the Environment Check Routine: YES//" prompt, 
    answer YES.
 
 8. From this menu, the installer may select to use the following options:
 
(When prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter BPS 1.0)
 
    a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
    message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup
    any other changes such as DDs or templates.
 
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will allow
    you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is installed.
    It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs, templates,
    etc.).
 
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will ensure the 
    integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
 
 9. At the "Select Installation Option:" prompt, enter 6 Install 
    Package(s)
 
10. At the "Select INSTALL NAME:" prompt, enter BPS 1.0.
 
11. When prompted, "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
    Install? YES//" respond NO.
 
12. When prompted, "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
    respond NO.
 
13. When prompted, "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
 
14. When prompted, "Device:Home//" respond with the correct device and DO 
    NOT queue this to P-Message.
 
15. If routines were unmapped as part of step 3, they should be returned 
    to the mapped set once the installation has run to completion.

PATCH OVERVIEW
 
The Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act National
Council for Prescription Drug Programs (HIPAA NCPDP) initiative, whose
ultimate goal is to provide functionality allowing electronic transmission
of Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) prescription claims to payers and the receipt
of claim responses (including drug utilization review responses and
warnings) on a real-time basis, is being developed and introduced in a
phased implementation strategy. This deployment strategy was utilized due
to the complexity of the functionality and the number of product line
dependencies.
 
This is the second part of the Electronic Claims Management Engine (ECME)
package (in the BPS namespace), also known as the active build. It
comprises of these patches: BPS*1*1, PSO*7*148, PSS*1*90, PSX*2*48 and
IB*2*276.
 
This build will introduce functionality supporting Point of Service
Outpatient Pharmacy claim and billing processing by collecting billing and
clinical information within the prescription fill workflow process.  This
build will create real-time electronic claims and send claim data to
adjudicating payers from the new VistA Electronic Claims Management Engine
(ECME) via the VistA HL7 module (using the PSO NCPDP link) to the Vitria
server at the FSC in Austin, TX in a HIPAA compliant (NCPDP V. 5.1)
format. Vitria will then store and forward these transactions to WebMD for
final submission to the payer on a real-time basis. Payer responses will
be received and returned to VistA in the appropriate manner (i.e. - claim
transactions sent to Integrated Billing (IB), Drug Utilization responses
and warnings sent to the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 package and rejections
made available to the appropriate personnel for review and analysis).
 
Within VistA, throughout this process, constant bi-directional
communication via API's between Outpatient Pharmacy, Integrated Billing,
and ECME will process and generate these claim and billing transactions at
the appropriate trigger points within the standard VA process workflow.
