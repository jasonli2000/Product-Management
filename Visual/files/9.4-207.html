VBEC*1*0 is being exported as part of the VBECS_BUNDLE_1.KID package 
release. The installation of this bundle will be controlled by phase 
release.  An Implementation Manager will be assigned to your site and 
will contact your POC for VBECS and will provide your site with the 
location of the KIDS Host Files prior to your scheduled installation date 
Installation Sequence.  The VBECS BUNDLE is a host file that consists of 
both VBEC*1*0 and LR*5.2*325.  Installation of the VBECS BUNDLE will 
automatically install both VBEC*1*0 and LR*5.2*325
=====================
 
I. OVERVIEW
The VistA Blood Establishment Computer Software (VBECS) shall facilitate 
ongoing compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards for 
medical devices and enhance the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) ability to deliver quality 
services to meet the needs of the user community. VBECS is considered an 
encapsulated medical device and therefore does not communicate directly 
with other VistA applications.
 
Two new namespaces are being introduced into the VistA enterprise with 
the release of VBECS. The first, gov.va.med.vbecs, represents the Blood 
Bank medical device software. The second, VBEC, represents the VBECS 
Application Interfacing Support software. The VBEC namespace, created in 
the VBEC 1.0 KIDS build, will be added to the Package file in VistA and 
is used to identify the M software and files that support interfacing 
other VistA applications with the Blood Bank medical device. This 
software is not released as part of the Blood Bank medical device.
 
II. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
The reengineered Blood Bank system uses VistALink and Health Level Seven 
(HL7) messaging for data exchange with a client-server mode application 
interfacing architecture through M Application Programmer Interfaces 
(APIs), VistA Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), and HL7 interfaces released 
in the VBEC 1.0 KIDS build.
 
This software will provide a transparent database transition through the 
use of M APIs, RPCs, and HL7 interfaces. The APIs released in this build 
will allow other VistA applications to continue the retrieval of Blood 
Bank data stored in the Blood Bank system. The RPCs will allow the Blood 
Bank system to continue to retrieve data from other VistA applications. 
The HL7 interfaces will allow the exchange of data between the Blood Bank 
system and other VistA applications.
 
III. TECHNICAL COMPONENTS
This section lists the components of the VBECS, and LAB SERVICES 
installed in VistA by the VBEC BUNDLE 1.0 Multi Package KIDS build that 
supports VBECS.
 
 
MAIL GROUP:
===========

arise with VBECS Application Interfacing. The users added to this  group 
would be Lab/Blood Bank supervisors and/or IRM responsible for  managing 
the VBECS package and interfaces.

OPTION:
=======
 VBECS VISTALINK CONTEXT - (B)roker type option used by VistALink to
 authenticate users. All Blood Bank users must have this option
 assigned as a Secondary Menu Option.
 
 
PROTOCOL:
=========
 VBECS ADT-AO8 CLIENT - This protocol is used to deliver HL7 messages
 from VistA to VBECS via the VBECSPTU logical link.
 
 VBECS ADT-A08 ROUTER - This protocol is used to receive an HL7 message
 from the VAFC ADT-A08 SERVER protocol and executes routing logic to
 determine whether the message is to be forwarded to VBECS. VBECS
 receives only messages that contain changes to various patient
 demographic data.
 
 VBECS ADT-AO8 SERVER - This event driver protocol is triggered by the
 
 VBECS ADT-A40 CLIENT - This protocol is used to deliver the HL7
 message from VistA to VBECS via the VBECSPTM logical link.
 
 VBECS ADT-A40 SERVER - This event driver protocol is triggered by the
 
 
 VBECS OMG CLIENT - This is the subscriber protocol to the VBECS OMG
 SERVER protocol that receives the HL7 message from VBECS providing
 order updates to the original order message.
 
 VBECS OMG SERVER - This protocol is triggered when an HL7 message from
 VBECS is received by the HL7 package.
 
HL7 APPLICATION PARAMETER:
==========================
 VBECS - This HL7 Application represents the VBECS side of the VBECS/CPRS 
interface.
 
 VBECS ADT - This HL7 Application represents the receiving application
 of the Patient Update and Patient Merge router protocols.
 
 VBECS TRIGGER - This HL7 Application represents the VBECS side of the
 Patient Update and Patient Merge interfaces.
 
HL LOGICAL LINK:
================
 VBECS-OERR - Used to transmit HL7 messages from VBECS to CPRS.
 
 VBECSPTM - Used to transmit HL7 messages from VistA to VBECS when a
 patient merge event occurs.
 
 VBECSPTU - Used to transmit HL7 messages from VistA to VBECS when a
 patient update event occurs.
 
PARAMETER DEFINITION:
=====================
 VBECS VISTALINK - Parameter definition used to identify all VBECS 
Parameters.
 
PARAMETERS:
===========
 LISTENER IP ADDRESS - Stores the value of the Blood Bank medical
 device server where the VistALink listener is installed.
 
 LISTENER PORT NUMBER - Stores the value of the port number where Blood
 Bank medical device VistALink listener is listening.
 
 These Parameters are used by M APIs to build the XML messages used by 
VistALink.

location of the KIDS Host Files prior to your scheduled installation 
date. The documentation files will be available for download in advance 
of installation through the anonymous download site.
 
   1. Use the 'LOAD A DISTRIBUTION' option (#1) on the 'KIDS INSTALLATION'
      menu, and enter: VBECS_BUNDLE_1.KID 
 
   2. From the 'Kernel Installation &amp; Distribution System' menu, select
      the Installation menu.
 
   3. From this menu, you may now elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter  VBECS BUNDLE 1.0)
 
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
         backup any changes such as DDs or templates.
 
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
 
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
 
      d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
