<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 This Kernel patch is dependent on MailMan patch XM*7.1*24.  Both
patches must be installed at the same time. This patch contains the
following features:

-KIDS will disable Protocols during the install process.  This
 functionality was removed in patch XU*8.0*10.
-KIDS will not disable Options or Protocols which have an Action of
 'USE AS LINK FOR MENU ITEMS'.
-Two new functions, $$PRODE^XPDUTL and $$OPTDE^XPDUTL, can be called
 during the install process.
-KIDS now creates Packman messages in a format that MailMan can
 understand.
-Two options, 'Recover deleted option set' [XQOOREDO] and 'Toggle
 options/protocols on and off' [XQOOTOG] are now under 'Out-Of-Order
 Set Management' menu.
-Corrects undefined error when 'Compare Transport Global to Current System'
 option is queued. NOIS OKL-0296-70233 and LAS-0396-60110
-When a link to Package file doesn't exist during the load process, the
 Install file wasn't being updated with a new link during the install
 process. This is now corrected.
-The install process will display a message for each CPU it updates.  It
 use to only display a message for the first one.
===========================================================================
This patch can be installed with users on the system, no user should be
using KIDS during the install of this patch.  MSM sites must manually move
the routine XPDIJ to their other CPUs. KIDS cannot automatically move this
routine for you.
  
===========================================================================
  
INSTALLATION:
  1.  These routines are usually mapped on systems that allow mapping,
      so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routines.
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
  4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the option 
      'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' and verify that all routines
      have the correct checksums.
  5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the option 
      'Backup a Transport Global' to make a backup copy of the old
      routines being brought in by this patch.
  6.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the option 
      'Install Package(s)'. Select the package 'XU*8.0*21' and proceed
      with install.
  7.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
      other CPUs?'.
  8.  MSM Sites - D ^%RCOPY to move the routine XPDIJ to your other
      CPUs.
  9.  AXP Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 This Kernel patch  contains the following features:

-KIDS will now correctly turn off Alpha/Beta testing for a package.
-The routine XQABTMP can be used to turn off Alpha/Beta testing for
 previously released packages that used KIDS.   i.e. Kernel 8.0,
 Radiology 4.5, Toolkit 7.3
-Build File Print now pages correctly when displaying the description.
-New function $$PATCH^XPDUTL(patch) checks if patch has been installed.
-The TYPE field in the OPTION file now contains B:Broker (Client/Server).
-A new field, PRE-TRANSPORTATION ROUTINE (#900), is in the BUILD file.
-Updates to routines and data dictionary to support the new security features
 of the RPC Broker.  This patch is a prerequisite to installing the released
 version 1.0 of the RPC Broker.  RPC Broker version 1.0 is scheduled to be
 released at the end of May, 1996, and will need to be installed to support
 the PCMM with a graphical interface.

 Please note: The sign-on project that was distributed with the RPC Broker
              Developer Preview Kit (version 1T11) will not function after
              this patch is installed.  The Preview Kit served the function
              of illustrating possible DHCP directions.  It was not intended
              for use in production environments.  We are providing this
              warning to you as an advisory.

===========================================================================
This patch should be installed during off-peak hours. Users can be on the
system, but no user should be using KIDS during the install of this patch.

 DATA DICTIONARY:  Partial DDs

  File: BUILD #9.6, Field: PRE-TRANSPORTATION ROUTINE #900.
    This field contains a [TAG^]ROUTINE that will be run during the
    transportation process for the Build.  This will allow a developer
    to populate the transport global using the variable XPDGREF.

  File: OPTION #19, Field: TYPE #4.
    This set of codes field has been updated to include the code
    B = Broker (Client/Server).    
 ===========================================================================

 FORMS:
  XPD EDIT BUILD      (File 9.6)
  Was change to add the field, PRE-TRANSPORTATION ROUTINE, to page 1.
 ============================================================================

 DOCUMENTATION:
  Developers can now put information in the KIDS Transport Global, which
 can be used by the Pre- or Post-install routines. KIDS will run the
 [TAG^]ROUTINE in the field  PRE-TRANSPORTATION ROUTINE during the transport
 process. This routine can use the variable XPDGREF to set nodes in the
 transport global.
 i.e.  S @XPDGREF@("My Namespace",1)="Information I need during install"

  During the install process, in the Pre- or Post-install routines, the
 developer can retrieve the data by using the same variable, XPDGREF. Since
 these nodes are part of the transport global, they will be removed when the
 install is completed.

  KIDS didn't turn off Alpha/Beta testing when the final version of a package
 was released. Because of this bug, Kernel 8.0 and Radiology 4.5 still have
 Alpha/Beta testing turned on.  You can run the routine XQABTMP to turn off
 testing for those packages.

  A new function is available to developers, $$PATCH^XPDUTL(patch) will return
 1 if patch was loaded on current system and 0 if it wasn't loaded. This
 function can be used in your Environment Check routine.
 i.e.  I '$$PATCH^XPDUTL("XU*8.0*28") W !,"You must install patch XU*8.0*28"

deleted there entry in the %ZTSK global.
 
NOIS CLE-1195-40343  In the "Grant Access by Profile" option. Secondary
Menu items that were in common with current secondary menu items would
get duplicated.  This has been fixed be adding a "B" X-ref to the
Secondary Menu subfile.  A post init will re-index this new X-ref on
current entries.  The adding of this B X-ref made it necessary to make
changes to other XQ routines that loop through the secondary menu list.
  
NOIS BUT-1295-20458  BOS-0496-10026
In the "Grant Access by Profile" option. The 
deletion of Keys, Files and Secondary options didn't work. If this
option was run twice in a row it would not use the new template user.
This would only happen if the job wasn't queued. This has been fixed.
 
NOIS --- The entry point EN^XQH leaves the variable XQH behind. This can
cause problems if the user goes back into XQH.  The change kills XQH at
the exit from the EN^XQH call.
 
MSG# 19316051  It has been pointed out that files 4 and 49 are missing
the data type flag from the second piece of the .01 field.  The .01 field
for both files is included.
 
It was pointed out that the QUEUED TO RUN ON VOLUME SET field in the

 2. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
    option will load the KIDS package in this message onto your system.
 3. Answer NO to the question:
    'Shall I preserve what is on disk in a separate back-up message ?'
 4. From the 'Installation Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the option
    'Verify Checksums in Transport Global' and verify that all routines
    have the correct checksum.
 5. Users can be on the system.
 6. From the 'Installation Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the option
    'Install Package(s)' Select the package 'XU*8.0*20' and proceed with
    install.
    Their is a POST-INIT that will run to build a B X-ref for the
    Secondary menu in the New Person file.
 7. If you are a MSM site move the routines to the other servers.  
    On a mapped system, rebuild your map set.

<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1996-06-06 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch fixes several NOIS and FORUM mail message problems.

NOIS HOT-0196-40372 When displaying the $JOB number in XUS91, if the number was
greater than 127 it was converted to a HEX value needed by DSM sites.  This 
caused problems with the newer versions of MSM that can have $JOB values greater
than 127.  This has been changed to check for values greater than 32768.

NOIS DAY-1295-41565 In %ZIS3 the use of %ZISQUIT in a hunt group would cause
the complete hunt group to fail, not the one entry.  This has been fixed
by killing %ZISQUIT after each try.

NOIS SAT-0196-71702  The number of characters on the task number that were
included in the VMS name was to small for the current task numbers at some
sites.  This has been fixed in %ZTMS3 to allow more characters in the name.

NOIS BRX-0196-10212  The executable help for the related frame subfield
of the Help frame file has bad code in it that prevents its use.  The
code has been commented out. (sent as a partial DD for file 9.2)

'IO/%ZTIO MM' TaskMan errors, This was used to confirm and understand an
 issue. The problem is understood and there isn't an need for the entry in
 the error log.  It has been removed from ZTMS2.

Forum # 17283911  On this message it was agreed that IO should be restored
if POP was returned with a non-zero value.  It currently is returned as 'NULL'
in this case.  This has been fixed.
 
Forum # 18837345  The help display of printers was impacted by a screen
%ZIS("S") that changed the naked.  This did not follow SAC guidelines, 
and has been fixed in ZIS5.

The OPEN/USE/CLOSE ^%ZISUTL calls didn't work.  This has been fixed in
ZISUTL and ZIS1.  The setting of IO(0) was changed to only happen one time
so that IO(0) should always point to the HOME device, fixed in ZIS.

Hans found that the taskman resource logging was not being done. The fix
was found in XUTMG43.  To make the sorting of taskman work consistent
the resource log string was changed in %ZTMS and %ZTMS3

I was found that the order of event during error traping needed improvment.
also requested was a hang to allow IO ports to reset during errors. This
has been done in %ZTMS.

NOIS IVM-1295-30057    If printing a spool document to a slave device the
the question about the number of copies would go to the slave device.
To fix the number of copies prompt was moved before the device prompt.
 
NOIS  ANN-0296-40311  The ZISPL* routines were still looking at the old
Kernel site parameter file.  Fixed by having them and %ZIS4 look at the
new Kernel system parameter file.

NOIS ALT-1195-20982  When taskman would internally set new run times for
tasks it was still using the old $H format.  (Cross CPU and waiting HFS)

When investigating another problem I notice that the load balance algorithm
would allow more that one system to start new work.  This was fixed by having
the node that was going to start new work to tell the other nodes to wait.

NOIS DAY-0596-40526  A syntax error at RES+1^%ZOSV1VXD

NOIS SDC-0596-60064  Problem was that users couldn't use ScreenMan after
doing 'Print a spool document' because the IO parameters didn't get reset.

-- The '%Index of Routines' option doesn't call the new version.

NOIS DAY-0496-41713  Submanager count always low. Site and John Beaufait
did a great job of researching this problem.

NOIS WBP-0596-21109, SDC-0496-60862  After patch XU*8*18 if the site has
error screens setup in taskman, a task getting an error would not get
its status updated.  This was especially true when the error happened
setting up Network Mail tasks, Follow-up Mail would check on the status
of the task and not start new ones believing that one was starting.
Thanks to David Dahlstrand for noticing the link.

NOIS PUG-0596-51586  The new OPEN^%ZISH call wouldn't work to write a 
newversion of a file.  Problem was only with the VAX DSM version.

FILEMAN TEAM Problems with $$FTG^%ZISH on VAX DSM and reading records
greater than 255 char.  ZISHMSM had the same problem.

NOIS DES-0795-41067  TaskMan on MSM system could see the SYSTEM SHUTDOWN
flag and would set the X-ref of the Inhibit Logon's field to prevent users
from login on.  If the shutdown was aborted the X-ref would keep user from
login on but looking at the Volume Set file would show the Logon Inhibit
field still set to NO, this was confusing to sites.  This has been fixed
by adding a new item to the set of codes System Shutdown that is set and
cleared by taskman.

NOIS IHS-0696-N0286  Site found a call to a missing TAG in %ZISH, it was 
part of some code that is undocumented and the call has been removed.

NOIS DAY-0196-42100  Intermittent UNDEF in XQALDEV.  One entry point didn't
have all the variables setup.

NOIS HUN-0396-20414  At VAX DSM sites running taskman from DCL the log 
files could excced the VMS limit and bring Taskman to a stop.  The fix
is to not record a log file.

FORUM errors.  UNDEF Error at SETVAR^%ZIS1 when slecting a item from the
Local Synonym list.

BRX-0296-10688 Site needed to help identify devices to users.  Site wanted

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 This patch changes the way KIDS secures a Packman Message. The prompt:
    'Enter the scramble hint:' 
 has been removed.  A new prompt:
    'Do you wish to secure this message? No//'
 will be asked after you enter the text for a message. This correct the
 problem that was identified by Nois CLE-0696-40353.
 This patch is the same as MailMan patch XM*7.1*33. Both patches contain
 the same MailMan and Kernel routines.
===========================================================================

PERSON CLASS file patch.
User documentation for this patch in PDF (Portable Document Format) is
available on the Infrastructure Home Page at
http://www.vista.domain.ext/softserv/infrastr.uct/ under New
Person file.  The PDF documentation may also be retrieved from the
anonymous directories at Hines, Albany, and Salt Lake City with the 
filename of 'XU_8_27.pdf'. 

This patch adds a new file PERSON CLASS (8932.1) with data.  
  
NOTE: The file PERSON CLASS is in global ^USC.  This will be a NEW global
for most sites. Please be sure to place this global and add it to your
translation tables.  This is a static file.

The patch also:
Adds a PERSON CLASS field to the NEW PERSON file.  This multiple includes
the following fields:  NUMBER (.001),  PERSON CLASS (.01), EFFECTIVE DATE
(2), EXPIRATION DATE (3).
 
Adds the PERSON CLASS field to the following options: Edit an Existing
User, Add a New User to the System, and Reactivate a User.
 
Adds three  new menu options:
 
PERSON CLASS EDIT ,(XU-PERSON CLASS EDIT), to the User Management menu.
This option only allows entry of PERSON CLASS data.
 
User PC Build Print, (XUSER PC BUILD) to print the entries of the
individuals in the NEW PERSON file who hold the Provider key AND have a
Verify Code.  It prints these fields:  NAME, PROVIDER CLASS (free text),
and PROVIDER TYPE (set of codes).  The last two fields may contain data
only at sites that have implemented Decision Support System (DSS).  This
option is not attached to a menu but may be added to the secondary menu of
any user who will be working on this project.
 
User PC Build Edit, (XUSER PC BUILD EDIT), a straight DIE option to allow
fast entry of PERSON CLASS data.  This option is not attached to a menu
but may be added to the secondary menu of a user who will be performing
data entry.

*** Patch for MSM sites ***
 
This patch changes ZU (for MSM) to look in the TASKMAN SITE PARAMETERS
file for the TASK PARTITION SIZE field. If this field has data then a
call is made to the MSM utility %PARTSIZ to change the jobs partition
size limit.  TASKMAN will also use this value in its job command when
starting a new submanager.  This will allow sites to reduce the default
partition size in SYSGEN, increasing the number of disk buffers.
This will allow sites to adjust partition site for running PCE.  Look
to the Cookbook to come out with recommendations on settings.  If unsure
what value to use leave the TASK PARTITION SIZE field blank and your
current sysgen value will be used.

             this package is installed. This field points to the VOLUME SET
             file, #14.5. A VOLUME SET must have the field SIGNON/PRODUCTION
             VOLUME SET, #9, set to YES.

  File:  VOLUME SET #14.5
   Field:  SIGNON/PRODUCTION VOLUME SET #9
             Enter Yes if this Volume Set has the following properties:
             1. Users can sign-on into the Kernel Menu system or the RPC
             Broker Server routine is running there.
             2. Has a productions UCI which contains application routines.
             3. The ^XTMP global is translated.
             If you enter Yes the Kernel Installation and Distribution
             System will be able to move routines to this Volume Set.  The
             Kernel Menu system will be able to run the Menu Microsurgery
             and keep menus updated.

E-Sig Improvements

New E-SIG functions so that other developers can follow the General
Counsels guidelines on E-SIG. This comes from a meeting at Birmingham on
9/18-20/95.  New routine XUSESIG1.

Changes to the New Person file:
 Added a DEGREE field to hold MD, RN, LPN...
 Added a DATE E-SIG LAST CHANGED field.  The seeding of the this field
 will be done by taking the current date+random(60)+30 days to give a date
 when the user will need to select a new E-SIG code.
The option XUSESIG BLOCK is included in this patch.
  
KERNEL functions to help developers.
 
$$CHKSUM^XUSESIG1($name_value,flag)
This would take a root ($name_value) and build a checksum for all data in the
root. (Not used now, flag would be used when there is more that one checksum
algorithm.)
 
$$ESBLOCK^XUSESIG1(ien)
This extrinsic function would return the set of fields from the new 
person file that are need as part of the hash for a acceptable E-Sig. 
If IEN is not passed in then DUZ is used.
(E-Sig block, E-Sig title, Degree, Current Date/Time)
 
$$EN^XUSESIG1(checksum,esblock)
If the ESBLOCK is not passed then the function would get the ESBLOCK. In 
either case this extrinsic function would encode the ESBLOCK using the 
checksum as the KEY.  Return a encoded string.  

$$CMP^XUSESIG1(checksum,$name_value)
The extrinsic function would compare the checksum passed in to the 
calculated value from the $NAME_VALUE.  Return 1 for match, 0 for no 
match.
 
$$DE^XUSESIG1(checksum,encoded_string)
This extrinsic function would decode the string using the checksum as 
the key.  Return a decoded string.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch contains 7 routines, 1 option, and 1 input template.  It
replaces XU*8*4 which has been canceled.  It fixes 3 problems in the Menu
System:
  
1.  Routines XQ72, XQ75, XQ83R, XQCHK, and XQT: If a parent option on the
top of a menu tree was placed out-of-order or locked a user might be able
to jump through it because of the way the compiled menus in ^XUTL were
being built.  [NOIS WBP-0895-22132]
  
2.  Routines XQSMD1 and XQOO: Confusion resulted when a user encountered
an option that contained a hyphen in the option name.  The software could
not easily distinguish between this type of option and two different
options presented with a hyphen between them as a range of options to
select.  The software now looks first to see if a single option meets the
selection criterion, and if so it ignores the possibility of a range of
options.
 
3.  The option XUEDITOPT and the input template [XUEDITOPT]:  A piece of
code was added to the template in Kernel 8 to start micro surgery to
rebuild the compiled menus after an option was created or changed.  This
resulted in errors because the code called FileMan from within a template.
The call was therefore moved to the Exit Action of the option to avoid
that conflict.  [NOIS ERI-1095-21763, FTM-1095-43520]
 
=========================================================================
INSTALLATION: 
  1.  Many of these routines may be mapped on systems that allow
      mapping, so you may need to disable mapping.
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This 
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
  3.  Answer NO to the question: 
      'Shall I preserve what is on disk in a separate back-up message ?' 
  4.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your 
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  
  5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the option 
      'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' and verify that all routines 
      have the correct checksums.  
  6.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the option 
      'Install Package(s)'. Select the package 'XU*8.0*29' and proceed 
      with the install.  
  7.  Rebuild your mapped set if necessary.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
     This patch contains a routine, and input template, and a change to
the data dictionary of the Option File [^DIC(19)].  It corrects 3 problems
with servers:
  
1.  [CML-0296-N1840 and LIT-0496-71332 ]  Server tasks were retained for
30 days in ^ZTSK, and several sites complained that this was too long and
therefore a waste of disk space.  The default task retention time was
lowered to 14 days, and a field was added to the Option File (ZTSK
RETENTION DAYS) to allow the site to set the retention time for each
server on the system from 1 to 365 days.
   
2.  [MCM-1096-51188]  A site complained that the edit template XUEDITOPT
did not allow them to edit the field SERVER DEVICE when working with a
server-type option.  This was corrected when the new field was added to
the template.
  
3.  [SLC-1096-50407]  Under certain circumstances, servers that were
designated as "Run Immediately" in the SERVER ACTION field were not
running at all but being queued because of a logic error.  This problem
was also noted by IHS.

 ** You need to install Kernel Patch XU*8*50 before installing this patch **
=============================================================================
 -This patch now allows you to transport a Global Package correctly. This bug
  was introduced with patch 44.
 -The input transform for the Name field in the Build file has been changed
  to allow sites to create local patches. It now allows 6 digit patch numbers
   i.e.  XU*8.0*662001
 -Kernel 8 patches will now contain the sequence number in the Patch
  Application History multiple of the Package file.
 -HL LOGICAL LINK entries were not being cross-referenced.
 -The post-install routine XQP50 will update the Patch Application History
  multiple with the information about patch 50. The DATE APPLIED and APPLIED
  BY fields will be the same as this patch.

MSG from Warren Wright about large numbers of DEVICE LOCK bulletins
sent when someone leans on keyboard.
 
NOIS MCM-1195-51490 That the DEVICE LOCK bulletins aren't much help.
 
NOIS CLE-1095-43605  The check if a user needed to be deactivated was
counting 'Keep at Terminate' keys even though they would never be removed. 
 
NOIS MAC-0696-61616 WBP-1195-20971 CTX-0896-71639 
The check to close hung SPOOL documents had a incorrect test.
 
NOIS SEP-0796-62056  The purge option was failing to get any site data
from the Kernel System Parameter file. It was looking at the wrong node.
 
NOIS NOL-0796-70230  If the data in the spool file was longer that 255
characters, it would cause an error in %ZIS4 on DSM systems.  This has
been fixed but the report may not print the way it would have if sent
directly to the printer.
 
NOIS WBP-0796-20862 When the number of spool documents is checked, only
those with data are counted. This is changed to count all spool documents 
with or without data.
 
E3R  --  Request for a way to have the current date as part of a auto 
generated name (GENERATE SPL DOC NAME).  Now if the device name includes
"|DT|" that string will be replaced with the current date.
 
E3R 8844  To include Person class in the User Inquiry.
 
NOIS IVM-1095-32452 Some times taskman doesn't release devices
when it should.
 
NOIS NOL-0996-70063 At a dual TaskMan site Problem starting tasks on
the working node. The TaskMan part of this patch was developed to address
problems at dual TaskMan sites after the install of patch 24. It is
unclear exactly what the problem was, but with load balancing work would
back up.  There is a new algorithm to start new submanagers and when
submanagers should exit.  We try and keep the number of submanagers  at a
level equal to a: the number of devices in the IO list.  b: the MIN
SUBMANAGER CNT. All submanagers will remain if the JOB list has any tasks
in it.
 
       -----   This patch adds two new fields to the TaskMan site
parameter file (14.7):  (1), MIN SUBMANAGER CNT, allows a site to set a
lower limit on the number of submanagers to keep around.  (2), TM MASTER,
is only used when a volume set is mounted on another but shares the
library account.  This is a pointer back to file 14.7 and would point to
the entry that is the control entry for TaskMan on that node.
 
Local MSG #1082921 
       DIC error in Add a New User.  Problem in the page numbering of the
new FORM for Add a New User and SECONDARY MENUS.  Sending out all three
FORMs with unified page numbering.
 
 
NOIS MAD-0895-40177 Some sites have some leftover nodes in the Institution 
file.
 
Collect more data in the standard error trap.
 
In patch 24 $X was set to zero before doing the close execute code.
This was changed to check if $X&gt;0 and to set it to 1 so that code (like
P-MESSAGE) that test $X would still work. 
 
If some package was installed after Kernel 8, the "ID" nodes on the
NEW PERSON file got changed back to an early version.  Nodes are reset.
 
NOIS IND-0996-41382 Changes to FTG^%ZISH made in XU*8*24 didn't work for
input like S Y=$$FTG^%ZISH("","TEST.DAT",$NA(OUT(0)),1) it did work
fine on S Y=$$FTG^%ZISH("","TEST.DAT",$NA(^TMP("XX",$J,0)),3). Fixed.
 
Various requests to bring back ZTMGRSET.  This new version will load all
all routines if called from the top, or only the routines with a given
patch number if called at RELOAD^ZTMGRSET.
 
NOIS BRK-1096-12512, CHW-0996-42161 While testing changes to %ZTER for
use with the new error trap we got ECODE errors under some conditions.
This has been fixed with a small change to %ZTER.

This patch adds changes and  enhancements to the Unwinder (XQOR*) in support 
of the Text Integration Utilities (TIU) package.  These changes include:

  1)  the ability to programmatically change the menu passed to XQOR

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;55 SEQ #44</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1997-02-17 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This is a reissue of Patch XU*8*14 without the code that requires the
users to change their E-SIG every 90 days.   You may install this patch
whether or not you previously installed XU*8*14.  (Sites who installed
XU*8*14 prior to it being marked 'Entered in Error' were advised that they
need not de-install the patch.)

The new E-SIG functions allow developers to follow the General Counsel's
guidelines on E-SIG.  The guidelines are the result of a meeting held in
Birmingham on 9/18-20/95.  A new routine, XUSESIG1, is included in this
patch.

Changes to the New Person file:
 Added a DEGREE field to hold MD, RN, LPN...
 Added a DATE E-SIG LAST CHANGED field. This field is just for on-line 
 documentation purposes.  Sites may use this field for local reporting 
 and management, but the Kernel does NOT perform any action aside 
 from updating the field when the E-sig is changed by the user.
 
The option XUSESIG BLOCK is included in this patch.
The forms XUEXISTING USER, XUREACT USER, and XUNEW USER are included in
the patch.  The new field DEGREE has been added to the Forms.
  
KERNEL functions to help developers.
 
$$CHKSUM^XUSESIG1($name_value,flag)
This EXTRINSIC FUNCTION will take a root ($name_value) and build a
checksum for all data in the root. (Not used now, flag would be used when
there is more than one checksum algorithm.) 

$$ESBLOCK^XUSESIG1(ien)
This extrinsic function will return the set of fields from the new 
person file that are needed as part of the hash for an acceptable E-Sig. 
If IEN is not passed in, then DUZ is used.
(E-Sig block, E-Sig title, Degree, Current Date/Time)
 
$$EN^XUSESIG1(checksum,esblock)
If the ESBLOCK is not passed then the function would get the ESBLOCK. In 
either case this extrinsic function would encode the ESBLOCK using the 
checksum as the KEY.  Returns an encoded string.  

$$CMP^XUSESIG1(checksum,$name_value)
This extrinsic function will compare the checksum passed in to the 
calculated value from the $NAME_VALUE.  Return 1 for match, 0 for no 
match.
 
$$DE^XUSESIG1(checksum,encoded_string)
This extrinsic function would decode the string using the checksum as 
the key.  Return a decoded string.

 2. The 'Compare Transport Global to Current System' will now let you compare
    just the Routines or just the 2nd line of the Routines.

EXAMPLE:
Select Kernel Installation &amp; Distribution System Option: Installation

Select Installation Option: Compare Transport Global to Current System

Select INSTALL NAME: TEST 2.2      Loaded from Distribution  2/26/97@13:04:56

          2         Second line of Routines only
          3         Routines only

Type of Compare: 2  Second line of Routines only
DEVICE: HOME// 


 3. When adding Options or Protocols to a Build, you now have 2 new 'Action
    Types': 4  ATTACH TO MENU and 5  DISABLE DURING INSTALL.
    ATTACH TO MENU should be used to attach an Option or Protocol that you
    are not exporting to a Menu you are exporting.
    DISABLE DURING INSTALL should be used to designate all the Options and
    Protocols that you are not exporting, but you want them put out of order
    during the install process.


 4. When a Mail Group is exported with KIDS, the installing user will be
    asked for the Mail Group Coordinator when they use the install option.
    The Coordinator will only be added to the Mail Group if the Mail Group
    is new or there is currently not a Coordinator.  The Mail Group Coordinator
    is optional.

EXAMPLE:
Select Kernel Installation &amp; Distribution System Option: Installation

Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The routine ORBSTAT was transported as a part of Kernel 8.0 to insure that
the alert statistics would perform correctly with the movement of alert
data from file 200 to file 8992.  Unfortunately, a couple of references to
file 200 were not converted, resulting in no output for the total alert
count.  This patch includes correction of these references within the
routine and a print template for file 8992 which is used by this routine.
 
========================================================================= 
Installation:
 
 1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
    option will load the KIDS package in this message onto your system.
 2. Answer NO to the question:
    'Shall I preserve what is on disk in a separate back-up message ?'
 3. From the 'Installion Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the option
    'Verify Checksums in Transport Global' and verify that all routines
    have the correct checksum.
 4. Inhibit users from login into the system. (If you install when few
    user are on the system and the posibility of some CLOBER errors is
    acceptable then users can stay on the system.)
 5. From the 'Installion Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the option
    'Install Package(s)' Select the package 'XU*8.0*7' and proceed with

 - The National Package install module on FORUM can now track patches.
  KIDS will now be able to update the module for patches.
 - Corrects a problem with multi-builds. When a multi-build contains more
  build names that can fit on one header line, a second header line is
  create.  The first build on the second line will begin with a colon, this
  will prevent the build from being installed.

resolves this by performing changes to the DD.
 
ISL-1196-50019                 When a system crashes, resources are left
and still allocated, preventing new jobs from starting.  This patch
provides a new option that can release all resources at startup (Clear all
Resources) and also an option to release a given slot on a resource (Clear
one Resource). New routine XUDHRES, change to ZIS6, ZISC.
 
MUR-0196-30539-XQ33            The option to delete unreferenced options
from the option file didn't check for options used in the new TaskMan
Schedule file. Added field 209.2 (KEEP FROM DELETING) to the option file.
 
CTX-0297-70559                 It was possible to get an earlier entry with
the Effective Date greater than the next entry.  This caused problems when
programes tried to find the current person class.  Fixed with a change to
the DD so only greater dates are allowed. 
 
 
CHANGES MADE IN RESPONSE TO REQUESTS:
 
When using the RJD option to stop a TaskMan job, you used to have to
DISPLAY the task before you could delete it.  Modification to routine
XUTMRJD was made to allow site to say NO to the display and still delete
the task from the running task list.  MSG 1060759 (Pete Tichenor)
 
Removes the testing for MWAPI from ZUMSM.  (Trouble calls)
 
Have XUS display the Node the user is on.  Changed the XUS routine to
display the Volume-set:Node rather than just the Volume-set alone.
Changed the first read to include output text as before in order to flush
the input buffer on certain systems, such as MSM.  (E3R 8568)
 
Cleans-up pointers to files 3,6,16,20 in sort and print templates.  It
adds checks to code of XUSERNEW, XUA4A7 so they are ready for file
3,6,16,20 cleanup.
 
Cleans up cross-references in files DEVICE, OPTION, and KERMIT HOLDING.
   
INVALID LOCK - This patch adds a timeout to the one lock without one.
Routine XUTMK was modified to resolve this problem.  (E3R #9278)
   
Updates the ID nodes of files 3.2 and 3.5 to use DDIOL.  Routine XUINPCH
   
Corrects a problem with the status code returned by STAT^%ZTLOAD.  It
formerly returned "Inactive: Interrupted" when it should have returned
"Active: Running". Fixed with changes to %ZTLOAD5.
 
Changes a call in %ZTMS3 from ZSYNC to PURGELST^%MSMOPS on MSM 4.3
systems.  In response to a request from MSM.
 
Changes the way ZTMS1 waits under load.
 
Changes %ZIS4 to clean up the IO("ERROR") and IO("LASTERR") variable.
 
This patch made a change to the setting of IO("ZIO"). ZIS4VXD, ZIS4MSM.
 
Changes PRIORITY code to keep jobs from assuming system priority.
(Capacity Management ZOSVMSM) 
 
Fix $$STATUS^%ZISH  not looking at the correct variable.
 
Improves the $STACK reporting on DSM systems.
 
Adds the following new entry point for modifying resource devices (please
see the Supported References file for full details):
$$RES^XUDHSET(device_name,resource_name,slot_count,description,subtype)
       device_name   For the resource device.
       resource_name (optional) The resource name if not the same as the device
                     name.
       slot_count    The number of concurrent jobs that can use this device.
                     defaults to 1.
       description   The device description, defaults to 'Resource Device'.
       subtype       The subtype to use, defaults to P-OTHER.
       returns       If an error '-1^text'
                     The 'IEN^device name' like a DIC call.

Installation:
 
  1.  Some of these routines are usually mapped on systems that allow 
      mapping, so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routines.
      
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
      
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
      On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
      
         Verify Checksum's in Transport Global
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This is the Auto Sign-on patch (aka Single Sign-on)
This patch has several Kernel routines as well as new fields in the Kernel
System parameteres file and the New Person file and the forms to edit
these files.  PLEASE be sure to edit the AUTO SIGN-ON field in the Kernel
System parameters file.  

*** This patch will increase the use of the LOCK table  ***
*** NOTE THAT AUTO SIGN-ON DOES NOT WORK ON MSM SYSTEMS ***

All of this work is in support of RPC Broker, CPRS and GUI clients.

There were some other fixes that had been applied to the routines and 
files needed by this patch so they are also fixed.
                     To the "Enter/Edit Kernel Site Parameters" form;
                     Added the AUTO SIGN-ON field to page 1,
                     Added the DEFAULT DIRECTORY FOR HFS field to page 3.

                     File 3.081 Field 1 changed from 15 to 30 characters.

*** Patch XU*8*59 MUST be installed before this patch           ***
 
A problem was found when using a Broker v1.0 application on Windows 95
and server side has Broker v1.1 with Auto sign-on.  The 16bit app will
prevent the server from contacting the ClientAgent, this will cause the
16 bit PCMM to time-out and close the sign-on.
The fix is to disable the auto sign-on if the client is Broker v1.0
 
It was found that the Broker sign-on were allowed even when Logon were
inhibited.
 
Both problems fixed by patching XUSRB
 
SFC-1197-61181  XUSRA  The SQLI interface was making use of a call in

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Enhancements to Unwinder routines (XQOR*) in support of CPRS 1.0
These enhancements include:
 
  1) A new parameter which may be passed to XQORM - XQORM("ALT")
     This allows the calling routine to supply an alternative lookup
     to be used if the user types something that does not appear on
     the menu.
 
  2) Fixed a bug that caused the menu to be exited if numeric ranges
     were allowed, the user erroneously entered something like 1-4B,
     and then typed a return at 'For entry 1-4B enter: ".
 
  3) Added "E" as a flag for XQORM(0).  It will allow ambiguous lookups
     to be resolved interactively when XQORM is called without XQORM(0)
     containing an "A".
 
  4) Made a change that sets full screen earlier when being called by
     list manager so that selection lists are properly displayed.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch was requested because of different errors that needed to be 
screened at the OpenM site.

This patch updates the error routines and Taskman to use a common place to
check to see if errors should NOT be recorded or should be screened from
the normal XTER listing.  The current ERROR MESSAGE file has been enhanced
to control this action.  The %ZTER routine checks the list and will not
record errors that are flagged not to record.
 
Sites can add their own entries to the file.  There is a field to allow
the advanced strings that Taskman has been using.  Current entries in
Taskmans error screen file are moved to the new file as part of the
install.

Prerequisites:
=========== 
     The following patches must be installed before this patch: 44
 
 
Subject:
======
     XU*8*60   CORRECT NAMESPACE PROBLEM/FIX MICROSURGERY
 
     When the routine XUSHSHP was written to hash the signature block in
     file 200, several local variables were used which were not within the
     Kernel namespace.  As would be expected, at least one of the
     variables is now another namespace and conflicts have arisen.  This
     patch uses the NEW command to limit the scope of these incorrectly
     namespaced variables to the code in which they are used, and will
     prevent future problems with other packages due to this error.
 
     Several alpha sites reported unusually high activity associated
     with the XUTL global.  This was identified as a problem related to 
     a spuriously high date value being set into the "AT" cross 
     reference in file 19.  Since this date was always ahead of NOW,
     micro-surgery would restart as soon as it had completed.  To 
     correct this problem, this patch contains a change to XQ83 which 
     will reset any of these spurious future nodes to NOW and stop this 
     excess activity.  A change is also made in XQ7 which will prevent 
     these nodes being set incorrectly in the future.
 
     There have also been some reports of problems [NOIS CLA-0397-22395]
     associated with the value of ZTCPU being reset as a result of a call
     to KICK^XQ7 during KIDS installations.  This problem is corrected by
     NEWING the value ZTCPU before it is used in KICK^XQ7.

     under the KIDS menu.  It will compare the checksums in the build 
     with the current checksums and list any that differ.
 
 
Installation Instructions:
===================
 
     1.   Users ARE allowed to be on the system during the 
          installation.  However, since XQ83 is referenced during the
          log-on procedure, BRIEFLY INHIBITING LOGONS while the patch is
          installed is recommended
     2.   DO NOT place TaskMan in a WAIT/STOP state. 
     3.   The routines in this patch are used in the background and
          will not normally affect journaling, compiled templates, or
          option usage.
     4.   These routines are usually mapped on systems that allow 
          mapping, so you will need to disable mapping for the affected
          routines.
     5.   Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. 
          This option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
     6.   The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your 
          system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport
          global.  
     7.   On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
             following options: 
 
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Print Transport Global 
           Compare Transport Global to Current System 
           Backup a Transport Global
           Install Package(s) 
           INSTALL NAME: XU*8.0*60
                                          =========
     8.   MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE 
                      routines to other CPUs?'. Enter the names of your 
                      Compute and Print server(s).
           AXP Sites - Answer NO to this question.
     9.   Rebuild your mapped set if necessary.

       arguments:  x  VA FileMan date
                   y  [optional] Affects output as follows:
               If '$D(y) then return standard VA FileMan format.
               If +y = 1 then return standard VA FileMan format.
               If +y = 2 then return MM/DD/YY@HH:MM:SS format.
               If +y = 3 then return DD/MM/YY@HH:MM:SS format.
               If +y = 4 then return YY/MM/DD@HH:MM:SS format.
               If +y = 5 then return MM/DD/YYYYHH:MM:SS format.
               If +y = 6 then return DD/MM/YYYY@HH:MM:SS format.
               If +y = 7 then return YYYY/MM/DD@HH:MM:SS format.
               If y contains "D" then Date only.
               If y contains "F" then output date with leading blanks.
               If y contains "P" then output "HH:MM:SS am/pm".
               If y contains "M" then output "HH:MM" only.
               If y contains "S" then force seconds in the output.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Enhancements to Unwinder routines (XQOR*) in support of CPRS 1.0
These enhancements include:
 
  1) A new parameter which may be passed to XQORM - XQORM("ALT")
     This allows the calling routine to supply an alternative lookup
     to be used if the user types something that does not appear on
     the menu.
 
  2) Fixed a bug that caused the menu to be exited if numeric ranges
     were allowed, the user erroneously entered something like 1-4B,
     and then typed a return at 'For entry 1-4B enter: ".
 
  3) Added "E" as a flag for XQORM(0).  It will allow ambiguous lookups
     to be resolved interactively when XQORM is called without XQORM(0)
     containing an "A".
 
  4) Made a change that sets full screen earlier when being called by
     list manager so that selection lists are properly displayed.

                ZTER    Change to allow OpenM sites to use the new error
                        trapping.  The check was conditional because early
                        versions didn't support this.  Then OpenM started
                        changing its name with each version. Fixed to remove
                        version checking, assume all VA site running current

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch was requested because of different errors that needed to be 
screened at the OpenM site.

This patch updates the error routines and Taskman to use a common place to
check to see if errors should NOT be recorded or should be screened from
the normal XTER listing.  The current ERROR MESSAGE file has been enhanced
to control this action.  The %ZTER routine checks the list and will not
record errors that are flagged not to record.
 
Sites can add their own entries to the file.  There is a field to allow
the advanced strings that Taskman has been using.  Current entries in
Taskmans error screen file are moved to the new file as part of the
install.

Installation:

 1.  Some of these routines are usually mapped on systems that allow mapping,
     so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routines. 
     
 2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
     option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
     
 3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
     system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
     
 4.  Inhibit users from login into the system. (If you install when few
      user are on the system and the possibility of some CLOBER/EDITED
      errors is acceptable then users can stay on the system.)

     
 5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
     options:
     
        Verify Checksum's in Transport Global
        Print Transport Global
        Compare Transport Global to Current System      
        Backup a Transport Global
        Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*65'
                             =========
        
 6.  After installing this patch, 
      DSM/MSM sites - you need to move several routines from 
      your production account to each manager account:
      OpenM Sites - you don't need to move anything, skip this step.

      ZISHMSM
      ZISHONT
      ZISHVXD
      ZOSFVXD
      ZOSVVXD
    
      And in the manager account,  (OpenM sites remain in VAH)
      
      All sites:
      DO RELOAD^ZTMGRSET
      Select the System
      Patch number to load: 65
                            ==

 7.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.

 8.   Enable user's login.

<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1997-03-27 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Prerequisites:
=========== 
     The following patches must be installed before this patch: 44
 
 
Subject:
======
     XU*8*60   CORRECT NAMESPACE PROBLEM/FIX MICROSURGERY
 
     When the routine XUSHSHP was written to hash the signature block in
     file 200, several local variables were used which were not within the
     Kernel namespace.  As would be expected, at least one of the
     variables is now another namespace and conflicts have arisen.  This
     patch uses the NEW command to limit the scope of these incorrectly
     namespaced variables to the code in which they are used, and will
     prevent future problems with other packages due to this error.
 
     Several alpha sites reported unusually high activity associated
     with the XUTL global.  This was identified as a problem related to 
     a spuriously high date value being set into the "AT" cross 
     reference in file 19.  Since this date was always ahead of NOW,
     micro-surgery would restart as soon as it had completed.  To 
     correct this problem, this patch contains a change to XQ83 which 
     will reset any of these spurious future nodes to NOW and stop this 
     excess activity.  A change is also made in XQ7 which will prevent 
     these nodes being set incorrectly in the future.
 
     There have also been some reports of problems [NOIS CLA-0397-22395]
     associated with the value of ZTCPU being reset as a result of a call
     to KICK^XQ7 during KIDS installations.  This problem is corrected by
     NEWING the value ZTCPU before it is used in KICK^XQ7.

     To test if the transport has been corrupted, you can use the 
     "Verify Package Integrity" option.  This option is under Utilities 
     under the KIDS menu.  It will compare the checksums in the build 
     with the current checksums and list any that differ.
 
 
Installation Instructions:
===================
 
     1.   Users ARE allowed to be on the system during the 
          installation.  However, since XQ83 is referenced during the
          log-on procedure, BRIEFLY INHIBITING LOGONS while the patch is
          installed is recommended
     2.   DO NOT place TaskMan in a WAIT/STOP state. 
     3.   The routines in this patch are used in the background and
          will not normally affect journaling, compiled templates, or
          option usage.
     4.   These routines are usually mapped on systems that allow 
          mapping, so you will need to disable mapping for the affected
          routines.
     5.   Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. 
          This option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
     6.   The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your 
          system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport
          global.  
     7.   On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
             following options: 
 
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Print Transport Global 
           Compare Transport Global to Current System 
           Backup a Transport Global
           Install Package(s) 
           INSTALL NAME: XU*8.0*60
                                          =========
     8.   MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE 
                      routines to other CPUs?'. Enter the names of your 
                      Compute and Print server(s).
           AXP Sites - Answer NO to this question.
     9.   Rebuild your mapped set if necessary.

       arguments:  x  VA FileMan date
                   y  [optional] Affects output as follows:
               If '$D(y) then return standard VA FileMan format.
               If +y = 1 then return standard VA FileMan format.
               If +y = 2 then return MM/DD/YY@HH:MM:SS format.
               If +y = 3 then return DD/MM/YY@HH:MM:SS format.
               If +y = 4 then return YY/MM/DD@HH:MM:SS format.
               If +y = 5 then return MM/DD/YYYYHH:MM:SS format.
               If +y = 6 then return DD/MM/YYYY@HH:MM:SS format.
               If +y = 7 then return YYYY/MM/DD@HH:MM:SS format.
               If y contains "D" then Date only.
               If y contains "F" then output date with leading blanks.

the dependency with Kernel, this was our mistake.
 
 
        ZISTCPS      This is a new routine that has the general TCP/IP
                     server for OpenM in it.  This function was moved
                     to help standardize the call in %ZISTCP.
                     The MailMan listener for OpenM was changed to reflect
                     this change.  The two patched got out of sync.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;67 SEQ #62</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1998-04-28 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
**** This patch will add to the number of entries in the LOCK table. ****
**** Depending on the number of jobs on a system node the Lock table ****
**** may need to be increased.                                       ****

 Certain long running task (i.e. HL7 filers and LLP's) are getting removed 
 from the system by the daily 'job' and 'Taskman' clean-up routines even 
 though they are still active.  Taskman has been modified to lock the 
 ^%ZTSCH("TASK",tasknumber) node when starting a task and release the lock 
 at completion.  The clean-up routines will now attempt to lock this node to 
 determine if the task is still active.
  
 These problems were reported in the following NOIS's:  MAR-1196-20400, 
 CMO-1196-41389, WNY-1296-11772, MAD-0197-40149, ISH-0197-41376, 
 HIN-0297-41185.
  
 In addition to being tested locally, the following sites tested this patch:
  
  Baltimore VAMC, Dayton VAMC, Columbia VAMC
  
WNY-1296-11772, CMO-1196-41389, MAR-1196-20400
HIN-0297-41185 ZTMS3   Prevent TaskMan and Kernel clean-up programs from 
ISH-0197-41376          blowing away tasks that need to run for long periods
MAD-0197-40149  XUTMK   of time.  This requires that tasks only use 
                XUTMRJD INCREMENTAL locks.
                                
Long time requests for tasks that restart themselfas if they stop unexpectedly.
Part of the problem has been to know when a TASK is running.  The change to 
prevent clean-up programs from deleting the info about long running tasks
puts into place the needed part so that taskman can check and restart tasks
that need to be persistent.

SFC-1197-60720   ZTMS2  Taskman would not check the device file OUT-OF-SERVICE
                 ZTMS3  field.  This was caused by DT not being set at the time
                 ZTMS   of the call to %ZIS.

ZTLOAD has two new supported tags.

$$PSET^%ZTLOAD to set a task as persistent.  Returns 1 if the flag is set other
wise returns 0.
PCLEAR^%ZTLOAD to clear the persistent flag for a task.

========================================================================= 
Installation:

  1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
      so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routines.
      
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
      
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
      On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
      
         Verify Checksum's in Transport Global
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
         
 4.   Inhibit users from login into the system. (If you install when few
      user are on the system and the possibility of some CLOBER errors is
      acceptable then users can stay on the system.)
      Also place TASKMAN in a wait state.
      
  5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      option:
         Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*67'
                              =========
         
  7.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
      other CPUs?'. Enter the names of your Compute and Print server(s).
      MSM Sites - With Taskman not working you need to move the routine to
      other CPU's with the D ^XPDCPU
      
  8.  After installing this patch, 
      DSM/MSM sites - you need to move several routines from 
      your production account to each manager account:
      OpenM Sites - you don't need to move anything, skip this step.
      ZTLOAD
      ZTLOAD3
      ZTLOAD7
      ZTM
      ZTM0
      ZTMS
      ZTMS2
      ZTMS3

      And in the manager account,  (OpenM sites remain in VAH)
       
      All sites:
      DO RELOAD^ZTMGRSET
      Select the System
      Patch number to load: 67
                            ==
       
  9.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
 10.  Enable user's login.
      Remove TASKMAN from the wait state.

                     XU*8*46 - Jump Problems and XQUIT
 
     There are no associated patches.
 
     This patch contains 22 routines, a new Kernel File (Menu Systen Quick
Help), 13 Help Frames, and 3 Options; which fix a couple of problems with
jumping.  Under certain circumstances the Entry Action and Header would
not be executed for the parent option of a secondary menu tree and the
XUCOMMAND option which is the parent of the Common Options.  In addition,
the headers were occasionally executed before the entry action rather than
after the entry action, the latter always being the correct sequence.
[NOIS DAY-0994-40200, SPO-0597-50637]
 
     This patch also synchronizes the single uparrow jump ("^") and the
double uparrow or rubber-band jump ("^^") so that both react the same
when the variable XQUIT is set during the execution of an Entry Action.
[NOIS DAY-0596-41019].
 
     The  program ^XQDATE has been modified to correct a flaw that could
make time stand still by not cleaning up after itself.
[NOIS BRX-0498-10234, CMO-0498-40588].
 
 
     Patch 46 also includes an enhancement to XQUIT processing. If XQUIT
is encountered in a jump path the software will return the user to the
option the user jumped from rather than stopping in mid-jump.  It Also
required the inclusion of a Screen-based Option Editor (OPED).  Please see
the option "Kernel New Features Help" for a complete look at these
features.
  
     This patch contains the routine XQP46INI, a post install routine,
that may be deleted after the install.

       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
   3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your 
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  
   4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following 
       options: 
          Print Transport Global 
          Compare Transport Global to Current System 
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
          Backup a Transport Global
          Install Package(s) 
   5.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to 
       other CPUs?'. Enter the names of your Compute and Print server(s).
   6.  Rebuild your mapped set if necessary.
   7.  If users are allowed to remain on the system during installation
       errors may occur when the routines are loaded.

  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
     
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
      On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
      
         Verify Checksum's in Transport Global
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
     
  4.  Inhibit users from login into the system. (If you install when few
      user are on the system and the possibility of some CLOBER errors is
      acceptable then users can stay on the system.)
     
  5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      option:
        Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*75'
                             =========
        
     
  6.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set and
      enable user logins.

DESCRIPTION
============
KIDS patch XU*8*68 fixed a bug when protocols were "Deleted at Site" resulting 
in broken (dangling) pointers within the PROTOCOL file (#101).  Patch XU*8*80 
will give sites the ability to periodically search the PROTOCOL file for 
broken pointers and execute a routine (ENASK^XQ3) to automatically remove 
them.  However, patches that were installed prior to XU*8*68 that deleted 
protocols will need to be MANUALLY checked to ensure that a newly-created 
protocol did not take the place of the deleted, one covering up the broken 
pointer.
 
NOTE: It is important to note that the PROTOCOL file has the same structure as 
the OPTION file (#19) whereas field #10, ITEM corresponds to field #10, MENU, 
in the OPTION file.  Field #10, ITEM is a multiple and a pointer to the .01 
field of the parent file. 
 
 
Three patches that deleted protocols have been identified.  The protocols 
deleted in these patches may have resulted in broken pointers.  However, there 
is a possibility that a newly created protocol could reuse same IEN as the 
deleted one, and thus cover-up the broken pointer.   Sites will need to 
manually ensure that a newly created protocol hasn't overwritten any of the 
broken ones.  The three patches are identified below along with ITEM's (field 
#10 multiple) that one can reasonably expect to find attached to the 
protocols.  Figures 1-5 below the ITEM listings are simulations where two 
broken pointers were created and one was covered up with a newly created 
protocol.  The STEPs associated with the figures are the actions needed to 
cleanup the PROTOCOL file.

STEP 2: Broken pointers can be easily identified because a numeric will appear 
in the ITEM field.  The routine XQ3 (shown in figure 4) will clean these up.  
You must verify that the others actually should be connected to this protocol.

STEP 3: In the above figure (Figure 3), it was verify that the 1st ITEM, 
ZZKYLE ACTION 1, should be attached to this protocol.  The 2nd ITEM, ZZJACK, 
is discovered to belong to a different protocol entry and should be removed 
from this entry.  Use FM to manually remove it from the multiple attached to 
this protocol (shown in figure 5).  The 3rd ITEM is broken and XQ3 will clean 
it out (shown in figure 4).  The 4th ITEM is verified as valid.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch is in support of CIRN.  It will add fields to the Institution
file, an entry to the Facility Type file, and add new Institution file
associations.
**NOTE: It will add all 22 VISN's in the format 'VISN xx' and
build the associations for each station in that VISN.

There is a new form OPTION; EVE:OPERATIONS:KERNEL:INSTITUTION to edit the
Institution file.

Includes a routine with several APIs for the CIRN developers to use.

Supported References

PARENT^XUAF4(array, station, association) - for a specified institution which 
is the parent for this association type.

INPUT Variables
Array - As input, it is the $NAME reference for the Array name you want 
    results back in. (This needs to be in your namespace)
Station - The lookup value - either ien, station number, station name.
   If IEN it will need to have the ` in front of it.
Association - The type of assocation from the Institution Association Types 
    file.  (in CIRN's case it is = VISN) 

Output Variable - array("p",ien)=station name ^ station number

Note: We have a business rule that institution can only have one parent per
association.

SIBLING^XUAF4(array, child ,association) - all sibling institutions of a
 given institution of a given association.

INPUT Variables
Array - As input it is the $NAME reference for the Array name you want 
    results back in. (This needs to be in your namespace)
Child - The lookup value - either ien, station number, station name. 
    If IEN it will need to have the ` in front of it.
Association - The type of assocation from the Institution Association Types 
    file.  (in CIRN's case it is = VISN)

Output Variable - array("p",pien,"c",cien)=station name ^ station number

Note: We have a business rule that institution can only have one parent per
association.

CHILDREN^XUAF4(array, parent, association) - for a specified parent return a 
   list of all child institutions for a given association.
 
Input Variables 
Array - As input it is the $NAME reference for the Array name you want
   results back in. (This needs to be in your namespace)
Parent - The lookup value either ien, station number, station name. 
   If IEN it will need to have the ` in front of it.
Association - The type of assocation from the Institution Association Types 
   file.  (in CIRN's case it is = VISN)
    
Output Variable - array ("c" , ien)=station name ^ station number

NNT^XUAF4(ien) - 
   This will return the station name ^ station number ^ station type
   IEN - The pointer value into file 4.

CIRN^XUAF4(inst [,value]) - This function returns the value of the CIRN 
   enabled field from the institution file.

inst - The pointer value (IEN) into file 4.

value - (optional) Restricted to use by CIRN. This allows the setting of the
   field to a new value (Yes, No or @ to delete)

Output - "Yes", "No" or the empty string

Installation:

  1.  DSM sites - New routine.
     
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
     
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
      On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
      
         Verify Checksum's in Transport Global
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
     
 4.  Users can remain on the system. This patch can be loaded any
     non-peek time.
     
  5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      option:
        Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*43'

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch is being released by Capacity Management (CM) in anticipation
of the national release of the Resource Usage Monitor (RUM) Version 1.0
and Statistical Analysis of Global Growth (SAGG) Version 1.8 software
packages.
 
This patch will not affect the current versions of the RUM and SAGG
software that is running at the sites.  Therefore, all DSM, MSM and
OpenM-NT sites are instructed to install this patch.  Sites which had a
pre-release of SAGG v 1.8 should also install this patch.
 
This patch in conjunction with the future release of SAGG v 1.8 will
support the collection of global growth data from the following operating
system platforms: DSM, MSM and OpenM-NT.
 
This patch distribution will be adding new %ZOSV* routines to the system
specific manager routine set.  The accompanying installation instructions
will guide you in adding these routines to your system.
 
This distribution also contains two routines within the new KMP*
namespace:
 
   KMPENV      An environment check routine which determines which system
               specific collection routines should be installed.  The
               system variable ^%ZOSF("OS") will be used to determine the
               type of sysem on which this distribution is running.
 
   KMPLOAD     A loader routine that will be used to rename the ZOSVK*
               routines to %ZOSVK*.
 
The KMP* namespace has been designated for the use of Capacity Management
routines.  Both of these routines are only necessary for the installation
of this distribution and can be deleted after successful completion of
this patch.
 
 
Installation:
============
 
The installation of this patch does not affect any options.  Therefore,
this installation can be performed at any time of the day with minimal
disruption to users.  Provided the information that is listed immediately
below does NOT apply to your site's configuration, installation should not
take longer than 10-15 minutes.
 
 
NOTE:  If you are an 'OpenM-NT' site, review the 'NOTE' section in Step 7
       to determine if additional preparation work is necessary.
 
 
  1.   You will not need to review your mapped routine sets.
 
 
  2.   Load the patch distribution onto your system by following these
       instructions:
 
       Enter 'X' at the 'Select MESSAGE Action: IGNORE//' (or DELETE//)
       mail prompt and select the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option.
 
 
  3.   From the 'Kernel Installation &amp; Distribution System' (KIDS) menu,
       select the 'Installation' menu.
 
 
  4.   You may now elect to use the following options: 
 
             When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter XU*8.0*90
                                                       =========
 
       a.    Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
             message of any routines exported with this release.  It will
             NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
 
       b.    Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
             allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
             release is installed.  It compares all components of the
             release (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
 
       c.    Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
             you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
             transport global.
 
 
  5.   Use the 'Install Package(s)' option and select the package
       XU*8.0*90.
       =========
 
 
  6.   When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', you can respond with NO.
 
 
  7.   If you are either a 'DSM for OpenVMS' or 'MSM-DOS' site, after
       successful completion of the installation, move and restore the
       KMPLOAD and ZOSVK* routines to the MGR UCI(s) with the ^%RS and
       ^%RR system routines.
 
       If you are a 'MSM-DOS' site, you must also move these routines to
       all MGR UCIs on every CPU, such as, compute, print, file and shadow
       servers.   
 
 
       NOTE:   If you are a 'OpenM-NT' site, you must verify that the
               routine mapping configuration on each of your NT system(s)
               contains %ZO* or, at least, %ZOSV*.
 
               You MUST review the mapping configuration on ALL of your
               NT-VISTA Network configuration files (i.e., VANETA.DEF and
               VANETB.DEF).
 
               If needed, you will also need to modify ALL of your
               NT-VISTA Network configuration files (i.e., VANETA.DEF and
               VANETB.DEF).
 
               Use the following instructions to complete this task:
 
               On the 'Open M NextGen Thin Client' buttons, click on the
               'Configure Open M' (i.e., Wizard) button.
 
               On the top menu line of the 'Open M Configurations' window:
 
                  Select File
                         -
                    Edit Network Configuration...
 
               On the top menu line of the 'Open M - Namespace/Network
               Configuration' window:
 
                  Select File
                         -
                    Open Configuration [Remote]...
 
               A 'Choose Connection' window opens:
 
                  Choose the appropriate 'Connection' to your NT system
 
                    Click the 'OK' button
 
               Select the correct system from the 'File Name' box
 
               *** You will need to review ALL of your ***
               ***         VISTA configurations        ***
 
                    Click the 'OK' button
 
               Click on the 'Routine Mapping' radial button  -&gt; o
 
               Review the entries and ensure that the following is
               present:
 
                Routines       Type      Destination Location
                --------       ----      --------------------
                %ZO*           ALL       ROU
        (or, at least, %ZOSV*)
 
               If the above is present, continue to Step 8.
 
               However, if the above is NOT present, click the 'Insert
               Mapping' button and add %ZO* to the routine mapping list.
 
               Then, on the top menu line of the 'Open M Namespace/Network
               Configuration' window:
 
                  Select File
                         -
                    Save Configuration
 
               Restart OpenM after making this change on ALL VISTA
               configurations of the OpenM-NT cluster.
 
               Review ALL of your NT-VISTA configurations and make the
               appropriate modifications, if necessary.
 
               After restarting your OpenM systems, you will log into the
               VAH UCI to complete the next step.
 
 
  8.   All sites must run the KMPLOAD routine in order to rename the
       system specific collection routines to the %ZOSVK-namespace.
 
 
       NOTE:   If you are a 'DSM for OpenVMS' site, you must have
               performed Step 7 and be logged into the MCR UCI in order to
               complete this step as shown below.
 
       NOTE:   If you are a 'MSM-DOS' site, you must have performed Step 7
               and be logged into the MGR UCI.  You must run this routine
               on all MGR UCIs on every CPU, such as, compute, print, file
               and shadow servers as shown below.
 
       NOTE:   If you are an 'OpenM-NT' site, you must have verified the
               routine mapping for every node configuration as outlined in
               Step 7.  You must be logged into the VAH UCI in order to
               complete this step as shown below.
 
 
       Now, once logged into the appropiate UCI as defined above for your
       site, run the KMPLOAD routine.
 
       &gt; D ^KMPLOAD
 
         Loading ZOSVKRx      Saved as %ZOSVKR
         Loading ZOSVKSxE     Saved as %ZOSVKSE
         Loading ZOSVKSxS     Saved as %ZOSVKSS
 
         Finished
 
 
       NOTE:  The above listing of routines is only shown as an example.
              The listing that you will obtain will vary depending on your
              system configuration.
 
 
  9.   The KMP* and %ZOSVK* namespaced routines are NOT recommended to
       be mapped.

                         the resource slot sub-file zero node. This has
                         been fixed, The post init will clean-up the
                         ^%ZIS(3.54,n,1,0) nodes.  The TRIGGER X-ref
                         on the $I field of the device file was forceing
                         new entries into the resource file.  This has
                         been fixed and the extra entries will be removed
                         in the post init.

With this Kernel patch we have deleted fields *FORM FEED, *BACK SPACE from 
the device file.  Removed the asterik from fields *MARGIN WIDTH, *PAGE LENGTH 
in the device file while changing the way they work
 
First, the X-ref that stuffs these fields when the SUBTYPE field is edited
will be removed so that the MARGIN WIDTH and PAGE LENGTH fields can act as
overrides to the Terminal Type file fields.
 
This way if the terminal type file is edited all devices that point to
this entry will get the new values right away, without having to re-index
the subtype field of the device file.
 
If a particular device has the same characteristics as others of the same
type but has a different paper size, a new terminal type will not be
needed.

========================================================================= 
Installation:

  1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
      so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routines.
      
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
      
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
      On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
      
         Verify Checksum's in Transport Global
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
         
 4.   Inhibit users from login into the system. (If you install when few
      user are on the system and the possibility of some CLOBER errors is
      acceptable then users can stay on the system.)
      Also place TASKMAN in a wait state.
      
  5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      option:
         Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*69'
                              =========
         
  7.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
      other CPUs?'. Enter the names of your Compute and Print server(s).
      
  8.  After installing this patch, 
      DSM/MSM sites - you need to move several routines from 
      your production account to each manager account:
      OpenM Sites - you don't need to move anything, skip this step.
      ZIS,ZIS1,ZIS2,ZIS3,ZIS5,ZIS6,ZISC
      ZIS4MSM,ZIS4VXD,ZIS4ONT
      ZISS,ZISS1,ZISS2,ZISP
      ZISUTL
      ZISTCP
      ZTMGRSET
      And in the manager account,  (OpenM sites remain in VAH)
       
      All sites:
      DO RELOAD^ZTMGRSET
      Select the System
      Patch number to load: 69
                            ==
       
  9.  MSM sites move these routines to the MGR accounts on other CPU's.
  
 10.  ALL sites move routine XUINPCH to all other accounts that share the
      %ZIS global and "D POST69^XUINPCH" to clean-up the DD for that account.
      
 11.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
 
 12.  Enable user's login.
      Remove Taskman from WAIT State.

     Patch XU*8*46 should be installed before this one.
 
     This patch contains two new fields to the Option File
XQUIT MESSAGE and XQUIT EXECUTABLE that were inadvertently
left out of Patch XU*8*46.  The documentation for using
these fields is found in the option Kernel New Features.
     This patch also contians a simgle routine that fixes
a bug that went out with that patch.  Dayton discovered
that XQUIT processing did not work with queued options.
Frankly, it never occurred to me that XQUIT would be 
used in that manner.  They were publishing a report that
they did not want on holidays, so they set the XQUIT 
variable in the Entry Action if it was a holiday.
  
     Checksums were obtained using CHECK^XTSUMBLD.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;90</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1998-09-03 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch is being released by Capacity Management (CM) in anticipation
of the national release of the Resource Usage Monitor (RUM) Version 1.0
and Statistical Analysis of Global Growth (SAGG) Version 1.8 software
packages.
 
This patch will not affect the current versions of the RUM and SAGG
software that is running at the sites.  Therefore, all DSM, MSM and
OpenM-NT sites are instructed to install this patch.  Sites which had a
pre-release of SAGG v 1.8 should also install this patch.
 
This patch in conjunction with the future release of SAGG v 1.8 will
support the collection of global growth data from the following operating
system platforms: DSM, MSM and OpenM-NT.
 
This patch distribution will be adding new %ZOSV* routines to the system
specific manager routine set.  The accompanying installation instructions
will guide you in adding these routines to your system.
 
This distribution also contains two routines within the new KMP*
namespace:
 
   KMPENV      An environment check routine which determines which system
               specific collection routines should be installed.  The
               system variable ^%ZOSF("OS") will be used to determine the
               type of sysem on which this distribution is running.
 
   KMPLOAD     A loader routine that will be used to rename the ZOSVK*
               routines to %ZOSVK*.
 
The KMP* namespace has been designated for the use of Capacity Management
routines.  Both of these routines are only necessary for the installation
of this distribution and can be deleted after successful completion of
this patch.
 
 
Installation:
============
 
The installation of this patch does not affect any options.  Therefore,
this installation can be performed at any time of the day with minimal
disruption to users.  Provided the information that is listed immediately
below does NOT apply to your site's configuration, installation should not
take longer than 10-15 minutes.
 
 
NOTE:  If you are an 'OpenM-NT' site, review the 'NOTE' section in Step 7
       to determine if additional preparation work is necessary.
 
 
  1.   You will not need to review your mapped routine sets.
 
 
  2.   Load the patch distribution onto your system by following these
       instructions:
 
       Enter 'X' at the 'Select MESSAGE Action: IGNORE//' (or DELETE//)
       mail prompt and select the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option.
 
 
  3.   From the 'Kernel Installation &amp; Distribution System' (KIDS) menu,
       select the 'Installation' menu.
 
 
  4.   You may now elect to use the following options: 
 
             When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter XU*8.0*90
                                                       =========
 
       a.    Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
             message of any routines exported with this release.  It will
             NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
 
       b.    Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
             allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
             release is installed.  It compares all components of the
             release (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
 
       c.    Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
             you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
             transport global.
 
 
  5.   Use the 'Install Package(s)' option and select the package
       XU*8.0*90.
       =========
 
 
  6.   When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', you can respond with NO.
 
 
  7.   If you are either a 'DSM for OpenVMS' or 'MSM-DOS' site, after
       successful completion of the installation, move and restore the
       KMPLOAD and ZOSVK* routines to the MGR UCI(s) with the ^%RS and
       ^%RR system routines.
 
       If you are a 'MSM-DOS' site, you must also move these routines to
       all MGR UCIs on every CPU, such as, compute, print, file and shadow
       servers.   
 
 
       NOTE:   If you are a 'OpenM-NT' site, you must verify that the
               routine mapping configuration on each of your NT system(s)
               contains %ZO* or, at least, %ZOSV*.
 
               You MUST review the mapping configuration on ALL of your
               NT-VISTA Network configuration files (i.e., VANETA.DEF and
               VANETB.DEF).
 
               If needed, you will also need to modify ALL of your
               NT-VISTA Network configuration files (i.e., VANETA.DEF and
               VANETB.DEF).
 
               Use the following instructions to complete this task:
 
               On the 'Open M NextGen Thin Client' buttons, click on the
               'Configure Open M' (i.e., Wizard) button.
 
               On the top menu line of the 'Open M Configurations' window:
 
                  Select File
                         -
                    Edit Network Configuration...
 
               On the top menu line of the 'Open M - Namespace/Network
               Configuration' window:
 
                  Select File
                         -
                    Open Configuration [Remote]...
 
               A 'Choose Connection' window opens:
 
                  Choose the appropriate 'Connection' to your NT system
 
                    Click the 'OK' button
 
               Select the correct system from the 'File Name' box
 
               *** You will need to review ALL of your ***
               ***         VISTA configurations        ***
 
                    Click the 'OK' button
 
               Click on the 'Routine Mapping' radial button  -&gt; o
 
               Review the entries and ensure that the following is
               present:
 
                Routines       Type      Destination Location
                --------       ----      --------------------
                %ZO*           ALL       ROU
        (or, at least, %ZOSV*)
 
               If the above is present, continue to Step 8.
 
               However, if the above is NOT present, click the 'Insert
               Mapping' button and add %ZO* to the routine mapping list.
 
               Then, on the top menu line of the 'Open M Namespace/Network
               Configuration' window:
 
                  Select File
                         -
                    Save Configuration
 
               Restart OpenM after making this change on ALL VISTA
               configurations of the OpenM-NT cluster.
 
               Review ALL of your NT-VISTA configurations and make the
               appropriate modifications, if necessary.
 
               After restarting your OpenM systems, you will log into the
               VAH UCI to complete the next step.
 
 
  8.   All sites must run the KMPLOAD routine in order to rename the
       system specific collection routines to the %ZOSVK-namespace.
 
 
       NOTE:   If you are a 'DSM for OpenVMS' site, you must have
               performed Step 7 and be logged into the MCR UCI in order to
               complete this step as shown below.
 
       NOTE:   If you are a 'MSM-DOS' site, you must have performed Step 7
               and be logged into the MGR UCI.  You must run this routine
               on all MGR UCIs on every CPU, such as, compute, print, file
               and shadow servers as shown below.
 
       NOTE:   If you are an 'OpenM-NT' site, you must have verified the
               routine mapping for every node configuration as outlined in
               Step 7.  You must be logged into the VAH UCI in order to
               complete this step as shown below.
 
 
       Now, once logged into the appropiate UCI as defined above for your
       site, run the KMPLOAD routine.
 
       &gt; D ^KMPLOAD
 
         Loading ZOSVKRx      Saved as %ZOSVKR
         Loading ZOSVKSxE     Saved as %ZOSVKSE
         Loading ZOSVKSxS     Saved as %ZOSVKSS
 
         Finished
 
 
       NOTE:  The above listing of routines is only shown as an example.
              The listing that you will obtain will vary depending on your
              system configuration.
 
 
  9.   The KMP* and %ZOSVK* namespaced routines are NOT recommended to
       be mapped.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
For ALPHA/NT OpenM/Cache sites, these routines were included in
the KRN_ONT_34.RTN file(s) that were used as part of the conversion
process to OpenM/Cache. This file went through several revisions 
during the course of the project so depending on when a site
converted, the old checksums for these routines may vary from what
this patch indicates.  Avaliable Jobs and Act Jobs adjusted to work
with both OpenM (NextGen Build52e) and Cache.

This patch is only needed by OpenM sites, Installing at other sites
will not cause any problems.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch is in support of the new Capacity Management namespace KMPR.
The Kernel routines will call ^%ZOSVKR through %ZOSV and the XQOR routines
will call %ZOSVKR directly.

The %ZOSV routine has been modified to call the new %ZOSVKR routine.
This should help protect folks outside of the VA who use VistA.
 
The ZTMGRSET routine has been updated to save the new routine under the
correct name.

The ZOSVKR* and ZOSVKS* are included unchanged at the request of the DBA.
These routines were introduced with patch XU*8*90.  Patch XU*8*90
installed certain ZOSVKR* and ZOSVKS* routines based on your platform's
operating system.  Please do not be alarmed if you are notified prior to
installing patch XU*8*94 that certain ZOSVKR* and ZOSVKS* routine do not
exist in your account.

MWV-0398-21933  ZTMS3  Add to the after task cleanup IO("P"),IO("DOC")
                       so they can't upset re-queuing of following tasks.

========================================================================= 
Installation:

  1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
      so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
      
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
      
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
      On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
      
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
         
 4.   Inhibit users from login into the system. (If you install when few
      users are on the system and the possibility of some CLOBER errors is
      acceptable, then users can stay on the system.)
      Also place TASKMAN in a wait state, and stop submanagers.
      
  5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      option:
         Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*94'
                              =========
                              
        No Options or Protocols need to be placed out-of-order.
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO
                                                                        ==
      
  6.  After installing this patch, 
      DSM sites rename ZUVXD to ZU.
      OpenM sites rename ZUONT to ZU.
      MSM sites rename ZUMSM to ZU.
      
  7.  OpenM Sites - you don't need to move anything, skip this step.
      DSM/MSM sites - you need to move several routines from 
      your production account to each manager account:
      
      ZTMGRSET
      ZTMS
      ZTMS3
      ZOSVMSM
      ZOSVONT
      ZOSVVXD
      ZOSVKRM
      ZOSVKRO
      ZOSVKRV
      ZOSVKSME
      ZOSVKSMS
      ZOSVKSOE
      ZOSVKSOS
      ZOSVKSVE
      ZOSVKSVS

  8.  And in the manager account,  (OpenM sites remain in VAH)
      All sites:
      DO RELOAD^ZTMGRSET
      Select the System
      Patch number to load: 94
                            ==
       
  9.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
 10.  Enable user's login.
      Remove TASKMAN from the wait state.

ISL-0598-50691   XUSRB  When a GUI-Broker process exited the M system
                        it failed to clean-up the temp globals
                        as roll and scroll M processes do.
                        
                        It was discovered that not all local Broker 
                        development was making the call to establish 
                        an application context.  They were just adding
                        the local RPC to the SIGN-ON context.  This 
                        loophole has been fixed by having sign-on remove
                        its context when completing the sign-on.
                        
                 XQCS   These two routines improve the interface between 
                 XQSET  the Remote Proceedure Call (RPC) Broker and the 
                        traditional Menu System.  With this patch installed 
                        sites will be able to mark Broker-type options 
                        out-of-order, lock them with keys and reverse keys, 
                        and restrict the days and times during which they 
                        are allowed to run.

Sites should use CHECK^XTSUMBLD to verify checksums

============================================================================
Installation:

  1.  DSM sites - One of these routines are usually mapped,
      so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines. 
     
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
     
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
      On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
      
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
     
  4.  Inhibit users from login into the system. (If you install when few
      users are on the system and the possibility of some CLOBER errors are
      acceptable in the XQALFWD routine, then users can stay on the system.)
     
  5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      option:
        Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*91'
                             =========
                             
        No Options or Protocols need to be placed out-of-order.
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO
                                                                        ==
     
  6.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.

BRX-0898-12101  ZIS2    If a device had the Out Of Service field set, the
                        user was asked if this was OK.  The outcome was that
                        the user could queue to a device that was OOS.
                        This change will make OOS devices unavailable.

HOU-1198-72017  ZIS2    If a device had the QUEUEING field set to NOT
                ZIS1    ALLOWED and queuing was selected, the device
                        would be selected with just the IO("Q") flag
                        cleared.  This patch will cause the user to be
                        reasked the device question.

                        one that picks it up, then the task is placed
                        in the "C" list and is lost. This is fixed
                        by having the sub-manager look in the "C" list
                        as part of its checking for work to do.

========================================================================= 
Installation:

  1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
      so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
      
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
      
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
      On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
      
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
         
 4.   Inhibit users from login into the system. (If you install when few
      users are on the system and the possibility of some CLOBER errors is
      acceptable, then users can stay on the system.) The risk is users or
      tasks that are in the Device Handler at install time.  
      Also place TASKMAN in a wait state.
      
  5.  D ^XPDKRN
         Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*104'
                              ==========

  8.  After installing this patch,
      OpenM Sites - you don't need to move anything, skip this step. 
      DSM/MSM sites - you need to move several routines from 
      your production account to each manager account:
      
      ZIS1
      ZIS2
      ZIS3
      ZISFMSM
      ZISFVXD
      ZISHMSM
      ZISHONT
      ZISHVXD
      ZOSFONT
      ZTMS1
      
  9.  And in the manager account,  (OpenM sites remain in VAH)
      All sites:
      DO RELOAD^ZTMGRSET
      Select the System
      Patch number to load: 104
                            ===
       
 10.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
 11.  Enable user's login.
      Remove TASKMAN from the wait state.

HIN-1298-40427  XUSRB    A convoluted link with patch XU*8*69 is causing
                         problems in CPRS at DSM sites.  The error is
                         %DSM-E-DEVNOTOPN at QUIT^%ZIS6 with IO(0) null.
                         This only happens at DSM sites that do not have
                         auto sign-on disabled.  The code that calls the
                         client agent mades a call to HOME^%ZIS and TCP
                         connection don't work as a home device.  The fix 
                         is to have the XUSRB save the NULL device as the 
                         HOME device before the call to Client agent.

NOIS              RTN   Description
LIT-1298-71717   XUS1   The code that logs users into the sign-on log
                        is very old and if the current date/time was in
                        use, it would add 1 second to the time.  With the
                        large number of users and tasks that are logged
                        these days it often would increment past 60 seconds
                        and sometimes past 60 minutes.  The fix was to 
                        increment by 100th of a second.
                        
DAY-1098-42371 XUTMOPT  "One time queueing" would allow queueing to devices
                        that cannot be queued to.  Checks were added to 
                        prevent this.
                        
BOS-0199-10157 XQALFWD  When forwarding an alert, and no comment was entered
                        the alert was not forwarded and the user did not 
                        know the alert wasn't sent.
                        
IND-1298-71717 XPARDD   When making a call to EN^XPAR and the data is 
                        as a set of codes, sometimes it would talk.  This
                        unwanted behavior has been fixed. 
                        
                XUSTAT  We found that XUSTAT had a reference to file 3.
                        This has been changed to file 200.
                        
MIN-0199-40756          The Institution file still has some subfiles 
                        49.01 and 49.02 that still point to file 3.  
                        These had been marked for deletion and now are 
                        deleted.
                        
ALX-0199-71347          An error was occurring when a new entry was added
                        to the Institution file because of the AD x-ref.
                        The fix was to new the variable DS in the x-ref
                        code.

Sites should use CHECK^XTSUMBLD to verify checksums
========================================================================= 
Installation:

  1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines maybe mapped,
      so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines. 
     
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
     
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
      On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
      
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
     
  4.  Users can remain on the system. This patch can be loaded any
      non-peak time.
      This patch can be queued for install at non-peak hours.


     
  5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      option:
        Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*111'
                             ==========
                             
        No Options or Protocols need to be placed out-of-order.
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO
                                                                        ==

This patch is being released by Capacity Management (CM) in anticipation
of a future patch for the Statistical Analysis of Global Growth (SAGG)
Version 1.8 software package.  A future SAGG patch will enable the
collection of disk capacity information from the sites.
 
This patch distrbution will be adding a new %ZOSVK* routine to the
system-specific manager routine set.  The accompanying installation
instructions will guide you in adding these routines to your system.
 
This distribution also contains the ZTMGRSET routine which will save the
new routine under the correct name.

This patch adds two new fields and removes several fields marked for
removal.

NEW FIELDS
This Patch adds a new field with data to the PACKAGE file: ADDITIONAL
PREFIXS. This was requested by the DBA so that packages could check patches
in KIDS when the patch was in alternate prefix namespace. 
 
This patch adds a new field: MAIL GROUP, that KIDS will use with patch
XU*8*108 to send a local install message.  
&gt;&gt;You may want to add local MAIL GROUPS that should be notified when a 
  package is installed.&lt;&lt;

FIELD REMOVAL  the following fields are removed.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;114 SEQ #106</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1999-06-26 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch fixes several problems associated with alerts and provides
numerous requested enhancements.
 
NOIS
 
HUN-0997-20420   MAC-1198-60864
 
The ability to forward an alert has been limited to the point of
selection and prior to processing an alert.  A number of users have
requested the ability to view and/or process an alert and then be able to
forward (as reflected in the above NOIS entries) or set the alert as new
again for subsequent processing. The current patch adds the ability to
forward or re-new the alert at the point where previously the user was
asked about continuing alert processing.
Routines affected:   XQALERT1, XQALFWD
 
 
WBP-0198-22413
 
While CPRS has supported a capability to send alerts directly to a
designated surrogate, this has left other packages without such an
ability.  This NOIS and CPRS developers have requested a more generic
surrogate capability supported directly by the alerts within Kernel.  The
current patch adds the ability for an individual using a new 'S' option
within the alerts to designate and/or remove a surrogate for their
alerts.  The user may, if desired, specify a start date/time and/or an
end date/time for the surrogate to be effective.  If an end date/time is
specified, the surrogate will be removed automatically effective with the
first alert sent to the user after the end date/time has passed.  If a
start date/time is not specified, the surrogate becomes active
immediately.  If an end date/time is not specified, the surrogate is
active until the user removes the surrogate.  A message is sent to the
surrogate to indicate that he has been designated as a surrogate, and a
message is sent when the surrogate is removed.  If the user has no alerts
and selects the alert option, he will be asked if he wants to add or
remove a surrogate.  A new option (XQALERT SURROGATE SET/REMOVE) is also
provided which may be used by IRM or ADPAC staff to add or remove a
surrogate for a selected user.  This option has been added to the Alert
Manager option.
Routines affected: XQALERT1, XQALSET, XQALSURO (a new routine)
 
 
ISL-0299-50356
 
A problem was identified such that if an alert was deleted for a given
user, and then the same alert was specified to be deleted for the same
user, it resulted in the alert being deleted for the next user with a
higher internal entry number and the alert was still active.  This patch
corrects this problem.
Routines affected: XQALDEL
 
 
Functionality requested by CPRS developers
 
The ability for a user to delete specific alerts without viewing and/or
processing them has been requested many times.  In this patch, this
functionality is included by providing the new 'D' option within the
alerts. This option provides the ability to delete "information only"
alerts. Alerts which require processing can not currently be deleted.  In
the future, however, if alerts requiring processing are created with the
new variable XQACNDEL set to 1 they too would be able to be deleted
(i.e., the developer of the code which creates the alert can specify if
it must be processed or can be deleted). Any alerts which were selected
for deletion, but could not be deleted will be noted for the user.  The
ability for the user to delete alerts other than information only will
require that the developers within a package decide that specific alerts,
which would normally invoke processing via an option or routine, may be
deleted specifically by the user without processing. They would then set
the variable XQACNDEL to a value of 1 (one) prior to calling SET^XQALERT
to set up the alert.  Deletion of an alert by the user (or by IRM or
ADPAC staff using the existing option) is noted within the ALERT TRACKING
file as deletion by a user (with the user ID) without processing of the
alert.
Routines affected: XQALERT1, XQALDEL
 
 
There have been several requests for the display of pending alerts to
return to the current screen after an alert has been processed.  This
capability is included within the current patch.
Routines affected: XQALERT1
 
 
The following entry points are added within this patch and are entered as
supported references.
 
AHISTORY^XQALBUTL(XQAID,ROOT) - Provides information from the ALERT
TRACKING file for the alert indicated by the alert ID (XQAID).  The
information is returned descendent from the closed root specified by ROOT
in the form that it is present in the ALERT TRACKING file.
 
 
$$PENDING^XQALBUTL(XQAUSER,XQAID) - Returns 1 (one) if the alert
indicated by the alert ID (XQAID) is currently pending for the user with
internal entry number specified by XQAUSER.  Otherwise a value of 0
(zero) is returned.
 
 
$$PKGPEND(XQAUSER,XQAPKG) - Returns 1 if the user indicated by XQAUSER
has any pending alerts with the first ';'-piece of XQAID equal to the
package identifier indicated by XQAPKG.
 
 
SETSURO^XQALSURO(XQAUSER,XQALSURO,XQALSTRT,XQALEND) - Establishes for the
user with internal entry number XQAUSER a surrogate with the internal
entry number XQALSURO.  XQALSTRT is an optional start date/time in
internal VA Filemanager format, and XQALEND is an optional end date/time
in internal VA Filemanager format.
 
 
REMVSURO^XQALSURO(XQAUSER) - Removes the current surrogate (if any) for
the user with the internal entry number XQAUSER.
 
 
$$CURRSURO^XQALSURO(XQAUSER) - For the user with internal entry number
XQAUSER returns the internal entry number of the current surrogate or -1
if there is no surrogate specified.
 
 
ALERTDAT^XQALBUTL(XQAID,ROOT) - Returns information from ALERT TRACKING
file for alert with XQAID.  The data is returned descendent from the
closed root passed in ROOT.  If ROOT is not specified, the data is
returned in the array XQALERTD.  The array is subscripted by the field
number, the value is returned as the internal value (including NULL
values) and, if the internal and external values differ, followed by the
external value separated by '^'.  If the field names are desired, they
are also included as a second subscript to the array (with a null value).
If the alert is not present, the array root is returned with a NULL
value.
 
 
USERLIST^XQALBUTL(XQAID,ROOT) - Returns recipients of alert with ID of
XQAID from ALERT TRACKING file in an array descendent from the closed
array specified in ROOT.  If ROOT is not specified, then the data is
returned in XQALUSRS.  The data is returned subscripted by an integer,
and the value contains the internal entry number for the user in File 200
and the external value for the user's name (the .01 field in file 200)
separated by '^'.  If the specified alert is not present, the array root
is returned with a NULL value.
 
 
USERDATA^XQALBUTL(XQAID,XQAUSER,ROOT) - returns information from the
ALERT TRACKING file related to the alert with an ID of XQAID for the user
specified by the internal entry number in XQAUSER.  The data is returned
descendent from the closed root passed in ROOT.  If ROOT is not
specified, the data is returned in the array XQALUSER.  The array is
subscripted by the field number, the value is returned as the internal
value (including NULL values) and, if the internal and external values
differ, followed by the external value separated by '^'.  If the field
names are desired they are also included as a second subscript to the
array (with a NULL value). If the alert is not present, the array root
is returned with a NULL value.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
     This patch fixes a couple of problems with menu templates: 1. The
selection of a numbered choice outside of the range of the actual list
could cause an &lt;UNDEF&gt; (DAY-0497-42420 and BYN-0297-10733); 2. Failure to
reenter the primary tree when backing up from a secondary tree
(DAY-1295-41818); and, the inability to skip an option in a template by
hitting a RETURN (FNC-1297-30868); and 3.Prevents the selection of a
broker-type option when creating a menu template.
 
     **PLEASE NOTE**  THE SOFTWARE NOW DISPLAYS THE TEXT OF EACH OPTION IT
PROCESSES AS IT DOES SO.  YOUR USERS WILL, THEREFORE, NOTICE A CHANGE IN
BEHAVIOR AS MENU TEMPLATES RUN.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch fixes one NOIS, one E3R, and several requested fixes for CPRS.

ISL-0299-51863         Increase the size of the "load file" string.

E3R # 12059            Send Mail Message to local group.
                       The mail group is defined in the Package file and is
                       new with patch XU*8*117.

CPRS                 - Allow utilities to work on all components included
                       in a master build.
                     - Allow run routines for master builds.                
                     - Allow install to "inhibit login" for the install
                       duration.
                     - Fix an erroneous message when exporting data without 
                       the DD.
                     - Delete one-time run routines after install.
                       Development sites can override this by setting
                       the KERNEL PARAMETERS file with "XPD NO_EPP_DELETE"
                       with a value of 1.
                     - Update the "Date Distributed" field in the build
                       and transport to the install and include in tracking
                       message.  This will help track test versions installed.

  This patch has updates to allow Cache sites to run taskman on two or more
  nodes at the same time.  How locking was being used with the IO queue was
  changed to use ^%ZTSCH("DEV",io) in its place. This should allow more than
  one sub-manager to look at the "IO" list at the same time.  If there is a
  delay in one device it will not delay other devices.  The submanagers now
  keep a list of available submanagers as well as there count. The option
  "XUTM QCLEAN" will reset the count as part of its work.  Each lock timeout
  was checked for constancy.  Changes to make the STARTUP flag in the
  OPTION SCHEDULE file work better.

Sites should use CHECK^XTSUMBLD to verify checksums.

Be sure to follow step 11 below.

========================================================================= 
Installation:

Users can remain on the system

  1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
      so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
      
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
      
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
      On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
      
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
         
 4.  Users can remain on the system. 
      Stop TASKMAN, and have submanagers stop.
      
      
  5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      option:
         Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*118'
                              =========
                              
        No Options or Protocols need to be placed out-of-order.
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO
                                                                        ==
      
  8.  After installing this patch,
      OpenM Sites - you don't need to move anything, skip this step. 
      DSM/MSM sites - you need to move several routines from 
      your production account to each manager account:
      
ZIS2
ZIS6
ZISTCP
ZISTCPS
ZISUTL
ZOSVMSM
ZOSVONT
ZOSVVXD
ZTLOAD
ZTLOAD1
ZTLOAD2
ZTER
ZTM
ZTM0
ZTM1
ZTM2
ZTM4
ZTM5
ZTM6
ZTMKU
ZTMON
ZTMON1
ZTMS
ZTMS0
ZTMS1
ZTMS2
ZTMS3
ZTMS7
      
  9.  And in the manager account,  (OpenM sites remain in VAH)
      All sites:
      DO RELOAD^ZTMGRSET
      Select the System
      Patch number to load: 118
                            ===
       
 10.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
 
 11.  In the production account, You will need to edit file 14.7
      first DO ^ZTMCHK and from the second screen look for
      "Cpu-volume Pair:  ROU:APP1".
      Edit file 14.7 and change the name from ROU to ROU:APP1
      then add a new entry ROU:APP3.  The ROU is the volume set name you
      gave the system and the APP1 should be your Cache configuration 
      name.  The Avanti team will provide more info on setting up for
      running dual taskman nodes.
      
 12.  Restart TASKMAN with D RESTART^ZTMB.  DSM sites this may require
      a privileged user.

                        If the 5th parameter is missing or 0 then it will
                        work as before, a 1 will prevent ZTSK from being newed.

=============================================================================
  This patch can be installed with users on the system, but no other users
  should be using KIDS while you install this patch.
===========================================================================
 INSTALLATION:
 
   1.  These routines are usually mapped on systems that allow mapping,
       so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
 
   2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS Distribution onto your system.
 
   3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your 
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the patch in the 
       Transport global.
 
   4.  Users can remain on the system. This patch can be queued and 
       installed at any time.  TaskMan can remain running.
 
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
          2  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          3  Print Transport Global
          4  Compare Transport Global to Current System
          5  Backup a Transport Global
 
   6.  As with the installation of all Kernel patches, it is recommended
       that you return to programmers prompt and use D ^XPDKRN:
         Install Package(s)
          INSTALL NAME: XU*8.0*131
                        =========
 
   7.  AXP Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.

Y2K Waiver Request ID#:Y2KW0001   Y2K Waiver Status: Approved
this patch may be installed during the Y2K Moratorium, AFTER 
1/15/2000.  
 
1.  E3R - 12385.
    In support of MailMan patch XM*7.1*107, this patch adds a new whole
    file cross reference ("AH", on the DIVISION field) to the NEW PERSON
    file, to enable limited broadcast messager by division.
 
2.  Whenever a name is changed or added in the NEW PERSON file, it is
    necessary to transmit the new name to the Accu-Max system via HL7
    Messaging.  Routines will routinely check for the existence of
    ^DGRU(46.11,"AC") node.  For those entries which exist, a Master
    File Update("MFU") HL7 Message will be created and sent to the
    Accu-Max system if they have a "Physician" class.  Several new
    cross-references are being added to the Name and Provider Class
    fields of file #200.  These new cross-references will trigger the
    data into the RAI/MDS Monitor file(#46.11).
 
3.  MON-0899-52735.
    When using the Deactivate a User option [XUSERDEACT], a prompt
    will display to "Delete All Mail Access:".  When cursor is set
    to the field to respond the system shows that the user has 0
    messages in their mail box or group though their are messages.
    Routine XUSTERM and XUSRB1 has been revised to correct this
    problem.
 
4.  ISL-1199-51331.
    To allow CPRS Notification users the ability to identify users
    and/or OE/RR teams, the DEVICE file #3.5, will be added to the
    PARAMETER ENTITY file #8989.518.  A new routine(^XUYDEV) has
    been created to allow entry of the DEVICE into file #8989.518.
    When patch has completed loading, proceed with the following
    steps:
 
    1.  From Programmer Mode, execute the following routine:
 
        &gt;D ^XUYDEV

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
While investigating NOIS DAY-0200-40034 a leap year problem was found in
SCH^XLFDT. This would affect tasks scheduled for the last day of the month.
Taskman uses this routine to evaluate the RESCHEDULING FREQUENCY field in 
the Option Scheduling file.

Also fixed is a looping problem if the schedule requests a day beyond the
end of the month. Like 30th of each month for February or 31st for April.
Now it will default to the LAST DAY of the month.  This would make a schedule
of "1M(30@2200)" for February be eveluated as "1M(L@2200)".

Sites should use the following to see if any tasks are affected by evaluating
the QUEUED TO RUN AT WHAT TIME field to see if it appropriate for the task.
Look for task that should have been scheduled for Feb 29,2000.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This Patch installs a routine that can do a DNS lookup to convert a 
domain name to an IP address. This routine has two supported API's.
The change by VISN's to the 10. private IP addressing pushed the need
for this patch. 

***************IMPORTANT*********************************************
This patch is used by HL7 patch HL*1.6*63.
The POST install will enter the address of one of the national 
DNS servers.  PLEASE CHANGE TO THE CORRECT ONE FOR YOUR SITE.
IF YOU ARE INSTALLING THIS PATCH IN A TEST ENVIRONMENT ALONG WITH HL7
PATCH 63, DO NOT POINT TO A PRODUCTION DNS! THIS COULD RESULT IN
TRANSMITTING TEST HL7 MESSAGES TO A SITE'S PRODUCTION SYSTEM.
The install will test for a HL7 test parameter and not install the
default DNS address in this case.  PLEASE CHECK.
********************************************************************** 

See DBIA# 3056 for documentation on the API's.

There is a entry point for testing: TEST^XLFNSLK

Routine Summary
The following routines are included in this patch.  The second line of each

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;136 SEQ #132</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2000-05-02 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses some of the problems that taskman is having with
the ORB NOTIFICATION RESOURCE and the ORW THREAD RESOURCE.
Working with West LA and Seattle, a locking conflict was identified
when Taskman was trying to allocate resource devices.
With this change taskman skips the lock of ^%ZTSCH("DEV",IO) to prevent
two tasks from trying to open the same device at the same time.  The 
resource device has its own lock to control this.
This should fix a number of NOIS reports.
NJH-0100-20258, NTH-0100-70436, CLE-0100-40398, CTX-0100-70947,
CLE-0200-40051, BAY-0100-31168, TAM-0100-32225, JAC-0100-72572,
JAC-0200-70074, CTX-0300-70786

Three new fields were added to the TASKMAN SITE PARAMETERS file.
"Balance Interval" to control how offen the manager does the Balance code.
"Auto Delete Tasks" to control if the sub-manager will set ZTREQ to "@"
 before the task starts.
"Manager Startup Delay" to control how long the manager waits when starting.
 This field isn't used for a RESTART.

TAM-0100-32225
A problem in the use of ZTREQ to re-schedule a task was fixed with a
change to %ZTLOAD3.  

MAC-0300-61865
If there was an error in the loadbalance routine the variable ZTOVERLD would
be undefined, ZTM6.

Also fix is a incorrect label in the ShareLic code of ZOSVONT.
LIT-0300-71933, FGH-0300-32520
 Routine %LICENSE not in DMS 7.2 as expected. ZOSVVXD.
 The need for %ZOSV1 eleminated,  Routine ZOSV1VXD deleted by install.
 ZTMGRSET updated to reflect this change.

CML-1299-4077 XUTMQ3 
Changed to adapt to the new Taskman "IO" list.

ALB-1299-50759 %ZIS2 
Problem with the HFS parameters in the device file not being used when
called from Taskman and ZTIO was used to setup the device.
                     
ZIS6 was changed to consolidate the resource device checking.

      so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
      
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
      
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
      On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
      
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
         
 4.  Users can remain on the system. This patch can be loaded any

  8.  After installing this patch,
      Cache Sites - you don't need to move anything, skip this step. 
      DSM/MSM sites - you need to move several routines from 
      your production account to each manager account:
      
ZIS2
ZIS6
ZOSVONT
ZOSVVXD
ZTLOAD3
ZTM
ZTM0
ZTM5
ZTM6
ZTMGRSET
ZTMON
ZTMS
ZTMS1
ZTMS3
ZTMS4
ZTMS7

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This is the replacement patch for XU*8*138.  If patch XU*8*138 has been loaded
this patch should fix the changes that XU*8*138 made to the cross references
of file 200.

This Kernel patch allows users to be validated through the
traditional Access and Verify Codes on their home systems and then carry
that authentication to other systems where they may not be entered in the
New Person File (NPF).  A packet of information is carried with the user
to the system being visited, and that information is then entered in the
NPF so that a trace to the original authentication can be made.  No Access
and Verify codes are, however, entered in the NPF so that the visitor may
not log in.  He or she will only see that information provided by the CPRS
foreign views software.  A bulletin, XUVISIT, will be sent when an entry
is made in the New person File if the site has assigned a valid mail group
to the bulletin.  The software defines a new multiple in the NPF called
"VISITED FROM" which stores the information brought from the home system.
There is a new SORT and PRINT template to show NPF entries that have been
VISITORS to a site.  XUS VISIT USER.

The Sign-on log has new fields to record the remote site and remote ien of a
visitor.  A new Print template XUSEC REMOTE ACCESS and sort template 
XUSEC REMOTE ACCESS to print just entries from remote users.

In working with the RAI/MDS folks a problem was found in how the FMTHL7
and HL7TFM API's of XLFDT worked.  This has been fixed.
FM stores midnight as 3000803.24 and HL7 standard requires it to be sent
as 200008040000-0800  i.e. Midnight of the night extending from Aug 3 to
Aug 4, 2000. 

Also a new routine XLFCRC to compute CRC's, both 16 and 32 bit.
See DBIA 3156 for details.

IVM-0400-31566
An option queued in the option scheduling file that didn't have a 
rescheduling frequency would not have the ZTQPARAM variable or other 
parameters available. This was because the entry was deleted from the 
option schedule file before the variables were set-up.  The fix was to set-
up the variables first.

It has been found in testing at Bay Pines that if the call to the DNS times 
out the XLFNSLK routine fails to close the device used to call the DNS. 
This causes the calling routine to get an error.  Fix to see that on a time-
out the device is closed.

*** Note there are routines that need to moved as part of this patch.
 
 BRX-0999-10965  The error trap doesn't record any data for stack overflow
                 of allocation errors.  Before on a allocation error
                 we would call the M vendors error trap.  The current 
                 vendors error trap tries to set variables and also gets
                 an error.  The fix to this problem was to do a exclusive
                 kill to get some room and then record the error.
                 For stack overflow error we pop the stack back 8
                 levels so we have some room for our DO's.
                 
BAY-0600-31579   When adding a HUNT GROUP device to the IO queue the
MIN-0600-41387   device type wasn't added at the top level.  This would

ISL-1199-51207   When trying to restore the variables on a Cache system
                 XTER2 would get an error.  The special Cache data item
                 from $ZU(56) is stored.  This was fixed by changing the
                 name from OpenM_ZU to $ZU(... then %ZTER saves it because 
                 XTER2 already knows not to restore anything that starts 
                 with a "$".

                 picked up correctly.  Fixed to get the right data. ZTM5
                 
Request from the Mailman developer to save off data in ZTLOAD so user can
queue reports to p-message.  Change to ZTLOAD1.

When placed in production the change in HL7 to call the XLFDT routine for 
HL7 to FileMan date conversion exposed an existing bug in the HL7TFM code.
This patch corrects that problem.

  1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
      so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines. 
     
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
     
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
      On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
      
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global
         Print Transport Global

NT sites need to install patch XU*8*162 and XU*8*170 TOGETHER
Make sure you have Patch XU*8.0*162 and XU*8.0*170 before going any
further. XU*8*162 is required for this patch but there is a problem with
routine ZUONT which has big impact on NT sites. After installing patch
XU*8*162, no users are allowed on the system.
To avoid the problem:
Inhibit log on and install patch XU*8.0*162 per instructions make sure you
have a session logged in at programmer mode and immediately install patch
170 per instructions in this patch. Allow users back in the system.
 
CMH-0800-N3105
Patch XU*8*162 made a call to $$AVJ^%ZOSF in place of $$AVJ^%ZOSV in ZUONT.
This caused a NOLINE error.  Fixed to make the correct call. This affects 
Cache sites only.

Patch XU*8*151 did fix the use of the ZTQPARAM variable or other 
parameters available if the scheduled option didn't have a re-queue frequence 
but if the option was on a schedule it broke the re-schedule.  
This patch fixes the re-scheduling.  As part of the post INIT it will go
thru the Scheduled options (file 19.2) an reschedule any that have a past 
date to run.

ISW-1299-21488, ISW-1299-22382

This patch also adds a new field to the new person file under the Division
field.  This new field is Default and is used by the GUI log-on to select
one division to pre-select.  This is only needed for users that have more 
than one division.

This patch updates the EDIT AN EXISTING USER form.  This form was also
changed by patch XU*8*134 (Name Standardization)

This patch also provides support for the Broker User Info properties.

MIW-0500-42196 XUS1   Patch XU*8*165 broke the auto sign-in (single sign-in).
                      The routine was already in this patch so the fix was

Patch XU*8*165 unintentionly send all fields in file 200 not just the
ones needed for the patch.  This patch fixes the problem caused in
the DEA# and VA# fields.  The main problem was a change made to the
cross-reference of each field.  The post-INIT will reindex the data
to setup the cross-reference.  Some experamental fields from the
development account were send and will be removed.  Routine XUINPCH3
is just the Post-INIT routine.  The discription was changed on other
fields.
The fields being loaded:
53.1,53.2,53.3,53.4,53.6,53.7,53.8,54.1


 
NAME STANDARDIZATION: SPACES WITHIN SUFFIXES
NOIS
====
ANN-0800-42960
MAN-0800-12845
 
Background
==========
The Name Standardization Patch (Kernel Patch XU*8.0*134), which was
released on April 6, 2000, includes a data conversion run as part of the
Post-Installation of that patch. The data conversion converts all names
stored in the .01 field of the New Person file to standard form. It also
parses each name into its component parts (Given Name, Middle Name, Family
Name, and Suffix), and stores those component parts in the Name Components
file (#20) also released with the patch.
 
 
Problem
=======
The data conversion looks for specific suffixes at the end of the name,
such as MD, PHD, and DDS. However, it was not accounting for suffixes that
contain periods, such as M.D., Ph.D. and D.D.S. When the data conversion
finds a name with a suffix that contains periods the name could be
incorrectly parsed.
 
For example, suppose the name as stored in the .01 field of the New Person
file before patch XU*8.0*134 was installed was:
 
            Original name: SMITH,JOHN M.D.
 
The result after the data conversion would be:
 
    New standardized name: SMITH,JOHN M D
 
    Name components as stored in the Name Components file:
                    Given: JOHN M.
                   Middle: D.
                   Family: SMITH
                   Suffix:
 
Note that in the above, the suffix M.D. was not recognized as a suffix.
'M' was considered part of the person's first (given) name, and 'D' was
considered the middle initial.
 
 
Solution
========
In order to correct names that were parsed incorrectly by the data
conversion, routine XLFNP176 is included in this patch. The FIX^XLFNP176
entry point loops through the entries in the New Person file and looks for
names that may have been standardized and parsed incorrectly. It will then
optionally correct the name in the New Person file and the corresponding
name components in the Name Components file.
 
NOTE: Sites should still install patch XU*8*134. The FIX^XLFNP176 entry
point is designed to run on systems on which the data conversion has
already been run.
 
 
FIX^XLFNP176 Description
========================
This directly mode utility loops through all entries in the New Person
file (#200) and looks in the .01 field for names that end in any of the
following strings (without the single quotes (')):
 
  ' M D'
  ' D D S'
  ' PH D'
  ' R N'
  ' D P M'
  ' D O'
  ' P A'
  ' N P'
  ' C R N A'
  ' L P N'
 
If it finds any of the above strings at the end of the name, it assumes
that string is a suffix. It removes the spaces from the suffix and stores
the modified name in the .01 field of the New Person file. It also stores
the suffix (without embedded spaces) in the Suffix field (#5) of the
corresponding entry in the Name Components file.
 
For example, if FIX^XLFNP176 finds a name in the .01 field of the New
Person file stored as:
 
        Name: SMITH,JOHN M D
 
it assumes M D is a suffix, and changes the name to SMITH,JOHN MD. It also
stores MD in the SUFFIX field (#5) in the Name Components file.
 
 
How to use:
----------
FIX^XLFNP176 can be run with VISTA users online. However, it is
recommended that it be run during non-peak times.
 
Run FIX^XLFNP176 from programmer mode:
 
        &gt;D FIX^XLFNP176
 
The routine need only be run onced to fix the problem.
 
 
Customizing the list of problem suffixes checked by FIX^XLFNP176
----------------------------------------------------------------
If you wish to modify the list of problem suffixes checked by XLFNP176,
you can edit the text at line tag LINE^XLFNP176. Replace the list with an
up-arrow (^)-delimited list of suffixes that may occur at the end of the
Names stored in your New Person file.

BRX-0900-12121
With changes to the security checks that Mailman makes before allowing
a message to be sent, any tasks that Taskman start as part of the system
startup need to have the DUZ set to a valid user.  After talking with the
DBA it was decided to have Taskman use POSTMASTER as the user (DUZ=.5).
This change will only affect tasks started when Taskman first starts,
that have the special queueing field set to STARTUP or Startup Persistent.
ZTM0 is the routine that has been changed for this patch.

To support P-MESSAGE a change was made to ZTMS3 to move the clean-up
of temp globals to after the device has been closed.

ATG-0700-31453
In working with NVS it has been found that at times the persistent
task restart code is too good and schedules many copies of the same task
before one starts and signals that it is running.  The other copies
get caught waiting for a lock on the global node ^%ZTSCH("TASK",&lt;task&gt;).
This has been fixed by using a timeout on earlier lock before the
task is setup.  This change was made in ZTMS2.

XUTMOPT is included to provide an API for applications to check on
scheduled tasks.

Sites should use CHECK^XTSUMBLD to verify checksums.

========================================================================= 
Installation:

&gt;&gt;&gt;Users may remain on the system.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Taskman does need to be stopped.

  1.  DSM sites - This routines maybe mapped,
      so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
      
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
      
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
      On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
      
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
         
 4.  Users can remain on the system.
     Also place TASKMAN in a wait state.
      Use option: Place Taskman in a WAIT State
      
  5.  In Programmer mode:
      Use "D ^XPDKRN" then
         Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*175'
                              =========
                              
        No Options or Protocols need to be placed out-of-order.
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO
                                                                        ==
      
  8.  After installing this patch,
      Cache Sites - you don't need to move anything, skip this step. 
      DSM/MSM sites - you need to one several routine from 
      your production account to each manager account:
      
ZTM0
ZTMS2
ZTMS3
      
  9.  And in the manager account,  (OpenM sites remain in VAH)
      All sites:
      DO RELOAD^ZTMGRSET
      Select the System
      Patch number to load: 175
                            ===
       
 10.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
 
 11.   Remove TASKMAN from the wait state. (DO RUN^ZTMKU)

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch adds the DELSTAT API to the alert functionality to provide
information on whether an alert has been deleted for various users.  The
API was requested for CPRS functionality.
 
DELSTAT - For the most recent alert with XQAIDVAL as the PackageID
passed in, on return array VALUES contains the DUZ for users in 
VALUES along with an indicator of whether the alert has been 
deleted or not, e.g., DUZ^0 if not deleted or DUZ^1 if deleted.  
Note that contents of VALUES will be killed prior to building the 
list.
 
Example:   D DELSTAT^XQALBUTL("OR;14765;23",.RESULTS)
 
Returned:   The value of RESULTS indicates the number of entries in
              the array.  The entries are then ordered in numerical 
              order in the RESULTS array.
                  RESULTS = 3
                  RESULTS(1) = "146^0"   User 146 - not deleted
                  RESULTS(2) = "297^1"   User 297 - deleted
                  RESULTS(3) = "673^0"   User 673 - not deleted

As a part of its security the RPC Broker requires that a Remote Procedure
Call (RPC) be included within a Broker (Client/Server) or Context option,
and that this option be included within the user's menu tree.  This has
resulted in some context options including hundreds of RPCs.  This patch
modifies XQCS to look also at the ITEMS subfile (which has been used for
menu items) within a context option, and if these point to other context
options, the RPCs included in that context will be included as a part of
the original context.
 
In addition, this patch modifies the Screenman option for Editing Options
to add the ability to add context options within the ITEMS subfile.
 
This modification was requested and tested by the developers working on a 
Patient Lookup object and Smart Card applications.

converting a HL7 date like 200101091230 would return a value like 3010109.1230 
this causes a problem in sorting. There will be a follow-up patch to finish the

NOIS: DAY-1000-42520   Vista Security (Verify Code) 
These changes are required to meet VHA DIRECTIVE 6210 
Available at http://vaww.domain.ext/publ/direc/health/direct/vha6210d.pdf
The rules listed below are from the Document "VA Account and Password 
Management Interim Policy" 
 
 a.     Controls shall be implemented to require strong passwords.  
        Passwords shall be at least eight characters in length, and 
        contain three of the following four kinds of characters: 
        letters  (upper case and lower), numbers, and, characters 
        that are neither letters nor numbers (like "#", "@" or "$"). 
        
 b.     Passwords shall be changed no less frequently than every 90 days.  
        Information systems shall not permit re-assignment of the last 
        three passwords used.  
        
 c.     Accounts that have been inactive for 90 days shall be disabled.  
 
 d.     To preclude password guessing, an intruder lock out feature 
        shall suspend accounts after five invalid attempts to log on.  
        Where round-the-clock system administration service is available, 
        system administrator intervention shall be required to clear a 
        locked account.  Where round-the-clock system administration 
        service is not available, accounts shall remained locked out 
        for at least ten minutes.  
 
Here is what was done based on the requirement from VHA POLICY:
Item a. Because VistA has been case-insensitive for many years, we chose
        to retain this characteristic. This means that VistA only has three 
        sets of characters to build a password from: alpha, numeric and 
        punctuation. The change from the past requirements is the new 
        requirement for punctuation characters and an increase in length 
        from 6 to 8 characters.
        
        The Kernel XUS2 routine was changed to require that 
        verify codes be composed of the following three groups of 
        characters: alpha, numeric, and punctuation.
        
Item b. This rule was implemented by changing the valid range in the data 
        dictionary and then checking the value in the KERNEL SYSTEM 
        PARAMETERS file (#8989.3) and resetting the value if it is found 
        to be greater than 90. Kernel has long kept old verify codes based 
        on the date they were changed. A change has been made to limit the 
        time frame for removal in option "Purge Log of Old Access and Verify 
        Codes" [XUSERAOLD].
 
Item c. This rule was implemented by making changes to the scheduled Kernel 
        option 'Automatic Deactivation of Users' [XUAUTODEACTIVEATE] routine 
        XUSTERM1. This option has been changed to check each user's last 
        sign-on date and if it is more than 90 days old, sets the DISUSER 
        field for that user.  If this happens the user will get a "No Access 
        Allowed for this User."  message when they trying to logon.
        
        Note: The DISUSER field is shown on the 'User Inquiry' and is on the 
        second page of the Kernel option "Edit an Existing User" [XUSEREDIT].  
 
Item d. Kernel has always implemented a form of 'lockout'. Changes where made 
        to the Kernel System parameters file DEFAULT # OF ATTEMPTS and DEFAULT 
        LOCK-OUT TIME field's. The values in the KSP were checked and changed 
        to meet the new limits for these fields.
        
 
        Note: In addition, the sign-on code was changed to echo 
              an asterisk (*) for each character entered. This 
              follows the Microsoft Windows login style, which is 
              a change from the VMS login style.

Description
===========
 
        With the advent of the Cache 3.2 Operating system the underlying
character set of ASCII has been changed to Latin I, an ISO standard that
the VA supports.  This change caused, however, an ancient piece of code to
break that has been promulgated throughout the Menu System over the years
which was used to change strings of code to all uppercase.  White City
experienced an endless loop when control characters were somehow
entered into the prompt looking for an option name.  This patch changes
those errant lines of code to standard, Kernel calls to UP^%XLFSTR().

Site was getting a null subscript error when a site that did not have a
station number in the institution file (#4) made a RDV request to the site.
This was fixed by checking for the station number when the request is made
to prevent sending a invalid request.  At the remote site a second set of
check are made to see that all the needed parameters are in place before
starting to log the visit.

In the code for REQ^%ZTLOAD the new schedule time is put in the wrong
piece of the TASK. The code which puts the time in the task record was
not found at REQ^%ZTLOAD. The code at REQ^%ZTLOAD transfers control to
%ZTLOAD3 which then contains the code being fixed. The 5th piece of
^%ZTSK(ztsk,0) was set when piece 6 should have been set.  
Also the original create $H is moved to a new field (#16) and the $H
at the time of requeueing is set into the 5th piece.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;197 SEQ #173</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2001-08-02 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch is being released by Capacity Management (CM) for installation
of modifications to the ^%ZOSVK* collection routines that are used by the
Statistical Analysis of Global Growth (SAGG) Version 1.8 software package.
 
All DSM and OpenM-NT (Cache) sites are instructed to install this patch.
 
This patch makes modifications to the ^%ZOSVK* collection routines that
are used by the SAGG software package.
 
This patch removes the MSM versions of the collection routines (ZOSVKSME
and ZOSVKSMS) from the production environment.
 
Provided that the 'SAGG Master Background Task' [KMPS SAGG REPORT] is not
currently running, this installation can be performed at any time of the
day with minimal disruption to users.  Installation should not take longer
than 10-15 minutes.
 
Installation:
============
 
  1.   You will need to disable any routines within the %ZOSVK* namespace.
       
  2.   Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
       
  3.   The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
       
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
       
   4.  You do not need to inhibit users from login into the system.
       
   5.  Ensure that the 'SAGG Master Background Task' [KMPS SAGG REPORT] is
       not currently running by using the 'Status of SAGG Collection
       Routines' [KMPS SAGG STATUS] option and verifying the following
       message is displayed:
       
       The temporary collection global (i.e., ^XTMP("KMPS")) has no data.
       
   6.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 'Install
       Package(s)' option and select the package 
 
          XU*8.0*197
          ==========         
       
   7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', you can respond with NO.
       
   8.  OpenM-NT (Cache) sites - you do not need to move any routines, skip
       this step.
       
       DSM sites - you need to move several routines from your production
       account to manager account.  
       
          ZOSVKSD
          ZOSVKSOE
          ZOSVKSOS
          ZOSVKSVE

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch creates two new components that add the following functionality to 
KIDS:
 
  1. A KIDS Build component that allows users to export entries from the 
     PARAMETER DEFINITION File (#8989.51).
       a. Export the Parameter Definition for each entry.
 
       b. Export the entries in the PARAMETERS file (#8989.5) that pointed to 
       the exported Parameter Definition (Step A) and had as the entity the 
       package to which the KIDS build belongs. The package-level parameters 
       contained in the PARAMETERS file (#8989.5) are used as default values in 
       cases where the site hasn't set up or modified the parameter.
  
       c. Export the entries in PARAMETER ENTITY (#8989.518) file.
       
       d. Synchronize/resolve any issues with "pointed to" files and entries.
       
       e. The incoming data replaces any data at the site.
        
 
  2. A KIDS Build component that allows users to export entries from the 
     PARAMETER TEMPLATE File (#8989.52).
       a. Export the Parameter Template for each entry.
       
       b. Export each Parameter Definition (#8989.51) that is pointed to,
       without the PARAMETERS file (#8989.5) entry.

Patch XU*8*210, R/S Change Division
===================================

Problem Statement
=================

Patch XU*8*210 addresses the need for users at multi-divisional or consolidated sites to change the division they represent without having to sign out and then sign back onto the system. 

Patch Solution
==============

This patch introduces a new Kernel option XUSER DIV CHG, menu text: Change my 
Division. It has been added to the TBOX on the COMMON Menu.

Here is the Option description:

  The Kernel option "Change my Division" allows you to change the
  division to which you are currently assigned. This option performs
  the same function as entering your current division at the signon
  prompt "Select DIVISION: default division //".
 
  If you only have one division to select from, XUSER DIV CHG will show you 
  your current division and indicate that you cannot change it.
  
================
The following NOIS calls are also corrected:
HIN-0801-41754, FRE-0801-64066, BAC-0701-41456

The problem:
In the User Inquiry option, the CPRS Parameter Info is for the wrong
person.  It has been fixed to report for the correct person.

Patch XU*8.0*208, Strong Verify clean-up

This Patch Addresses the Following NOIS Calls:

2. FOR-0701-20582
3. CLE-0601-42777

5. MIN-0701-40152
6. DEN-0701-50838


Patch XU*8.0*208 is composed of the following two parts. Each part is described
in the form of a Problem Statement and Patch Solution as follows.

NOTE: All fields added or modified by this patch (XU*8.0*208) and referenced in
this patch description reside in the NEW PERSON file (#200).

Part 1 - Problem Statement:
---------------------------

Patch XU*8*180 introduced a feature whereby the DISUSER flag (#7) was set for
any user that had not signed onto the system in the last 90 days.  This caused
the problem that if the DISUSER flag was cleared and the user did not sign onto
the system before the next scheduled time for the XUAUTODEACTIVATE option to
run, the DISUSER flag was being set again, causing extra work for IRM. The same
problem occurred when a user that was reactivated did not sign onto the system
before the XUAUTODEACTIVATE option ran.

Part 1 - Patch Solution:
------------------------

To fix this problem, a new field ENTRY LAST EDIT DATE (#202.04) was added to
the NEW PERSON file (#200) to keep track of the date of some edits. The
following fields now trigger the current date to the ENTRY LAST EDIT DATE
field: DISUSER, ACCESS CODE (#2), and TERMINATION DATE (#9.2).

The conditions under which the DISUSER field is set have also been changed. If
any of the following conditions are true, we don't set the DISUSER flag:

        ;Last sign-on within 90 days
        ;User edited in last 30 days
        ;User set up in last 30 days
        ;Verify code changed in last 30 days

The TERMINATION DATE and DISUSER fields were moved to the first page of the
Edit an Existing User ScreenMan form to make them easier to see.


Part 2 - Problem Statement:
---------------------------

A problem was identified in that not all sign-on code (i.e. XUP, WebMail, POP3
server) was setting the LAST SIGN-ON DATE field (#202).

Part 2 - Patch Solution:
------------------------

The known places where this was happening have been fixed. Specifically they
were: XUP and XUSRA that POP3.  WEBMAIL has been patched on FORUM.

Patch XU*8*199: IOPAR Corrupting Tasks
================================
 
Per the patch description below, this patch was intended to correct a problem 
identified in NOIS reports NOIS: NAS-0700-31644, CHA-0700-32007, 
MIW-0201-40662, DAY-0401-41059, and BRX-0501-10502.
 
 
Problem Statement:
==============
 
The Text Integration Utility (TIU) has been encountering run away jobs at some 
sites due to the IO variable IOPAR being left behind by an earlier task.  After 
a lot of work by the sites, National Vista Support (NVS), and TIU developers, 
the following pattern has been identified:  Because the IOPAR variable is left
behind by an earlier task, it overrides the normal Open parameter in the DEVICE 
file (#3.5) if either conditions exist:
 
  * When TIU (or any routine making a call %ZTLOAD) queues to a Host File 
    System (HFS) device, they could experience this problem depending on what 
    devices had been used before.
 
  * If TaskMan opens the device for a task which cannot be opened,
    TaskMan reschedules the task incorrectly using that same IOPAR variable, 
    which is still in the symbol table.
 
 
Patch Solution:
===========
 
Several places in the code have been fixed to ensure that extra IO variables 
are not left behind after tasks have finished processing. This patch corrects 
the problem that the TIU has come across by changing the routine %ZTMS2 to kill 
the IOPAR variable before setting up the task. The %ZTMS2 routine now kills all 
IO variables before setting up a call to open a device. In addition, any 
special IO variables for that device are killed when the routine %ZISC is 
called to closed the device. 
 
This patch also introduces a new extrinsic function UNIQUE^ZISUTL, which 
creates a unique IO parameter. This parameter takes the string $H_"-"_$J and 
runs a CRC32 on it to get a 10 digit number.  If UNIQUE^ZISUTL is called using 
a parameter, it will concatenate the number just before the last period (.) in 
the parameter string. Here are some examples on this:
 
   W $$UNIQUE()       &gt;&gt;2987896688
   W $$UNIQUE("last") &gt;&gt;last_9041564
   W $$UNIQUE("$USR:[USER.FORT.EDIT]TEST.TMP")
                &gt;&gt;$USR:[USER.FORT.EDIT]TEST_2603399923.TMP

========================================================================= 
Installation:
 
&gt;&gt;&gt;Do not allow users to log in to the system during installation.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Users may remain on the system. They may get EDITED error if they
   are selecting a device at the time.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Taskman does need to be in a wait state.
 
  1.  DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
      so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
      
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
      
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
      On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
      
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
         
 4.  Users could remain on the system. They may get a EDITED error if they
     are selecting a device at the time.
     This patch can not be queued.
     Also place TASKMAN in a wait state. (DO WAIT^ZTMKU)
     Inhibit users from login into the system. (If you install when few
     users are on the system and the possibility of some CLOBER errors is
     acceptable, then users can stay on the system.)
      
  5.  In Programmer mode:
      Use "D ^XPDKRN" then
         Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*199'
                              =========
                              
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// YES
        
        No Options or Protocols need to be placed out-of-order.

  8.  After installing this patch,
      Cache Sites - you don't need to move anything, skip this step. 
      DSM/MSM sites - you need to move several routines from 
      your production account to each manager account:
      
ZIS
ZIS1
ZISC
ZISUTL
ZTMS2
      
  9.  And in the manager account,  (OpenM sites remain in VAH)
      All sites:
      DO RELOAD^ZTMGRSET
      Select the System
      Patch number to load: 199
                            ===

Patch XU*8*199, IOPAR Corrupting Tasks, was released on 11/21/01. After the 
release of Patch XU*8*199, a new problem was discovered in the use and 
setting of the IOCPU variable. Unfortunately, this underlying problem was 
not discovered during the testing phase. To cause the problem you had to 
use OPEN^%ZISH to open the host file and use ^%ZISC to close it, then 
without calling ^%ZIS use OPEN^%ZISH again to open a host file when you 
call ^%ZISC the file would not get closed. Patch XU*8*216 corrects this 
problem. If sites installed any local modifications to correct this 
problem, based on advice provided by NVS in NOIS, please remove them prior 
to or immediately after the installation of this patch.  We regret the 
error and any inconvenience this has caused.

Patch XU*8*215
 
This patch introduces the following three enhancements.
 
1. A new function named GETPEER has been created to get the IP address of 
the caller to the TCP service. It has been designed to specifically work 
with a device connected as a TCP/IP listener in support of RPCBroker.
 
2. In SHARELIC^%ZOSV, the call made to the Cache operating system utility 
^%LICENSE have, in some cases, been resulting in errors which changed 
the way other errors get handled. This has been resolved by seeing that  
$ECODE variable is cleared after the call.
 
3. Correctly add together the enterprise and division licenses in the 
$$AVJ^%ZOSV call.  $$AVJ is used by Kernel to check how many available jobs 
are on the system.  Only a few sites have division licenses. Most have 
enterprise licenses.

** WARNING ** WARNING ** WARNING ** WARNING ** WARNING ** WARNING **
 
If your site does not purge old alerts the post install routine,
which reindexes the "B" cross-reference of the FILE: ALERT TRACKING
(# 8992.1), may take considerably longer than would be the case if you
regularly purge.  In that case, you will want to schedule the
installation so the post installation routine may run on a weekend or
overnight.
 
--------------------------- End of Warning -------------------------
 
1. Surrogates for processing alerts may have an end date and time for the
surrogate relationship.  The actual removal of the surrogate has been
performed when the next alert was sent to an individual.  This resulted,
however, in the user still appearing to have a surrogate after the
stated end time if another user tried to set them as their surrogate.
This patch modifies the processing so that the removal of the specified
surrogate happens on any surrogate related look-up after the specified end
time.  This will correct the problem that had been reported (E3R #14940).
 
2. Code has been modified to correct problems identified with setting
surrogates (BRX-1000-10427, COS-0401-41366, WRJ-1201-11337).
 
3. The problem indicated as a mismatch in XQAID values (ISL-0200-52883) is
handled by a re-indexing of the "B" cross-reference in FILE: ALERT
TRACKING (#8992.1) in the post-installation routine.
 
4. A small change was made in XQALERT to clarify the way in which alerts
are referenced from the menu system (ISL-0898-51279) and to correct a
potential problem with matching the "B" cross-reference in FILE: ALERT
TRACKING (#8992.1).
 
5. A cross-reference was added to FIELD: SURROGATE (#.02) of FILE: ALERT
(#8992) to permit rapid lookup of users who have specified a selected user
as their surrogate (E3R #15158).  This is made available via the "XQAL
SURROGATE FOR WHICH USERS" (View Surrogate for Which Users) option on the
XQALERT MGR menu.  The supported reference API SUROFOR^XQALSURO has been
added for other applications to access this data.
 
    D SUROFOR^XQALSURO(.LIST,USERDUZ)
 
will return data in the variable LIST.  The value of LIST indicates the
number of entries returned.  The array list will return the users DUZ
value in file 200 and the NAME (.01) field from file 200 separated by an
'^'.
      LIST = 3
      LIST(1) = "54^LNAME1,FNAME1"
      LIST(2) = "75^LNAME2,FNAME2"
      LIST(3) = "247^LNAME3,FNAME3"
 
The post-install routine, XQAL173P, also builds the cross-reference for
current surrogates.  This routine is set to be removed following the
installation.
 
6. In addition, it was noted that while interactive specification of a
surrogate checked for cyclic relationships among surrogates, the API for
non-interactive setting of a surrogated (SETSURO^XQALSURO) simply set the
specified surrogate.  While this API can continue to be used, a new API
(SETSURO1^XQALSURO) has been created which should be used to obtain a
return value (1 if successful, 0 if not successful) indicating whether the
surrogate could be set.
 
  S VAL=$$SETSURO1^XQALSURO(USERDUZ,SURODUZ,STRTDATE,ENDDATE)
 
 
Where USERDUZ and SURODUZ are the internal entry numbers in file 200 for
the user and selected surrogate, respectively.  STRTDATE and ENDDATE are
optional date/time values for when the surrogate relationship should
start and end.  If STRTDATE is not specified, the surrogate becomes active
immediately.  If ENDDATE is not specified, the surrogate remains active
until another surrogate is specified or the surrogate is removed.

Installation Instructions:
 
     1.   Users ARE allowed to be on the system during the
     installation but if you have not recently run a scheduled purge of
     old alerts you may want to schedule the installation for off hours.
 
     2.   DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
     so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
 
     3.   Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.
     This option will load the KIDS (Kernel Installation and Distribution
     System) package onto your system.
 
     4.   You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.
 
     5.   The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your
     system.  On the KIDS menu, select the 'Installation' menu and use
     the following options:
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Print Transport Global
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Backup a Transport Global

 1. This patch provides a change in the "XUS KEY CHECK" RPC necessary
    for other applications to use the RPC to full advantage.  Whereas
    the RPC would originally return an indicator of whether the current
    user owned the key or keys, this adds an additional argument which
    can be used to specify another user's DUZ value, and the check will
    be performed on the key(s) for that user.  If this argument is not
    specified, it will perform the test for the current user, as it has 
    done in the past.

Test Site: ANCHORAGE
Blood Bank Clearence: 4/12/2002

Problem: The call to Intersystems' license share should only be called for 
Telnet and TCP connections. Not for LAT.
Fix: This patch changes ZU to check the type of device and only call the 
Intersystems License share code for Telnet connections, this is done 
for both DSM and Cache. 

NOIS: LOU-0601-40314, LEX-0401-42341, COA-0401-21786, HVH-0101-11346
Problem: TCP clients on Cache were opened in 'mumps' mode, this caused some 
problems when talking with DSM systems. This caused problems with HL7.
Fix: This patch changes the way that TCP devices are opened on Cache 
systems to be in packet mode.  This makes it behave more like the way that 
DSM does.

NOIS: HVH-0101-11346, COA-0401-21786, LEX-0401-42341, LOU-0601-40314
Problem: ZISTCPS would halt when told to stop.  When called from a job 
started by Taskman the task would not be cleaned up. This caused problems 
with HL7.
Fix: To have ZISTCPS just QUIT when told to stop.

Problem: VMS and DSM utilities require the job number in hex, but Taskman 
listing would just show the job number in decimal.
Fix: In a task listing of running tasks, include the job number in hex when 
the job numbers is greater that 2048.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Alerts are used to send time sensitive notifications for information or
for further processing.  When created, some alerts may specify a number of
days for forwarding to a supervisor or to e-mail surrogates.  If the alert
remains unread after this period of time the alert is forwarded, if
possible, to a supervisor or e-mail surrogate as indicated.  A problem has
been reported when after the alert has been forwarded to the backup
individual, it is repeatedly reforwarded on following days until the alert
is removed either manually or as a result of normal alert removal
(SHR-0100-70069).  This patch corrects this behavior, so the alert will
only be forwarded once.
 
In addition, there have been some who wanted these unread alerts forwarded
to a specific individual, e.g., someone in QA, who would monitor unread
alerts and could insure forwarding to proper individuals if they could not
process them fully (ASH-0100-31970).  To assist in this capability, the
current patch also adds a 'DAYS FOR BACKUP REVIEWER' (#.15) field to the
'ALERT DATE/TIME(#1)' subfile of the 'ALERT(#8992)' file.  In addition, it
adds an 'XQAL BACKUP REVIEWER' entry in the PARAMETER DEFINITION 
(#8989.51) file, and an option, Set Backup Reviewer for Alerts [XQAL SET
BACKUP REVIEWER] on the Alert Management [XQALERT MGR] menu.
 
 
If an alert is generated with a number of days specified in the variable
XQAREVUE, after the specified number of days has passed if the alert
remains unread, and if a valid entry is present in the ALERT BACKUP
REVIEWER parameter for the User, Service, Division, or System 
entities,        
the  alert will be forwarded to the indicated individual at the lowest
level found for processing.

Installation Instructions:
 
     1.   Users ARE allowed to be on the system during the
     installation.
 
     2.   DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
     so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
 
     3.   Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.
     This option will load the KIDS (Kernel Installation and Distribution
     System) package onto your system.
 
     4.   You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.
 
     5.   The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your
     system.  On the KIDS menu, select the 'Installation' menu and use
     the following options:
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Print Transport Global
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Backup a Transport Global
 
           Return to Programmers Prompt and use "D ^XPDKRN":

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch removes a command that is not necessary and conflicts with 
the M-to-M Broker.
 
Other than removing this one command, this patch is equivalent to 
XU*8*234.  For those sites which do not install various packages, e.g., 
CMOP, etc., this patch may be installed without installation of patch 
XU*8*234 (which was released as a part of YS*5.01*71).  However, if 
such a site subsequently installs XU*8*234 after this patch, this patch 
should be installed again.

Installation Instructions: 
==========================
This patch can be installed with VISTA users online.  However, it is 
recommended that it be Queued for a time of generally least activity.  
 
TaskMan does not need to be STOPPED or placed in a WAIT state and 
installation should take less than a minute.
 
     1.  AXP/DSM sites: No review of mapped routine set is necessary 
since these routines are new.
 
     2.  Shutdown all Logical Links, incoming and outgoing filers, and
the Link Manager using the Filer and Link Management options listed 
below:
 
       Stop All Messaging Background Processes [HL STOP ALL]
       TCP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL START/STOP LINK MANAGER]
 
       AXP/DSM SITES ONLY: Disable all HL7 UCX Services for this
       installation.
 
     3.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.  
This option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
 
     4.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your 
system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.  
  
     5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
following options: 
            Print Transport Global 
            Compare Transport Global to Current System 
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
            Backup a Transport Global 
 
     6.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
following option: 
            Select Installation Option: Install Package(s) 
            Select INSTALL NAME: XU*8*239
                                 ==========
 
        Answer 'NO' to 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
        Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
        and Protocols? 
 
    7.  Start up all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers using 
the Filer and Link Management Option's 'Restart/Start All Links and 
Filers 
[HL TASK RESTART]' menu option.
 
       (Note that links that do not have "autostart" enabled will need
       to be restarted manually.)
 
       AXP/DSM SITES ONLY: If you previously disabled an HL7 UCX Service
       for this installation, you may enable it now.
 
     8.  AXP/DSM Sites - After the patch has been installed, no rebuilding
your map set is necessary.

XU*8.0*296

NOIS: ISD-0500-72669
Test Sites: Dallas OIFO
Blood Bank Team Clearance: 4/9/03

The Kernel Part III post routine, XUINCON - BUILDS ACCESSIBLE FILE MULTIPLE,
sets the NEW PERSON (#200) file's ACCESSIBLE FILE (#200.032) sub-file's
WRITE ACCESS (#5) field to zero at D1+1^XUINCON.  The Set of Codes field
definition does not define 0 as an allowed value.  This causes "0" to
display during display functions instead of null or NO.

To fix this, "0" (meaning NO) is being added to the set of codes for this
field and the others in this multiple.

This patch contains no routines; only the DD changes.

XU*8.0*297

NOIS: PUG-0403-50483
Test Sites: Puget Sound HCS
Blood Bank Team Clearance: 4/11/03

This patch concerns the SPOOL DOCUMENT (#3.51) file.

1. The length of the "B" xref on the NAME (#.01) field is increased from 30
to 63 characters so that more of the name appears when the user enters '?'
to get a list of spool documents when using option [XU-SPL-PRINT] Print A
Spool Document.  The post-init (POST^XU8P297) for this patch will kill
the existing "B" xref and reindex the NAME (#.01) field.  Here's the new DD
for that field.  Nothing's changed, except the size of the "B" xref.

           DESCRIPTION:      This field holds the name of the spool
                             document.  To avoid device handler confusion,
                             the name of the spool document must not look
                             like the name of a terminal type, e.g. C-VT100,
                             since either name might be contained in a
                             response to the device prompt.

2. The print template [XU-ZISPL-USER] is altered so that the first 44 (up
from 20) characters of the spool document names are shown when using option
[XU-SPL-LIST] List Spool Documents.  During the install, you will see the
following message:
 The following Routines were created during this install:
     XUCT02
XUCT02 is the routine into which the print template is compiled.

NOIS: NHM-0500-11955
Test Sites: Northampton, MA
Blood Bank Team Clearance: 5/1/2003

This patch concerns the PERSON CLASS (#200.05) subfile of the NEW PERSON
(#200) file.

Sometimes, a user's PERSON CLASS history can look pretty confusing:

Person Class                        Effective        Expired
 Nursing Service                    OCT 1,1995       NOV 17,1998
 Nursing Service                    NOV 17,1998      APR 13,2000
 Nursing Service                    APR 13,2000      JUN 2,1998  &lt;&lt;problem
 Physician Assistants &amp; Advanced Practice  JUN 2,1998  OCT 1,1995 &lt;problem
 Physician Assistants &amp; Advanced Practice  OCT 1,1995

1. The API $$GET^XUA4A72, given a person and a date, retrieves the active
class for that person on that date.  It can get confused when confronted
with problems such as those above, and return an error (no active class for
this person on this date) for 5/18/2000, for example.  This patch makes the
API a bit smarter.  It will return the last person class for 5/18/2000.  It
will return the same one (not the first one) for 11/1/1996.

2. When a new PERSON CLASS record is added to the multiple, the expired date
of the previous one is set to the effective date of the new one.  If the
effective date of the new one is prior to the effective date of the previous
one, this results in records such as those marked "problem" above. To remedy
this, we add a simple check: If the Effective Date of the previous class is
greater than the Effective Date of the new class, then we set the Expired
Date of the previous class to be the same as its Effective Date.

3. Patch XU*8*49 purportedly prevented you from adding a new PERSON CLASS
record with an effective date prior to the effective date of the previous
one.  It didn't work.  This patch does.  A new input transform on the
Effective Date (#2) field sees to it.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch provides several reporting options for Alerts, including
ones that: list users with large number of alerts in the ALERTS file
(#8992); list alerts for a specified user from a specified date; list
alerts for a specified patient for a specified day or date range. 
Since the retention period for alerts in the ALERT TRACKING file
(#8992.1) is currently a site parameter, some users may have alerts
in the ALERTS file that no longer are present in the ALERT TRACKING file,
data from both sources is used when necessary.
 
This patch adds the following options:
 
Report Menu for Alerts (XQAL REPORTS MENU)
 
This menu provides several options for generating reports on alerts for
users or patients.
 
 
User Alerts Count Report  (XQAL USER ALERTS COUNT)
 
This option is used to generate a report on users who have more than a
specified number of alerts in the ALERTS file (#8992).  The report covers
a specified range of dates, and can be sorted by user name, number of
alerts, or by service/section.  In addition, the report in each of these
formats may be generated by Divisions if desired.
 
For each user who has the specified number of alerts or more, the report
includes the user name, the section/service for the user, the number of
alerts in the ALERTS file, the last sign-on date, the number of Critical
alerts or Abnormal Imaging alerts, and the date of the oldest alert.
 
The counting of alerts may also be restricted to those alerts which contain 
specific text or phrases.
 
 
Critical Alerts Count Report (XQAL CRITICAL ALERT COUNT)
 
This option is used to generate a report of users who have more than a
specified number of alerts containing the word 'critical' or the words
'abnormal imaging' between the specified start and end dates. The report
is presented in descending order for the number of critical/abnormal
imaging alerts present.
 
For each user who has the specified number of critical/abnormal
imaging alerts or more, the report includes the user name, the
section/service for the user, the number of alerts in the ALERTS file, the
last sign-on date, the number of Critical alerts or Abnormal Imaging
alerts, and the date of the oldest alert.
 
 
List Alerts for a user from a specified date (XQAL ALERT LIST FROM DATE)
 
This option is used to obtain a list of alerts from the ALERT TRACKING
file (#8992.1) for a specified user for a specified date range.  The user
may select all of the alerts to be displayed, or enter specific text or
phrases to select only alerts which contain the specified text.  In the
latter case, the user may also select to see only those alerts which match
the criteria and are only info only alerts, only action alerts, or both.
 
The listing includes the internal entry number for the alert in the ALERT
TRACKING file, the date and time the alert was generated, the message
text of the alert, and information about any option or routine to be
executed for processing the alert.
 
 
Patient Alert List for specified date (XQAL PATIENT ALERT LIST)
 
This option is used to obtain a list of alerts for a specified patient
from the ALERT TRACKING file (#8992.1) for a selected date range (it is
recommended that this range be only a few days at most, since every entry
in the ALERT TRACKING file in the selected date range must be checked to
provide a complete listing of alerts for a patient).
 
A prompt is provided to obtain a quick scan listing of dates with at least
some alerts for the patient on it based on OR and DVB alerts (other
patient related alerts need to be identified by looking at each alert's
message text and are included in the full list, but not the quick scan).
 
The user may select all of the alerts to be displayed, or enter specific
text or phrases to select only alerts which contain the specified text. 
In the latter case, the user may also select to see only those alerts
which match the criteria and are info only alerts, only action alerts,
or both.
 
The listing includes the internal entry number for the alert in the ALERT
TRACKING file, the date and time the alert was generated, the message
text of the alert, and information about any option or routine to be
executed for processing the alert.
 
 
View data for Alert Tracking file entry  (XQAL VIEW ALERT TRACKING ENTRY)
 
This option can be used to obtain a listing of data in captioned format for
selected entries in the ALERT TRACKING file (#8992.1).  The internal entry
numbers for the entries to be listed must be entered individually.
 
 
There were no NOIS or E3Rs related to this patch.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Read the WARNING below carefully prior to installing this patch.
 
This patch addresses a patient safety issue in which alerts sent to an
inactive user were not received by anyone.  If there are no active
recipients or surrogates among the list of specified recipients the alert
will be directed to the appropriate BACKUP REVIEWER as determined from the
PARAMETERS file.  If there is no identifiable BACKUP REVIEWER entry, the
alert will be sent to members of the "XQAL UNPROCESSED ALERTS" mail
group.  If there are no active members specified for that mail group, the
alert will be sent as a last resort to members of G.PATCH.
 
 
*************************** WARNING ************************************
 
The number of alerts generated to inactive users may be very large.  Your
staff may need assistance in dealing with them and, in the case of unsigned
documents, (many of the alerts) someone available to sign them.  You will
not see alerts to inactive users from CPRS unless patch OR*3*200 (which will 
be released shortly after this patch) has been installed.
 
*************************************************************************
 
In the roll-and-scroll or List Manager environment, this patch causes
alerts which contain the text "CRITICAL" or "ABNORMAL IMA" are displayed in
reverse video to cause these alert to stand out in the midst of many other
alerts.
 
It was found that sending an alert to a mail group, only the individual
members were identified.  This has been modified to include other mail
groups which are members of the mail group as well.
 
The XQAL UNPROCESSED ALERTS mail group is created by this patch and during
the Post-Init phase the individual installing the patch will be set up as
a member of the mail group.  We recommend that this mail group be
populated with a few individuals who can forward otherwise undelivered
alerts on to a proper individuals.
 
An option was earlier provided for establishing individuals as BACKUP
REVIEWER entries in the PARAMETER FILE, but the original option did not
provide an easy way in which to delete or edit the entry.  This has been
corrected in this patch.
 
This patch also corrects undefined errors which occur sporadically at
DELETEA+7^XQALDEL and at DELA+1^XQALDEL.
 
For Developers, a new input variable during generation of alerts is
XQADFN.  This value should contain the DFN value for the patient if the
alert is patient related.  Use of this variable will provide a more
reliable indicator of the patient than that previously used (the second
comma piece of the value of XQAID as used by CPRS).
 
 
 
For Developers this patch adds the following APIs as Supported References:
 
This patch creates a new entry point for setting up alerts. SETUP1^XQALERT
is now recommended for creation of an alert.  It is used in the form
  S RETVAL=$$SETUP1^XQALERT
the value returned is a string with the first '^'-piece a 1 if the alert
was delivered to at least one valid recipient or 0 if the alert could not
be delivered.  In the latter case, the variable XQALERR will be defined
and contain a string explaining why the alert was not delivered.  The second
'^'-piece is the IEN in the Alert Tracking file for the alert and the third
'^'-piece is the complete value of XQAID for the alert.  The second or third
piece values may be used by an application to retain a reference to the
alert in the ALERT TRACKING file (#8992.1).
 
 
The original entry point SETUP^XQALERT for creating an alert did not
return any indication if an alert was not deliverable for any reason. This
entry point is still valid for backward compatibility, but no longer
recommended.
 
$$ACTVSURO^XQALSURO(IENVALUE) - returns the currently active surrogate for
the user specified.  This includes potential surrogates of the current
surrogate. To determine the currently active surrogate for the user with
DUZ of IENVALUE, use
   S ACTIVE=$$ACTVSURO^XQALSURO(IENVALUE)
If the returned value is greater than zero, it will indicate the active
surrogate.  If the returned value is not greater than zero (actually -1),
it will indicate that there are no currently active surrogates for the
user.
 
$$CHEKUSER^XQALSET(IENVALUE) - Returns 0 if no valid user or surrogate,
otherwise returns IEN of user or his currently active surrogate
 
Addition of the ALERT RECIPIENT TYPE file (#8992.2)
---------------------------------------------------
 
The ALERT RECIPIENT TYPE file was added to contain indicators as to why
an alert was sent.

                  DESCRIPTION:    This field is used to track how a specific

                                  may be the result of forwarding.
                                  Recipients of the alert from forwarding
                                  are noted by the type of forwarding involved

Patch Tracking #: 37387952
Test Sites: FORUM, NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HCS, Boston Healthcare System 
            CPRS v25 t12 test sites.  Blood Bank Clearance: 3/18/2004 
 
This patch adds two parameters to XUP with SYS or USR values that can be set to
control XUP. The first is "XUS-XUP SET ERROR TRAP".  If set this will set an
error trap to return to XUP and ask if the error should be recorded. The other
is "XUS-XUP VPE" for users that like to work in the VPE environment, setting
this parameter will cause XUP, if the Select OPTION NAME: is skipped, to branch
to the VPE environment.  
 
NOIS: ISL-0103-52332 This Patch adds a new API in a new routine for
applications to use to check and see if they are running in a PRODUCTION
account or a TEST account.  Integration #: 4440 
 
The new API is: 
 $$PROD^XUPROD([force]) 
  It returns 1 if the current account is a production account.  
  It returns 0 if it is a TEST account.  
  
  The parameter value of 1, allows an application to force a full test.  
 
These is a new Menu item under the "Kernel Management Menu", "Ask if Production
Account" (XU SID ASK) this option will ask if the current account is the
Production account.  If the answer is "Yes" then the current SID is set as the
production SID so checks will return 1.  If account is not the production
account then a fake value is stored so that the check will return 0.  The first
check each day will force a full test.  
 
The option "Startup PROD check" (XU SID STARTUP) should be added to the Taskman
scheduling file and scheduled for startup so that when Taskman start the SID is
also checked.  
 
Other required patches: For GT.M sites, XU*8*275 has the needed change 
to ZOSVGTM.

List of preceding patches: 215, 258, 293
Sites should use CHECK^XTSUMBLD to verify checksums.  
 
=========================================================================
Installation: 
 
&gt;&gt;&gt;Allow KIDS to Inhibit logon's during the install.  
&gt;&gt;&gt;TaskMan does *not* need to be stopped.  
 
  1.  DSM sites - If any of these routines are mapped, 
      you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.  
 
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This 
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
 
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your 
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  
      On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following 
      options: 
 
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
         Print Transport Global 
         Compare Transport Global to Current System 
         Backup a Transport Global 
 
 4.   Allow KIDS to Inhibit logon's during the install. (There is a small
      chance that a few users could get CLOBER errors.) 
      TaskMan does not need to be stopped.  
 
  5.  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  
      In Programmer mode: 
      Use "D ^XPDKRN" then 
         Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*284' 
                              ==========
 
      Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES// YES 
        
      Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// YES 
 
      Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? YES// NO 
      
  8.  After installing this patch, 
      Cache/GTM Sites - you don't need to move anything, skip this step.  
      DSM sites - you need to move one routine from 
      your production account to each manager account: ZOSVVXD 
 
  9.  DSM in the manager account,  (Cache/GTM sites remain in VAH) 
      All sites: 
      DO RELOAD^ZTMGRSET 
      Select the System 
      Patch number to load: 284 
                            ===
 
 10.  DSM Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.  
 
 11.  In the VAH account: 
      Please run the Memu option "Ask if  Production Account" (XU SID ASK).  
      This will ask if the current account is the Production account.  
      Please answer acordinly. 
 
      The Option "Startup PROD check" (XU SID STARTUP) should be scheduled 
      for startup so that when TaskMan starts the SID is checked.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 Patch XU*8*366 (RETURN ALERTS FROM SURROGATE) resolves a patient safety
 issue (PSI-04-036) by modifying the handling of alerts sent to surrogates
 to return unprocessed alerts to the originally intended recipient of the
 alert after a surrogacy period ends.  As a byproduct of the changes made,
 it is now possible to schedule multiple different (temporal) surrogate
 periods in advance.
 
 Alerts are sent to the specified surrogate, or surrogates if there is a
 sequence of consecutive periods of surrogacy.  When a user requests a
 listing of alerts AND THERE ARE NO CURRENT SURROGATES (either due to the
 end of the surrogacy period or removal of the last surrogate) alerts which
 were sent to the surrogate(s) and have not been processed by the surrogate
 are returned to the user as new alerts with a comment indicating they were
 returned from the surrogate.  If the surrogate was not an intended
 recipient of the alert(s), either as an initially specified recipient or
 by receiving the alert by forwarding from another recipient, the alert will
 be deleted from the surrogate.  If the surrogate was an intended recipient
 of the alert it will also remain with the surrogate.
 
 A consequence of the modifications made to track the periods of surrogacy
 is the ability to add multiple surrogate periods with different start times.
 The  most recent active start time determines which of the surrogate periods
 is active.  Therefore, the termination date/time for a given period of
 surrogacy, if specified, only determines the end of the surrogacy if no
 other surrogacy period starts prior to that time.  It does not determine
 the actual end time if another period of surrogacy starts before the
 specified end time (or there was no end time specified).  A pair of
 users can be specified in advance as mutual surrogates with opposite rolls,
 as long as the periods of surrogacy do not overlap resulting in a circular
 relationship.
 
 In the Roll and Scroll environment, selection of Surrogate processing will
 list current surrogate(s) and give the option to remove one or more of the
 surrogates, and the option to add a surrogate, which if it is a later start
 date/time than a currently active or scheduled surrogate, will become active
 at the date/time specified.
 
 A new supported reference (SUROLIST^XQALSURO) has been added to provide a
 list of current and scheduled surrogates for a user.
 
 D SUROLIST^XQALSURO(XQAUSER,.XQALIST)
 
 where XQALIST is passed by reference.  On return XQALIST contains the
 number of entries returned, and an array containing the current and
 scheduled surrogates with '^'-separated values for internal entry number in
 the NEW PERSON file (#200), the value for the NAME field (#.01) from the
 NEW PERSON file (#200), the start date/time for the surrogacy period and the
 end date/time for the surrogacy period.  If a surrogate has no end date/time
 value and is followed by another surrogate, the first surrogate will show an
 end date/time value equal to the start date/time of the following surrogate.
 
 returns  XQALIST=count
          XQALIST(1)=IEN2^NEWPERSON,USER2^STARTDATETIME^ENDDATETIME
          XQALIST(2)=3^NAME,USER3^3050407.1227^3050409
 
 The supported reference to remove surrogates (REMVSURO^XQALSURO) has been
 modified to add two additional OPTIONAL arguments which specify the IEN of
 a surrogate and the start date/time for that surrogate session to be removed
 (these values can be obtained with the SUROLIST^XQALSURO call described
 above).  If these two optional arguments are not specified, the call to
 REMVSURO^XQALSURO will remove the current or next scheduled surrogate entry
 (as it has in the past).
 
 These features will become active in windowed applications, such as CPRS,
 only after the applications implement code changes to take advantage of the
 new functionality included in this patch.
 
 The following field (and sub-file) was added to the ALERT file (#8992):
 
 8992,2        SURROGATE              2;0 DATE Multiple #8992.02
 
               DESCRIPTION:      This field is a multiple based on the start
                                 date/time for a surrogate relationship.  This
                                 will permit multiple surrogate relationships
                                 to be scheduled.
 
                                 Since a start date/time for the surrogate
                                 relationship is required, if the user does not
                                 enter one, then the NOW as the current
                                 date/time will be used.

      1.   Users ARE allowed to be on the system during the
      installation.
 
      2.   DSM sites - Some of these routines are usually mapped,
      so you will need to disable mapping for the affected routines.
 
      3.   Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.
      This option will load the KIDS (Kernel Installation and Distribution
      System) package onto your system.
 
      4.   You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.
 
      5.   The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your
      system.  On the KIDS menu, select the 'Installation' menu and use
      the following options:
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            Print Transport Global
            Compare Transport Global to Current System
            Backup a Transport Global
 
            Return to Programmers Prompt and use "D ^XPDKRN":
            Select KIDS OPTION: Install
                                =======

      6.  AXP Sites - Answer 'NO' to the question 'Want to MOVE
      routines to other CPUs?'.
 
 
      7.  If the routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;481 SEQ #400</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2009-04-21 14:07:07</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-17.html">USER,SEVENTEEN</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch contains enhancements and modifications to the XUS NPI EXTRACT
REPORT [XUS NPI EXTRACT] option which is already loaded at the sites.  The
changes contained in this patch address the following:
  
1. With the installation of this patch, an approved Chief Business Office
   (CBO) staff member (with a valid network user identification and 
   password), shall have the ability to remotely schedule the XUS NPI
   EXTRACT REPORT [XUS NPI EXTRACT] option to run at each selected site 
   on a chosen date or dates. This new functionality will replace the
   currently scheduled Task Manager task (which was set up by site
   Information Resource Management (IRM) staff with the installation of
   patch XU*8.0*453) which automatically runs the extract every three
   months.
   
2. This patch addresses an issue found with sites that did not choose to
   install the PSO*7.0*273 patch.  Any such sites were receiving a
   &lt;NOROUTINE&gt; error when attempting to run the extract (See Remedy Ticket
   217164 below). A solution has been included which will prevent this 
   error from occurring.
   
3. This patch also changes both the format of and the number of 
   verification messages that get sent when the XUS NPI EXTRACT REPORT
   option [XUS NPI EXTRACT] is run.  Currently, a verification email
   message is sent to each member of the "NPI EXTRACT VERIFICATION" mail
   group for each extract mail message that is created.  With the
   installation of this patch, only one verification message will be
   created and sent to each member of the "NPI EXTRACT VERIFICATION" mail
   group.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch was created to support Outpatient Pharmacy in printing Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) Medication Guide documents using a Java
application. These documents are in Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf),
which is a file format not supported by VistA.
 
A new field, WINDOWS NETWORK PRINTER NAME (#75), is being added to the
DEVICE file (#3.5). This field will be used to store the Windows network
printer name, which VistA passes on to a Java Application responsible
for printing FDA Medication Guide documents.
 
New field in the DEVICE file (#3.5) - WINDOWS NETWORK PRINTER NAME (#75)

                               printer (e.g., '\\vhaistfpc4\IST-HP4525-1').
                               It is used by Windows applications that
                               interact with VistA and need a printer 
                               identified for output purposes. 
 
The new field can be edited via the Edit All Device Fields [XUDEVEDITALL] 
option under the Kernel Device Management options as seen below:
