===========================================================================
 This patch should be installed after hours, when there is minimum users on
 the system.  You should put the XMUSER Option out of order.
  
===========================================================================
INSTALLATION:
  1.  These routines are usually mapped on systems that allow mapping,
      so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routines.
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  3.  Answer NO to the question:
      'Shall I preserve what is on disk in a separate back-up message ?'.
  4.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
  5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the option 
      'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' and verify that all routines
      have the correct checksums.
  6.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the option 
      'Install Package(s)'. Select the package 'XM*7.1*24' and proceed
      with install.
  7.  Answer YES to the question:
      'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options and Menu Options?'
  8.  Enter XMUSER at the question:
      'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':'
  9.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
      other CPUs?'.
 10.  AXP Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 This Mailman patch will set the vaporization date for messages that are
 distributed via the XMYB-BROADCAST-VA-WIDE Server Option, for example, 
 Secretary Brown's Daily Message. The vaporization date is set only if
 the message stays in the users IN BASKET. If a user saves the message to
 another Basket, the vaporization date is not maintained. A user can enter
 a new vaporization date by entering 'V' at the 'MESSAGE Action' prompt.

 This patch will not effect broadcast messages that originate locally, but 
 only those originated from FORUM. The vaporization date is depended on how
 the parameter is set in the Routine field for the XMYB-BROADCAST-VA-WIDE
 Option.
 
 Case #1 - if Routine field looks like: ENT^XMGAPI3("*"), this means
 that the message was sent to ALL mail users, then the Vaporization date
 will be set to T+7.
 
 Case #2 - if the Routine entry looks like: ENT^XMAPI3(".6"), this means
 that the message was sent to *just* SHARED MAIL's IN BASKET, then the
 Vaporization date will be set to T+30.
===========================================================================

 This patch can be installed with users on the system.

  4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global
         Backup a Transport Global
         Install Package(s)

===========================================================================
 *** You MUST install Kernel patch XU*8*24 before installing this patch ***

 This patch should be installed after hours, when there is minimum users on
 the system.  You should put the XMUSER Option out of order.

 MSM Sites: The routine XMRTCP must be moved to your NT machine and then
 reboot MSM on the NT machine.  This will restart the TCP/IP poller.
===========================================================================

INSTALLATION:
  1.  These routines are usually mapped on systems that allow mapping,
      so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routines.
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
  4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
         Install Package(s)
  5.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
      other CPUs?'. Enter the names of your Compute and Print server(s).
  6.  AXP Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.

   from this option.


 DATA DICTIONARY:  Partial DD

  File:  DOMAIN #4.2

   Field:
    4      TRANSMISSION SCRIPT
    Subfield:
    1.5    OUT OF SERVICE
             This is the preferred field to set to take a script out of
             service,to prevent it from being used.

  File:  MESSAGE STATISTICS #4.2999

   Fields:
    41     XMIT START DATE/TIME
             This field helps MailMan determine, after a fatal error,
             whether to start the transmission process at script 1,
             try 1, or to start elsewhere.

    42     XMIT FINISH DATE/TIME
             This may be useful information for debugging purposes.

    43     XMIT SCRIPT
             This tells MailMan which script is/was being used.

    44     XMIT TRIES
             This tells MailMan how many tries have been made with
             the current script.

    45     XMIT LATEST TRY DATE/TIME
             This may be useful information for debugging purposes.

    46     XMIT SCRIPT CYCLE ITERATIONS
             This is the number of script cycles we have tried.  This
             field starts off at 0.  After we have tried all the scripts
             available, we bump up this field by 1.

MailMan patch XM*7.1*38 is a patch for XM*7.1*27.  It contains the following
bug fix:

Fixes 'undefined variable' problem with the variable XMB("ITERATIONS").
This problem occurs when patch XM*7.1*27 is loaded after remote transmission
tasks have been queued, but before they have a chance to run.

===========================================================================
 This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at
 a minimum.  You should put the XMUSER Option out of order.

 MSM Sites: The routine XMRTCP must be moved to your NT machine and then
 reboot MSM on the NT machine.  This will restart the TCP/IP poller.

MailMan Patch XM*7.1*31

NOIS: BRX-0496-11847     Routines: ^XMA5,^XMA5A
 Fixes subscript error when  QD'ing numeric recipients, such as those
 @AOL.COM

NOIS: DAY-0995-40521     Routines: ^XMA21
 Removes phantom recipients when using XMY array during programmer calls
 to ^XMB(bulletin) or ^XMD(message).

NOIS: NAS-1295-30255     Routines: ^XMB1
      CLE-0396-41473
 Later'd messages report will now appear even if ^'d out of prior option.

      MAD-0196-40136
      MCM-0896-50571
 Fixes error caused by Later'd messages becoming new after the user has
 been deactivated and deleted from ^XMB(3.7.

NOIS: TOM-1195-41441     Routines: ^XMA21
 Sender doesn't have to broadcast twice when forwarding.

NOIS: CMO-1195-40423     Routines: ^XMA24
 Lets sender deselect ('-*') broadcast.

NOIS: FTM-1195-41507     Routines: ^XMA24
 Ask sender for basket when sending to SHARED,MAIL, whether or not "ask
 basket" is set to "yes".

NOIS: GRJ-1094-50087      Routines: ^XMA21G
 Make error message clearer by changing from "not found" to "mail group
 not found".

NOIS: none                Routines: ^XMA21,^XMA210
 No Nois, refer to FORUM mail msg 19872177.
 If user enters a number in response to 'send to:' prompt, and the DUZ is
 not found in ^VA(200, MailMan will no longer try to use the number as an
 IEN to pick out a mail name or remote user.

NOIS: MWV-0396-21324      Routines: ^XMA21,^XMA21G
 This concerns what happens when a user deselects an addressee (-name or
 -g.group) at a 'send to:' prompt, after already broadcasting ('*').
 If "-g.group", MailMan lets the user know that the message will still go
 to all local users.
 If "-name", MailMan checks to see if the "name" is already specified as a
 recipient.  If he is, then MailMan tells the user that the message will still
 go to all local users.  If he isn't, then MailMan just tells the user that
 "name" is not found.

E3R: 8885                 Routines: ^XMA21
 Removes all SSN cross-references from the lookup at the 'Send to:' prompt. 
 This ensures that if the user enters a number, it cannot partial match  (and
 display) an SSN.  Lookup on the ^VA(200 is now confined to the following
 cross references:  NAME(B), ALIAS(BB), INITIAL(C), NICK NAME(D) 

NOIS: ALB-0596-50002      Routines: ^XMRENT
 Prevents an error from occuring when the SENDER field (piece 4) of a message
 is zero.

NOIS: DAY-1096-41059      Routines: ^XMGAPI0
 If a message subject is longer than 65 characters, it is truncated to the
 first 250 characters.

NOIS: ANN-1096-41381      Routines: ^XMRPCTS0
 Check to make sure a task is running, rather than just assuming it is.

NOIS: WPB-0894-30125      Routine: ^XMA1
 The default message action for a message which is NEWed is IGNORE, even if
 the site or the user has specified that the default message action is
 DELETE.  If a user deletes a message after NEWing it, the message will be
 deleted.  The default is changed only for the duration of your actions on
 that particular message.  When you get to the next message, your default is
 whatever it is supposed to be.

  1.  These routines are usually mapped on systems that allow mapping,
      so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routines.
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
  4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
         2 Verify Checksums in Transport Global
         3 Print Transport Global
         4 Compare Transport Global to Current System
         5 Backup a Transport Global
         6 Install Package(s)
  5.  MSM Sites - Answer YES to the question 'Want to MOVE routines to
      other CPUs?'. Enter the names of your Compute and Print server(s).
  6.  AXP Sites, after patch has installed, rebuild your map set.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
We recommend that you run option XMAUTOPURGE daily to purge your system of
unreferenced messages.  It runs approximately 40 minutes per 100,000 messages.
Your mileage may vary.

Option XMSTAT will show you the results of the last 20 purges: purge type,
when they were run and how long they took, and how many messages were purged.

MailMan patch XM*7.1*37 contains the following enhancements and bug fixes:

NOIS:  LAK-0396-31177
Rtns:  ^XMA32,^XMA32A
These "date purge" routines have been changed to
- improve efficiency
- make the coding clearer
- recognize more internet date formats
- purge messages which think they are responses but really aren't
- purge responses which think they are original messages but really aren't
- recognize and comply with a task stop request

NOIS:  NYN-0996-10302
Rtns:  ^XMA3
DD:    file 4.3, field #4.304, 'MESSAGES NOT TO PURGE WEEKDAYS'
Makes the documentation in the routine and DD match the code in the routine.

NOIS:  MIN-0195-40075
Rtns:  ^XMA3,^XMA30,^XMA31
Make sure that messages within the no-purge-days buffer aren't deleted.

NOIS:  WBP-0996-22202
Rtns:  ^XMA3,^XMA30,^XMA31
DD:    file 4.3, new field #142, 'NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER'
Lets the site specify the no-purge number of days.
Routines are modified to improve efficiency and clarity.

              DESCRIPTION:      This field is used during the
                                un-referenced-messages purge to avoid purging
                                the last few messages in the message file,
                                according to their send date.
                                We subtract the NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER from
                                today's date, giving a 'no-purge date'.  Local
                                messages which were created on or after that
                                date are not subject to purge.  Messages from
                                other sites are not affected by this buffer.  
                                If this field is not filled in, it defaults to
                                7 days.  One day is probably all that is
                                needed, however.  
                                One situation in which this buffer may be
                                useful is in the case of a message sent only to
                                a remote site.  Such a message is unreferenced
                                and would otherwise be subject to purge.  If a
                                reply came from the remote site after the
                                original message had been purged, the sender
                                would have access only to the reply and not to
                                the original message.  The NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER
                                could be set to a reasonable number of days to
                                allow for a reply.

NOIS:  WBP-0596-21011

Delete Server messages from Postmaster's Mailbox after processing them.

NOIS:  MCM-1295-51144
Rtns:  ^XMA3
While cleaning out Postmaster's ARRIVING basket, deletes any message which
is still arriving after 'NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER' number of days.

NOIS:  None
Rtns:  ^XMADJF1B,^XMYPOST7
This problem was revealed during testing of this patch.  MailMan does not
use FileMan to add messages to a user's basket; he does it himself, and that
includes updating the zero node.  Up 'til now, when MM delivered a message to
a user's basket, he put the message number (not the number of messages) into
piece 4 of the zero node of the message multiple.  This patch corrects that
mistake.  ^XMYPOST7 goes through all message multiples of everyone's mailbox
and corrects the message multiple zero nodes.

NOIS:  DAY-0196-41801
Rtns:  ^XMA30
The user status report now includes 'last sign on', as well as 'last mail use'.

===========================================================================
This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
minimum.  You should put the XMUSER Option out of order.  No one should be
using MailMan.  The filers (mail delivery tasks) should not be running.

The post-install routine, ^XMYPOST7, will run about 3 minutes per
1000 mailboxes.  See the description above about what it will be doing.
*NOTE*:  It will try to lock ^XMB(3.7).  If it cannot lock it, it will not
run, and you will have to run it manually at a future time.  So if you see
that ^XMYPOST7 stopped running as soon as it started, then you know it could
not get a lock. 

^XMYPOST8 will not run.  Do not run it.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This MailMan patch is in response to a problem noted on FORUM.
 
A description of the problem:
Site A (from outside the VA) sends a message to Site B (in the VA).
User at Site B forwards the message to Site C (in the VA).
Site C has records in ^XMBX(4.501 (do not accept messages from domains
which match).
Site C rejects the message because the originating domain (Site A)
partial-matches the 'do not accept' record.
MailMan sends a message to Site A about the rejection.
MailMan keeps trying to forward the message from Site B to Site C
and keeps sending rejection messages to Site A, ad infinitum, ad nauseum.
MailMan does not notify the user at Site B who forwarded the message.
 
This patch does two things:
1. Sends the reject message to the user who forwarded the message.
2. Changes the status of the message so that MailMan does not attempt to
send it again.

if set to 0 will not allow self-enrollment in a group; 1 will allow.

Replace the description of $$MG^XMBGRP on page 31 of the Programmer Reference
Manual with the following: 

============================================================================
$$MG^XMBGRP

This extrinsic function is used to create a new mail group or to add members
to an existing mail group.  Only local users may be enrolled as members with
this function.

Usage:  S X=$$MG^XMBGRP(A,B,C,D,.E,.F,G)

(B,C,D,.F are ignored if the mail group previously exists.)

If successful, X will have the value of the mail group internal entry number.
If unsuccessful, X will be zero.

Where:

A =Mail group name (if new group)
   Mail group internal entry number (if existing group)
B =Mail group type flag (0=public; 1=private)
C =DUZ of organizer (.5=Postmaster assumed, if 0 passed)
D =Self enrollment allowed flag (0=no; 1=yes)
.E=Array of members to be enrolled.
   Members must be local users.
   Array must consist of DUZ's only; not names.
   E(n)="", where n is the member's DUZ.
.F=Mail group description array.
   F(1)="first line"
   F(2)="second line"
   etc.
G =Silent flag (0=interactive; 1=silent)

                               file 4.3, field 143 (new)

MailMan, with this patch, is now able to fax messages.  Currently, only FORUM
(to my knowledge) is able to take advantage of this new capability, which
requires the presence of the AKF* suite of fax software and files and fax
capability.  The site manager should indicate whether or not the site is
fax-enabled by setting the new field #143 in file 4.3 (default is "no"). 

Two new mail group multiples have been added to the Mail Group file:  Fax
Recipient, and Fax Group.  These multiples point to associated files in the fax
(AKF*) suite.  These files (^AKF("FAXR", Fax Rolodex, and ^AKF("FAXG", Fax
Group) must be populated through the fax suite.  LAYGO through MailMan is not
permitted. 

When a mail message is sent (or forwarded) to a mail group with these fax
multiples populated, the message is also transferred to the fax suite, and a
task is queued to fax the message to those recipients pointed to by the group. 

Fax recipients are faxed only the original message.  Replies to mail messages
are not faxed. Replies are not delivered as e-mail to fax recipients, unless
they are also on the message as "normal" recipients. 

MailMan faxes do not have a cover page.  They print in much the same way as a
message is printed on a printer. 

Individual fax recipients are stored in the recipient multiple of the message
(identified as F.&lt;fax recipient&gt;).  A "Query" of the message will reveal that
the message was sent to the Mail Group.  A "Query Detail" will reveal fax
recipients, when the message was transferred to the fax suite, and the fax ID
assigned to it by the fax suite, but will not reveal the transmission status. 
(The user can ascertain the transmission status via the fax suite and the fax
ID.) 

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
NOT INCLUDED in this patch is:
1) a necessary change to ^AKFAX to enable it to
recognize a MailMan Fax so that it can suppress the cover page for MailMan
faxes and address the fax to the recipient ("MailMan Fax for ... ").
2) a new field in file #589500 - ^AKF("FAX", FAX TRANSMISSION FILE
589500,3    MAILMAN FAX       0;4 SET OF CODES
                              '0' FOR NO;
                              '1' FOR YES;
            HELP-PROMPT:      Is this a MailMan-generated fax?
            DESCRIPTION:      Routine ^AKFAX checks this field to see if the
                              fax is a MailMan generated fax.  If it is, then
                              1) the fax cover sheet is suppressed and
                              2) two additional lines are added to the top of
                              the fax, identifying the recipient and the fax ID.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

            HELP-PROMPT:      Is your site fax enabled? 
            DESCRIPTION:      Your site is fax enabled if you have the suite
                              of fax software and files (^AKF) and fax
                              capability and you choose to allow faxes to be
                              sent via MailMan.  
                              To send faxes via MailMan, Mail groups (file
                              3.8) must first be populated in the fax
                              recipient and fax group multiples.  Then, when
                              a user sends a message to a mail group, the
                              message is also faxed to any fax recipients in
                              that mail group.
                              Responses to the message are not faxed.

===========================================================================

 This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
 minimum.  You should put the XMUSER Option out of order and shut down
 mail delivery tasks.  A cross reference ("F", on FORWARDING ADDRESS) is
 being added to the MAIL BOX file, and a lock must be placed on the whole
 global for the duration of the indexing.  If the lock cannot be obtained,
 the indexing of the new cross reference will not run.  If the indexing does
 not run, you can do it later by running ^XMYPOST6 yourself.  ^XMYPOST6
 will take about 1 minute per 2500 users in the ^XMB(3.7 global.
===========================================================================
 
INSTALLATION:
  1.  This routine is usually mapped on systems that allow mapping,
      so you will need to disable mapping for the effected routine.
  2.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  3.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
  4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System

Test Sites: Fort Meade, Brockton
When a user deletes a mail group, references to it from other mail groups
are not deleted.  When a user gets help on a mail group which has a
non-existent mail group as a member, MailMan bombs.  This patch will keep
MailMan from bombing and will delete non-existent mail group references
during mail group inquiry.

Test Site:  Togus, ME
When using the 'user information' option, in the list showing users for whom
the user may act as surrogate, the first user in the list shows
'no privileges', no matter which privileges have been granted.
This patch fixes that bug.

This user may act as surrogate for:

MailMan patch XM*7.1*40 contains the following enhancements:

NOIS:       MCM-0197-51792
Rtns:       ^XMA1,^XMJMQ,^XMJMQ1,^XMJMP1,^XMXUTIL,^XMYPRE1
DD:         file 3.9, field .01 of RECIPIENT multiple - adds "C" xref to DD
Test Site:  Miles City,MT; Bronx,NY
Improves the query (Q,QD,QN,Q name) function:
1) makes coding clearer
2) makes 'Q name' perform more like a FileMan lookup for local addressees
   a) recognizes partial last name, partial first name for the first time ever
   b) query by addressee's DUZ for the first time ever
   c) query by addressee's nickname for the first time ever
3) enables 'Q name' to work on remote addressees for the first time ever!
   a) recognizes partial last name
   b) recognizes partial last name, partial first name
   c) recognizes partial last name, partial domain
   d) (does not work with I: or CC: remote addressees)
4) enables 'Q name' to work on devices and servers (D. and S.) for the first
   time ever
3) improves display aesthetics

The following concerns the RECIPIENT multiple of the MESSAGE file:
The "C" cross reference data has always existed for the .01 field (RECIPIENT).
But... the DD has the "C" xref on field 1 (LAST RESPONSE READ).
So... We switch the xref in the DD from field 1 to field .01. as follows:
Routine XMYPRE1 deletes the "C" xref on field 1 (LAST RESPONSE READ).
The partial DD in this patch sets the "C" xref on field .01 (RECIPIENT).
Since the actual "C" xref data has always been on field .01, we don't need
to do anything with the "C" xref data - just leave it alone.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
MailMan patch XM*7.1*44 contains the following enhancements:

NOIS:       OKL-0497-70538
E3R:        9173,9994
Rtns:       ^XMA32A,^XMADJF1,^XMGAPI3,^XMZTERM,^XMZTERM1
Options:    XMMGR,XMMGR-TERMINATE-ONE,XMMGR-TERMINATE-MANY,
            XMMGR-TERMINATE-SUGGEST,XMMGR-PURGE-MESSAGE
Test Sites: Oklahoma City, OK; Prescott, AZ; St. Louis, MO; Houston, TX

Broadcast mail is now delivered only to users who have an access code, a verify
code, a primary menu, and a mail box.

Four new options have been added to XMMGR-DISK-SPACE-MANAGEMENT menu:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME: XMMGR-PURGE-MESSAGE               MENU TEXT: Purge a message
DESCRIPTION:  This option enables you to purge any message.

Purge means:
-delete the message from all user mailboxes
-delete the message from the MESSAGE global ^XMB(3.9
-delete all responses from the MESSAGE global ^XMB(3.9

Purge is not reversible.  The message is gone forever.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME: XMMGR-TERMINATE-ONE               MENU TEXT: Terminate one mail user
DESCRIPTION:   This option lets you remove the mailbox of any user
who meets the criteria of either the XMMGR-TERMINATE-MANY option or the
XMMGR-TERMINATE-SUGGEST option.
As a result, the user will not receive any mail.  

Remember,
-Whenever you give a user a new access code,
 the system gives the user a mailbox if he doesn't already have one.
-Whenever a user logs on,
 the system gives the user a mailbox if he doesn't already have one.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME: XMMGR-TERMINATE-MANY              MENU TEXT: Terminate many mail users
DESCRIPTION:   This option goes through the MAIL BOX global and removes any
mailbox if
- the user is not in the NEW PERSON file.
- the user has no access code and was not terminated.
- the user has no access code and was terminated w/o mailbox retention.
- the user has an access code and primary menu, but no verify code, AND 
  - has never signed on, since being added before a cutoff date.  
  OR 
  - last signed on before a cutoff date.

Remove means:
- Delete user's private mail groups
- Remove user from membership in all groups
- Remove user as an authorized sender from all groups 
- Remove user from anyone's list of surrogates
- Delete user's latered-messages list
- Delete user's mail box
As a result, the user will not receive any mail.

This option can be run in 'test' or 'real' mode.  

The report lists, in DUZ order:
-The user's DUZ and name
-Whether the user has an access code, verify code, and primary menu
-When the user was added to the NEW PERSON file
-When the user last signed on
-When the user was terminated (if applicable)
-If the user was terminated, then whether the site manager chose to delete
 the user's mailbox.  (It's generally a good idea to go ahead and delete
 the mailbox upon termination.) 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME: XMMGR-TERMINATE-SUGGEST
MENU TEXT: Terminate mail user suggestions
DESCRIPTION:   This option goes through the MailBox global and reports on
users who perhaps should have their mail access terminated.  

Users are included in the report if
- the user was terminated before a manager-supplied cutoff date
  and allowed to keep a mailbox.
- the user has an access code, verify code, and primary menu,
  but last signed on before a manager-supplied cutoff date.  

This option does not terminate mail access.  

The report page breaks on Service/Section and includes the following 
information: 
-User's DUZ and name
-Whether the user has an access code, a verify code, and a primary menu
-When the user last signed on
-When the user was terminated (if applicable)
-If the user was terminated, then whether the site manager chose
 to delete the user's mailbox.  (Remember, you should usually answer 'yes'
 to this question, unless the user is coming back and needs to have his mail
 retained.)
-How many new messages the user has.  (New messages are never purged, except 
 during purge-by-date purges.) 

Finally there are two blank columns.  One is headed "Term User Mbox"
(Terminate user mailbox), and the other is headed "Deact VISTA Access"
(Deactivate VISTA Access).  Besides being of interest to the Site Manager,
this report is also designed to be submitted to other services. The intent is
that the other services would check one of the columns for each user in the
report and return the report to the Site Manager to act on. 

===========================================================================

      OpenM-NT = Dec ALPHA or PC running OpenM NextGen 2.0 or Cache on NT.
 
INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
AXP:  Some of these routines might be mapped, so you will need to disable
      mapping for the affected routines.
 
MSM-NT: Where TCP/IP Mail is running, kill the Mail listener. In the Manager
      account D ^KILLJOB and kill the job who's routine name is XMRINETD.
 
OpenM-NT: Where TCP/IP Mail is running, kill the Mail listener.  In the
      Manager account D ^RESJOB and kill the job who's routine name is XMRONT
      or it may be %ZISTCP, in either case it will own device |TCP|25.
 
  1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS Distribution onto your system.
  2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the patch in the Transport
      global.
  3.  Users can remain on the system. This patch can be queued and installed
      at any time.  TaskMan can remain running.
  4.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
         2  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
         3  Print Transport Global

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
MailMan patch XM*7.1*59 addresses problems caused during remote transmission
when a message's 'from' address contains illegal characters.

This patch only addresses locally originating messages which are sent to
remote sites.

As the message is being transmitted to the remote site, MailMan examines
the 'from' string.
If the 'from' string is enclosed in "&lt;&gt;", the "&lt;&gt;" are stripped off.
If the 'from' string contains illegal characters, the 'from' string will be
enclosed in quotes.

The local site will not see the change in the 'from' string.
The receiving site will see the change.

For example:

'National Patch Module'     will become     '"National Patch Module"'
'&lt;Patient Feedback Pkg&gt;'    will become     '"Patient Feedback Pkg"'

Messages from users will continue to be treated as usual.  That is, if the
user's name contains ',' or ' ', all ', .' will become '._+'.
If the user's name contains any other illegal characters, such as '()',
the entire user's name will be enclosed in quotes.

===========================================================================
This patch should be installed after-hours, when user activity is at a
minimum.  You should put the XMUSER option out of order. The filers should
be shut down.

    the patch into a Transport Global on your system.  
3.  On the KIDS:Installation menu, use the following options to install the 
    Transport Global: 
       Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
       Print Transport Global 
       Compare Transport Global to Current System 
       Backup a Transport Global 
       Install Package(s)

MailMan patch XM*7.1*65 addresses a problem experienced on FORUM.

Someone from a remote site sent a message to G.EVERYBODY@FORUM.  This group
is used to broadcast messages VA-wide.  There are four authorized senders
for the group, one of which is POSTMASTER.  The background job which receives
messages from remote sites has its XMDUZ set to .5, which is the POSTMASTER.
So MailMan considered this remote sender to be authorized to address the
group.  This is not acceptable.

This patch adds a restriction to addressing groups with authorized senders,
namely, remote senders cannot send mail to such groups.

===========================================================================
This patch should be installed after-hours, when user activity is at a
minimum.  You should put the XMUSER option out of order. The filers should
be shut down.
===========================================================================

INSTALLATION:
1.  DSM Sites: If any of these routines is mapped, disable mapping for the 
    affected routine(s).  
2.  On the PackMan menu, use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option.  This loads

MailMan patch XM*7.1*67 adds a new key, 'XM NO BROADCASTS',
in response to an Initial Requirements Analysis (IRA):
"MailMan - Screen Out Selected Users".
Coincidentally, it also fulfills the suggestion of E3R 10653.
This patch was tested at Wilkes-Barre, PA.

Any user possessing the key 'XM NO BROADCASTS'
will NOT receive ANY broadcast messages.

This IRA was initiated because users with accounts in multiple sites were
seeing the same broadcast message everywhere they logged on.  These users
wanted a way to avoid broadcast messages.

When and if you assign this key to a user, you should advise them that
they will not see any broadcast messages at all.

This patch also deletes two keys which are not used by MailMan:
XMPRIORITY and XMPRIORITY-OVERRIDE

Note: This patch may be installed at any time.

MailMan patch XM*7.1*69 fixes a bug as described in NOIS ISH-0199-40487.
Test site:  CIOFO-HINES.

Under certain conditions, a message which is in the process of arriving
from another site may be deleted from the Postmaster's ARRIVING basket,
thus preventing it from being delivered, and causing it to eventually be
purged from the system.  This patch fixes this problem.

Note: This patch may be installed at any time.

Patch XM*7.1*50.  The BIG patch!  It is important that you read this patch
description and follow the install instructions.

Test Sites:  DOMAIN.EXT; GATEWAY.DOMAIN.EXT; Indianapolis, IN;
             Montana HCS, MT; San Francisco, CA; SAIC Corp.;
             German Heart Institute, Berlin, Germany; San Francisco CIOFO

The changes included in this patch are so extensive, that several of the
MailMan manuals have been rewritten.  The full patch description and the
new manuals are in PDF documents on the infrastructure web site at:
http://www.vista.domain.ext/
softserv/infrastr.uct/notebook/active/xm_patch_50_notebook.htm
- XM*7.1*50 Patch Description
- MailMan V.7.1 &amp; XM*7.1*50 Release Notes
- MailMan V.7.1 &amp; XM*7.1*50 Getting Started
- MailMan V.7.1 &amp; XM*7.1*50 User Manual
- MailMan V.7.1 &amp; XM*7.1*50 Programmer Manual
- MailMan V.7.1 &amp; XM*7.1*50 Technical Manual

Highlights of the patch:
- Addresses 54 distinct NOIS and 40 distinct E3R.
- For those sites requesting it, performs, along with follow-on patch
  XM*7.1*51, automatic domain name change from .DOMAIN.EXT to .DOMAIN.EXT, as
  well as domain rename. This patch adds the new domain names as synonyms to
  the current domain names.  XM*7.1*51 will actually change the domain names.
  (XM*7.1*51 will be released after all sites have installed XM*7.1*50.)
- Adds many new APIs.
- Replaces the old user help frames with an entire new set of help frames.
  (The IRM help frames have not been updated.)
- Makes many changes to the MailMan DDs.
- Renames file 3.7 from MAIL BOX to MAILBOX.
- Renames file 4.3 from KERNEL SITE PARAMETERS to MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS.
- Improves global integrity checker.
- Improves message search.
- Insists that users must have a mailbox and an access code in order to
  receive messages.  This is to ensure that messages do not accumulate in
  inactive mailboxes, never to be deleted.  It is very important that any
  ficticious user be properly set up so that mail deliveries to these users
  are not stopped.
- Implements message filtering.
- Improves local message delivery system.
- Adds 'full screen' user interface for managing and reading messages.
- Rewrites 'classic' user interface to improve maintainability.
- Most ^XMA* routines have been superseded by other routines.
- (new) ^XMJ* routines comprise the user interface.
- (new) ^XMK* routines perform message posting.
- (new) ^XMT* routines perform message delivery.
- (new) ^XMX* routines comprise the APIs.
- (new) ^XMV* routines comprise user identity.
- ^XMR* has been rewritten.
- Improves the remote message xref, ^XMBX(3.9,"AI", by enabling it to handle
longer message IDs.  Specifically, the xref has changed
from: ^XMBX(3.9,"AI",site@msgid,xmz)=fm date/time
to:   ^XMBX(3.9,"AI",site,msgid,xmz)=fm date 
The post-init will reconfigure the xref.  (This could take anywhere from 1/2
hour to several hours, depending on how large the global is.)  Here's a tip:
You can cut down the time that this will take by running option
XMMGR-PURGE-AI-XREF (AI x-Ref Purge of Received Network Messages)
prior to installing this patch.  This will reduce the number of xrefs in the
AI xref global.
- Enables message number recycling.  To do this,
--A new field (17.1, MAX DIGITS FOR MESSAGE NUMBER) has been added to file
4.3, to let each site decide how large the numbers may get before they
recycle and start again (from 100000).  The post-init will set it to
the maximum length of your site's existing message numbers.  (If it's less
than 7, it will be set to 7.  If it's greater than 14, it will be set to 14.)
You may change it afterward.
--A new field (31, LOCAL CREATE DATE) has been added to file 3.9.  The post-
init will go through the file 3.9, populate the new field with the date
the message was sent, and create the new "C" xref.  (This will take about
1 hour per 200,000 messages.)  Here's a tip:
You can cut down the time that this will take by running option
XMPURGE-BY-DATE (Purge Messages by Origination Date)
and XMAUTOPURGE (Automatic Purge of MailMan Messages)
prior to installing this patch.  This will reduce the number of messages
in file 3.9.
--The message purge processes have been changed to operate off LOCAL
CREATE DATE.  The date purge routine is now much faster, since it has an
appropriate xref to work with.  The weekday unreferenced messages purge can
focus better and thus be more efficient.
--Other fields have changed their focus from message number to the LOCAL
CREATE DATE:
File 3.7, MailBox:
3.7,1.2   MESSAGE @ REINSTATEMENT becomes DATE @ REINSTATEMENT (The post-
init will change any existing message numbers in this field to their equiv-
alent dates.
File 4.3, MailMan Site Parameters:
4.3,4.301 NO-PURGE MESSAGES BUFFER becomes NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER (The post-
init will set this field to null, which defaults to 2 days.  You may change
it afterward.
4.302,3   FIRST MESSAGE TO PROCESS  becomes START PURGE DATE
4.302,4   LAST MESSAGE TO PROCESS   becomes STOP PURGE DATE
4.302,8   LAST MESSAGE PROCESSED    becomes LAST DATE PROCESSED
4.3,4.304 WEEKDAY MESSAGES TO PURGE becomes WEEKDAY DAYS TO PURGE (Any value
your site has in this field will be changed by the post-init from number of
messages to the equivalent number of days.  You may change it afterward.)
4.3,142   NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER      becomes NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER (LOCAL)

NOTES:
a. This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
minimum.  It should not be queued, because TaskMan should not be running.
b. This patch requires Kernel patches XU*8.0*67, XU*8.0*112, and XU*8.0*113.
c. For any site running MAS (all VAMCs), this patch requires FileMan patch
DI*22.0*1.  Caution: KIDS will not check for this patch because not all
sites run MAS.  It is up to each site running MAS to check for DI*22.0*1.
d. All MailMan users, including fictitious users, must have an access code,
or they will no longer receive mail.
e. To shorten installation time, which runs about 1 hour per 200,000 messages
in file 3.9, you might consider running the message purges the day before
the installation:
- XMMGR-PURGE-AI-XREF (AI x-Ref Purge of Received Network Messages)
- XMPURGE-BY-DATE (Purge Messages by Origination Date)
- XMAUTOPURGE (Automatic Purge of MailMan Messages)
f. DSM sites running SlotMaster may see routine mapping problems with ZSLOT
users, even after disabling mapping.  Therefore, such sites should consider
the following steps:
- Shutdown ZSLOT on all nodes.
- Disable all mapped XM routines.
- Load this patch.
- Enter manual edits.
- Rebuild mapped routine sets.
- Shutdown/restart all DSM configurations.
An alternative to the above steps is to disable all mapped XM routines about
a week before you load this patch.  That way you wouldn't need to shutdown
ZSLOT or shutdown/restart DSM configurations.
g. If your site is running POP3, you should immediately load patch XM*7.1*71
after installing this patch.

INSTALLATION:

NOTES:
a. This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
minimum.  It should not be queued, because TaskMan should not be running.
b. This patch requires Kernel patches XU*8.0*67, XU*8.0*112, and XU*8.0*113.
c. For any site running MAS (all VAMCs), this patch requires FileMan patch
DI*22.0*1.  Caution: KIDS will not check for this patch because not all
sites run MAS.  It is up to each site running MAS to check for DI*22.0*1.
d. All MailMan users, including fictitious users, must have an access code,
or they will no longer receive mail.
e. To shorten installation time, which runs about 1 hour per 200,000 messages
in file 3.9, you might consider running the message purges the day before
the installation:
- XMMGR-PURGE-AI-XREF (AI x-Ref Purge of Received Network Messages)
- XMPURGE-BY-DATE (Purge Messages by Origination Date)
- XMAUTOPURGE (Automatic Purge of MailMan Messages)
f. DSM sites running SlotMaster may see routine mapping problems with ZSLOT
users, even after disabling mapping.  Therefore, such sites should consider
the following steps:
- Shutdown ZSLOT on all nodes.
- Disable all mapped XM routines.
- Load this patch.
- Enter manual edits.
- Rebuild mapped routine sets.
- Shutdown/restart all DSM c nfigurations.
An alternative to the above steps is to disable all mapped XM routines about
a week before you load this patch.  That way you wouldn't need to shutdown
ZSLOT or shutdown/restart DSM configurations.
g. If your site is running POP3, you should immediately load patch XM*7.1*71
after installing this patch.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. This patch replaces routine ^XMRPCTS1, which contains your site's TWIX
   routing info.  Before you install this patch, copy the current TWIX info
   from that routine at your site.  After you install this patch, edit
   the new ^XMRPCTS1 to set your site's current TWIX info.  Specifically:
XMRPCTS1     ;(KC-VAMC)/XXX-Simple PCTS front end to MailMan ;03/19/98  11:10

     ;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
     ;All should be sent to XXX@VHA.DMIA the local PCTS Domain
     ;Edit these for your site.               &lt;---Copy your site's TWIX info
     S XMUS="XXXX" ;Local routing indicator   &lt;---from this line

     I XMUS="XXXX"!(XMFM="YYYY") S %="FIX Routing codes !!!"_XMPCTS0("ERR")
     ;-------------------------------------------------------------
2.  The TIME ZONE field in file 4.3 must have your site's time zone in it.
    Please check and ensure that it is there.
3.  DSM SITES: Disable all mapped XM routines.  In step 13, we'll rebuild
    the map set with *different* routines, because many have become obsolete.
4.  On the PackMan menu, use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option to load
    the patch into a transport global.
5.  On the Manage MailMan:Local Delivery Management menu, use the following
    option to stop the background filer:
       STOP background filer (XMAD)
Are you sure you want the BACKGROUND FILERS to STOP delivering mail NO// YES
                                                                         ===
&lt;&lt;&lt; Mail Deliveries will stop momentarily. &gt;&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;   Background filer will stop before delivering the next message !!! &gt;&gt;&gt;
6.  Stop TaskMan.  You may also wish to shut down HL7 filers/LLP's and other
    background tasks which may attempt to create new messages.
7.  Place option XMUSER out of order.  (We do it ourselves, instead of letting
KIDS do it, because we're going to place XMUSER back in order during the
post-init.)  To place XMUSER out of order, enter FileMan, and:

13. DSM SITES: After patch has installed, rebuild your map set.
    Many routines have become obsolete and should be removed from the map
    set.  Here is a new recommended list of routines to map, should your
    site choose to map routines:
    Minimum                           Additional
    -------                           ----------

14. This patch replaces routine ^XMRPCTS1, which contains your site's TWIX
    routing info.  In step 1, you copied the TWIX info for your site from
    that routine.  Now, edit the new ^XMRPCTS1 to set your site's TWIX info.
    Specifically:

     ;-------------------------------------------------------------
15. For those sites using class III ^ASKX820, you should edit routine
^ASKX820.  It calls ENT^XMAD1, an illegal entry point which no longer exists.
Replace it with a call to ENT1^XMD.
16. For those sites running class III WordManager, you will have to find the
    WordManager routine containing D OK^XMA22.  For version 5.01, it's in
    routine ^WMWTWM.  It may be in other routines in other versions.
    OK^XMA22 is an undocumented entry point into MailMan which no longer
    exists.  Edit the WordManager routine as follows:
Replace:

17. For those sites using class III ^BJMAIL*, you should edit routine ^BJMAIL
to correct its egregious violations of the SAC.  If you don't, MailMan will
will not function properly.  Once you have edited ^BJMAIL, you may delete
routine ^BJMAIL1, since it will no longer be used.  Edit ^BJMAIL as follows:
Replace:
MSG    Q:'$D(T)
  ... thru ...
WRITE  ;Write a message - not part of the main program.
With:

        N XMINSTR

have its new name added as a synonym.  (Error messages are preceded by ***,
and tell you what was wrong.)  You must correct the error manually and add
the synonym manually.  Remember, you are not to change any domain name.
Just add the new name as a synonym.

Patch XM*7.1*71

Test Site:  DOMAIN.EXT

In response to E3R #10591, and management directive,
this patch raises the class III POP3 server routines to class I,
and incorporates them into MailMan.

NOTE: This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*50.

Class III routines ^XMRPOPA, ^XMRPOPB, and ^XMRPOPC are replaced by class I
routine ^XMRPOP.  These class III routines should be deleted after the
install.

Class III routine ^XMUCXPOP becomes Class I.  Even though you may already
have it on your system, this patch treats it as a new routine, because it is
new to MailMan.

Patch XM*7.1*75

Test Site:  Montana HCS

When you read a message at your terminal, every time the screen fills up,
MailMan pauses the display until you press return to continue.  
When you print a message or messages to a terminal, MailMan's behavior does
not make much sense.

This patch establishes what happens when you print to the terminal. 

 A. If you print a message from the "Message Action: Ignore//" prompt,
    MailMan will not pause at all.
 B. If you print a message or messages from the Classic-mode message list,
    MailMan will not pause at all.
 C. If you print a message(s) from the Detailed-mode or Summary-mode,
    Mailman will pause just before giving the message list again.

NOTE: This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*50.

Patch XM*7.1*81

NOIS: ASH-0899-30768

As you know, IDCU is no longer with us.
It is necessary to delete all IDCU scripts from the DOMAIN file.
In examining the scripts, it appears that all IDCU scripts are
named SCRIPT.  Therefore, the pre-init in this patch is designed
to go through all the transmission scripts in the DOMAIN file
and delete all of the ones named SCRIPT.

You may let MailMan delete the scripts, or you may do it yourself.
You may wish to make a backup of the DOMAIN file before deleting
the scripts.  A pre-install question will ask you what you want to
do.  If you choose to let MailMan delete the scripts, the
pre-init will go ahead and delete them.  Otherwise, the pre-init
will not run, and you should go through the DOMAIN file yourself
and delete all IDCU scripts.

NOTE: This patch may be installed at any time.

 Install Questions for XM*7.1*81

 Do you want me to delete all scripts named SCRIPT? YES// &lt;it's up to you!&gt;
Answer YES or NO here.  If you answer YES, the pre-init will run and will
delete all scripts named SCRIPT.  (It will also let you know if, after
deleting any scripts, a domain is left without any transmission scripts.)
If you answer NO, the pre-init will stop without doing anything, and you must
go through the DOMAIN file yourself and delete all IDCU scripts. 

 Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? YES// NO
                                                                       ==

Patch XM*7.1*83

NOIS: ISW-0899-22203
Test Site:  CIOFO-ALBANY &amp; CIOFO-WASHINGTON

If you send a message to "LASTNAME,FIRST@DOMAIN", it gets there.
If you send a message to "LAS,FIRS@DOMAIN", you get "addressee not found".
An unintended consequence of patch XM*7.1*50 was that lookups using comma
piecing stopped working for message sent to remote sites.
This patch restores such lookups.

Patch XM*7.1*93

NOIS:  KAN-0999-40493
Test Site:  Kansas City, MO

There seem to be some bogus cross references left over from previous
incarnations of MailMan.

The only official whole-file cross references on the MESSAGE file are what
you see below. If you see others, they are either bogus or they are local
modifications.  This patch shows you and deletes the known bogus cross
references.  If you see other cross references, and are unsure whether they
are bogus or whether they are local modifications, please log a NOIS.
Do not delete anything without consulting Customer Service.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
If your site is pre-patch XM*7.1*50, this is what you should see when you

Patch XM*7.1*85

NOIS: TAM-0899-32035
Test Site:  Tampa, FL

If a message looks as if it's from a remote site (piece 2 of the zero node
contains "@"), but it's really a local message, MailMan aborts trying to
figure out who it's from.  This patch prevents MailMan from aborting.

NOTE: This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*50.

Patch XM*7.1*89

NOIS:  MON-0999-50325, MON-0999-50323
Test Site:  Montana HCS

This patch fixes several problems:
1. If a message is forwarded to * (broadcast to all users), the message
now becomes 'information only'.  It didn't used to.
2. If a broadcast message has responses, and a user reads the message, the
user is told 'you haven't read response x', whether the user read response
x or not.  The user won't be pestered about response x any more.
3. If a message is sent to FRED@ANOTHERSITE, and then later forwarded to
FRED at this site, Q does not show FRED; only QD does.

NOTE: This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*87.

Patch XM*7.1*77

NOIS:  BRX-0297-10955
Test Site:  Bronx

This patch ensures that duplicate members cannot be added to the
MEMBER multiple of the MAIL GROUP file. 

The pre-init for this patch checks the MEMBER multiple of the MAIL GROUP
file and deletes any duplicates.

The .01 field of the MEMBER multiple of the MAIL GROUP file is altered
as follows:
1. the "B" xref is converted from a traditional xref to a new index.
2. a uniqueness key is added.

NOTE: This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*50 and FileMan patch DI*22.0*12.

Patch XM*7.1*50 introduced a bug into WHO^XMA21.  When X is a group name,
XMY only contains the first member of the group.  This patch fixes that,
so that XMY contains all members of the group.

Patch XM*7.1*100

When acting as a surrogate, and printing new messages, a confidential
message sends MailMan into an endless loop.  This patch fixes that.

When printing several messages at once, if one of them is scrambled,
MailMan aborts.  This patch fixes that.

Patch XM*7.1*99

NOIS:  none
Test Site:  CIOFO-SAN FRANCISCO

The pre-init for MailMan patch XM*7.1*50 deleted unneeded fields from the
data dictionary and the globals.

To decide whether it should run (and to prevent it from running twice),
it checked for the presence of a global node (^XMBPOST("POST")).  Any
account in which anyone had ever sent a response would have had this node.
Some development accounts didn't have this node, so the pre-init did not
run.

This patch checks for the presence of a different node to determine whether
the pre-init should run.  If it ran in patch XM*7.1*50, it won't run again,
but if it didn't run in patch XM*7.1*50, it will run.

This patch also:
- resends the DDs for files 3.7, 3.9, 4.2999, and 4.3.  No changes are made
to the DDs.  We just want to ensure that sites have the full and correct DDs.

- corrects an incorrect patch list in the second line of routine ^XMXREPLY.
It changes 84 to 85.  (NOIS ISB-1099-30184: Patch XM*7.1*85 created an
incorrect patch list in routine ^XMXREPLY.)

- prevents an error message from being sent if a user up-arrows out of a
selection while addressing a group. 

NOTE: This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*85.

Test Site:  Amarillo, TX

Allow users to have a server option (S.xxx) as a forwarding address.
(Users may have remote addresses, as well as local devices and servers
as forwarding addresses.)

Allow forwarding of messages from remote postmasters if the forwarding
address is local.  (To avoid looping error messages, messages from remote
postmasters are not forwarded to remote addresses.)

FYI:
If a fictitious user is a member of a mail group, and the sole purpose of
that fictitious user is to have a forwarding address of a device,
the preferred method is to put the device directly in the mail group (in
the remote member multiple) and get rid of the fictitious user.

When minusing a user during message addressing, MailMan should limit the
choices to the current addressees, as it did before patch XM*7.1*50.
This patch restores that functionality.

NOTE: This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*96.

This patch fixes problems experienced in the PDX and DSS packages.
This patch removes the string length restriction for TCP/IP transmissions.
Note that the restriction is only removed at the sending site.
(At the receiving site, the restriction is unchanged.  If MailMan receives
a line over 255 characters, it chops it up into as many lines as needed.)

Patch XM*7.1*104

Y2K Waiver Exemption ID: WE0008

NOIS:  MAD-1099-41351
Test Site:  Madison, WI
Routines: ^XMXADDR, ^XMXADDR1, ^XMXADDRD
If a user enters an address, which is a device name or option name or remote
address which has exact, as well as partial matches in the DEVICE, OPTION, or
DOMAIN files, MailMan rightly asks the user to select one. 

If a mail group contains a device name or option name or remote address
which has exact, as well as partial matches, MailMan should automatically
select the exact match.  However, it doesn't.  This patch makes MailMan
select the exact match.

Also in this patch,
^XMDF     - Correct code which is never executed.
^XMGAPI3  - Prepare for name change from DOMAIN.EXT to DOMAIN.EXT
^XMJMD    - Correct how largest message number is obtained.
^XMVGROUP - If a site has faxing enabled, allow mail group edit options
            to edit fax multiples in mail group file.
^XMXADDR1 - Don't accept broadcast messages from remote sites.

NOTE: This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*101.

Y2K Waiver Exemption ID: Y2KWE0010

NOIS:  IVM-1099-31783, IVM-1099-33078
Test Site:  HEC, Atlanta, GA

There seems to be a problem with getting a lock sometimes, when attempting to
file a message into or delete a message from a basket.  This patch removes
MailMan's locks, and lets FileMan handle the locking.  If FileMan can't get
the lock, MailMan will keep calling Fileman until FileMan succeeds.

Also in this patch:
^XMXBSKT  - When resequencing messages in a basket, use local create date.
^XMXSEND  - Additional code to ensure message recycling functions correctly.

NOTE: This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*50.

A typo in routine ^XMUT2 caused the large message report to always start with
the first message in the message global, even if the user chose a different
message.  This patch fixes that.  This patch also changes the starting
parameter from message number to message date.  We're doing this because
message numbers can be recycled.

NOTE: This patch may be installed at any time.
It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*50.

Patch XM*7.1*107

Y2K Waiver Exemption ID: Y2KWE0024
This patch may be installed at any time during the Y2K Moratorium (including

NOIS: ANN-1199-42486

Circular relay domains create an allocation error.  MailMan now recognizes
when a domain has a relay domain, which has a relay domain, which... circles
back to itself.  MailMan lets the user know what's wrong.

Sometimes, when a user becomes a surrogate, his own (not the surrogate's)
messages are displayed.  This patch fixes that.

NOIS:  LAS-1299-60664
Test Site:  Las Vegas, NV
Message addressed to G.&lt;space&gt;@&lt;local site name&gt; invokes the space-bar recall
for mail group.  This "feature" is now disabled.

NOIS:  MAD-1299-42404
Test Site:  Madison, WI
Non-MailMan systems, such as MS Exchange, do not recognize I:&lt;recipient&gt;,
and return error messages when recipients are addressed as info-only.
MailMan now leaves off the "I:" when sending messages to info-only recipients
on non-MailMan systems.

NOIS: WAS-1199-20590, BRX-1199-10383
Test Sites: Washington, DC; Madison, WI; Bronx, NY
Sites have noticed sometimes, when becoming the Postmaster, MailMan informs
them that the last user to become the Postmaster was someone who is not a
valid Postmaster surrogate.  When a package sets XMDUZ=.5 and then sends a
message using ^XMD, MailMan records that use as "last used MailMan".  It
shouldn't.  This patch fixes that.

E3R:  12385
Test Site:  Tampa, FL; Albany, NY
This patch lets an authorized user send a limited broadcast message to a
subset of local users.  A subset might include all users who have a certain
primary menu or who belong to a certain division, or any other way that users
in the NEW PERSON file might be categorized.

Users authorized to send limited broadcasts are the POSTMASTER, any holder
of the XMSTAR key, and any holder of the new key, XMSTAR LIMITED.
The XMSTAR and XMSTAR LIMITED keys are mutually exclusive.

Limited broadcast types are predefined in the new LIMITED BROADCAST multiple
of file 4.3, the MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS file:
50        LIMITED BROADCAST (Multiple-4.32), [5;0]
          .01  LIMITED BROADCAST (MF), [0;1]
          1    POINTED TO FILE (RNJ9,3), [0;2]
          2    NEW PERSON FILE XREF (RF), [0;3]

The multiple will be loaded with 4 limited broadcasts by the post init:
LIMITED BROADCAST     POINTED TO FILE            NEW PERSON FILE XREF
-----------------     ----------------------     --------------------
DIVISION               4   (institution)         "AH"
KEY                   19.1 (security key)        "AB"
PRIMARY MENU          19   (option)              "AP"
SERVICE/SECTION       49   (service/section)     "E"

The cross references listed in the NEW PERSON FILE XREF field enable MailMan
to quickly identify the users who should receive the limited broadcast
messages.  In support of this patch, Kernel patch XU*8.0*135 adds a
new whole-file cross reference ("AH", on the DIVISION field) to the NEW
PERSON file.  This new cross reference enables a limited broadcast by DIVISION. 

You may add more limited broadcasts to the multiple, if you wish.

Using another new field in file 4.3, you may set a limited broadcast default
choice, which is displayed whenever someone goes to send a limited broadcast.
51        LIMITED BROADCAST DEFAULT, [0;20]
The post-init will set this field to DIVISION.  You may change it if you wish.

The option XMKSP Edit MailMan Site Parameters is updated to include the new
fields.

Additional fixes in this patch:
- MailMan now recognizes when a message has only 'latered' recipients.  When
forwarding or sending messages which have only 'latered' recipients, MailMan
did not recognize those recipients and issued an error message. This patch
corrects that. 

NOTE: This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
minimum.  It requires Kernel patch XU*8.0*135 and MailMan patches XM*7.1*74,
XM*7.1*94, XM*7.1*99, XM*7.1*102, XM*7.1*103, XM*7.1*104, XM*7.1*105,
and XM*7.1*106.

Patch XM*7.1*123

NOIS: PUG-0300-50243
Test Site:  Puget Sound HCS
Fix a string length error which occurs when receiving network mail.
A long sender string combined with a long subject can push a message's zero
node beyond 255 chars and cause the error.  This patch prevents that
error from occuring.

This patch also improves the background filer checker.  It tells you if
the background filers have been shut down, and how to restart them.

NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patches XM*7.1*107 and XM*7.1*112.

original message.  The command is "NS", and is available at the transmit
prompt when sending a new message.  It is also available when editing a
message sent only to oneself.  Help frames have been updated to include the
new command, and a new help frame, XM-U-M-NETWORK SIGNATURE, explains it.
New API: NETSIG^XMXEDIT
 
E3R 13400 - Upon return from ANSWER, COPY, or WRITE command, redisplay
message header to make it clear that you are back at original message. 
 
Additional enhancements:
- When editing a message the user has sent only to himself, the user may now
scramble or unscramble the message, and add his network signature to the
message, too.
- When answering a message, if the user doesn't have a network signature,
MailMan now asks the user if he would like to create one.
- Added entry and exit action to option XMEDITMG so that MailMan knows that
a user is interactively editing a mail group.
 
NOTE: This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
minimum.  It requires FileMan patch DI*22.0*17 and MailMan patches XM*7.1*72,
XM*7.1*79, XM*7.1*95, XM*7.1*100, XM*7.1*101, and XM*7.1*121.

Patch XM*7.1*124

NOIS: TAM-0400-30289
Test Site:  Tampa, FL
The API MOVEMSG^XMXAPI should not require XMK (basket number) when
XMZ (message IEN in MESSAGE file) is used to identify a message,
but it does.  This patch corrects that.

Patch XM*7.1*127

NOIS: REN-1099-63025
Test Site:  Reno, NV
If a message is queued to print later, and the user has chosen to print
a range of responses, which includes the last response, then when it comes
time to print the message, if more responses have since arrived, then
they'll be printed, too.

NOIS: REN-0300-62618
Test Site:  Reno, NV
Ensure that MailMan does not decrement new message counters below zero.

Thanks to additional test sites:
Puget Sound HCS

E3R 2731, 5983, 6044 - At the "Enter message action: IGNORE//" prompt, two
new actions have been added to let you access user and mail group help:
  HG   Help:Group Information
  HU   Help:User Information
Existing help frames have been updated.

E3R 3521 - At the "Enter message action: IGNORE//" prompt, a new
action has been added to let you easily print to the VA FileMan Browser:
  BR   Print to the Browser
Existing help frames have been updated, and a new help frame,
XM-U-M-BROWSER, has been created.

E3R 5451, 13225 - When filtering a message during message delivery to your
mailbox, you can now automatically set the message vaporize date.  You can
also specify that the message should not be made new.  You can set these
new fields under Personal Preferences:Message Filter Edit.
This will only apply to new messages which you have not seen before.  It
won't apply to responses or forwarded messages with responses. It won't
apply when you filter messages which are already in your mailbox. 
A new help frame, XM-U-P-FILTER ACTIONS, has been added, and existing help
frames have been updated.

E3R 5100, 13891 - When addressing a message, if an addressee is not found in
the local user file, MailMan now asks "Do you want to check the REMOTE USER
DIRECTORY? No//".  Also, if we do check it and find an entry, MailMan now
asks "OK?", instead of simply selecting it.  This should prevent unwanted
addressees, because the REMOTE USER DIRECTORY entry might not be what the
sender wants.

E3R 6861 - If a user has read all the responses of a message, then when he
goes to read the message, only the message header is displayed, followed by
the "Enter message action: IGNORE//" prompt.  Inexperienced users may not
know to enter 'B' to Backup.  MailMan now gives the following information:
"You are at the end of this message.  Enter 'B' to Backup and review it."

E3R 13475 - When showing information about a mail group
(option XMHELPGROUP), in addition to showing member groups, also show
groups to which the group belongs (Is a member group of:)
To accomplish this, a whole-file cross reference, "AD", is added to the
.01 field (MEMBER GROUP NAME) of the MEMBER GROUP multiple of file 3.8.
The post-init, which comes with this patch, will populate the xref.
Existing help frames have been updated.

Additionally:

- The "RI" (Reply and include responses) command now has a new capability to
let you include responses from another message. This capability is also
available when creating a new message ("IM" Include Message).
A new help frame, XM-U-M-INCLUDE MESSAGE, has been added, and existing help
frames updated.

- The SCRAMBLE^XMXEDIT API now checks to ensure that the key and hint
conform to the limitations set by the data dictionary.

- Those APIs which return error text
in ^TMP("XMERR",$J,&lt;error number&gt;,"TEXT",i), now also
return, for errors whose text is in the DIALOG file:
^TMP("XMERR",$J,&lt;error number&gt;)=&lt;dialog file ien&gt;
^TMP("XMERR",$J,"E",&lt;dialog file ien&gt;,&lt;error number&gt;)=""
and, for a very small subset of errors,
if something is wrong with one of the input parameters:
^TMP("XMERR",$J,&lt;error number&gt;,"PARAM","ID")=&lt;parameter name&gt;
^TMP("XMERR",$J,&lt;error number&gt;,"PARAM","VALUE")=&lt;parameter value&gt;

Patch XM*7.1*130

NOIS: MON-1099-51059, HOU-0100-72381
Test Site: Montana HCS
When creating a PackMan message, and you decide to abort it while selecting
recipients, MailMan ignores you and continues on.  MailMan has now been
taught to listen better.

E3R: 3029, 6336, 7402
Test Site: Bronx, NY
Allow anyone to forward a priority message to a mail group, if the site
so chooses.  A new field has been added to file 4.3, MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS,
and option XMKSP, MailMan Site Parameters, has been updated to include it.
Here's the new field:

STANDARD DATA DICTIONARY #4.3 -- MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS FILE
STORED IN ^XMB(1,  (1 ENTRY)
DATA     NAME                  GLOBAL        DATA
ELEMENT  TITLE                 LOCATION      TYPE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3,21   FORWARD PRIORITY MAIL TO GROUP 2;1 SET

                           '0' FOR NO; 
                           '1' FOR YES; 
         HELP-PROMPT:      Let users forward priority messages to mail
                           groups? 
         DESCRIPTION:      Enter YES is you wish to allow users to forward
                           priority messages to mail groups.  
  
                           Enter NO if you don't.  (This is the default.) 
                           Then only the message originator or anyone with
                           the XM GROUP PRIORITY key may forward priority
                           messages to mail groups.  

*Note: If you do nothing with this new field, then this patch will not
change MailMan's behavior with regard to the forwarding of priority messages.
Only if you answer YES will the behavior change as described above.

Let site decide whether or not to let a user drop out of a non-self-enrolling
mail group.  A new field has been added to file 4.3, MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS,
and option XMKSP has been updated to include it.  Here's the new field:

STANDARD DATA DICTIONARY #4.3 -- MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS FILE
STORED IN ^XMB(1,  (1 ENTRY)   (VERSION 7.1)

DATA     NAME                  GLOBAL        DATA
ELEMENT  TITLE                 LOCATION      TYPE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3,22   DROP OUT OF RESTRICTED GROUP 2;2 SET
 
                           '0' FOR NO;
                           '1' FOR YES;
         LAST EDITED:      JUN 06, 2000
         HELP-PROMPT:      Let users drop out of non-self-enrolling mail
                           groups?
         DESCRIPTION:      Enter YES if you wish to allow users to drop
                           out of non-self-enrolling mail groups.  The
                           users will be warned that this is a
                           non-self-enrolling group, and that they won't
                           be allowed to rejoin later, and then they will
                           be asked to re-confirm the decision to drop out.
 
                           Enter NO if you don't.  (This is the default.)
                           Then users will have to contact IRM or the mail
                           group coordinator to ask to be dropped.
 
         TECHNICAL DESCR:  If a mail group is not a self-enrolling mail
                           group, then users can't just join.  They must
                           be added by the mail group coordinator.
 
                           If a user no longer wishes to be a member of
                           such a group, he must ask the group coordinator
                           to drop him.  But what if the group coordinator
                           has left the organization or is unresponsive?
                           Then what?  Then the user will have to ask IRM
                           to help.  This problem can be avoided by
                           setting this field to YES.
 
                           Some would argue that the coordinator added the
                           user to the group for a reason, and the user
                           should not be allowed to drop out.  (Perhaps
                           the coordinator is the user's boss.)  They
                           would argue that it is MailMan's job to prevent
                           the user from dropping out.  (Set the field to
                           NO.) Others would argue that it is not
                           MailMan's job at all, but the boss's job to
                           prevent the user from dropping out, and to
                           discipline the user if he does.  (Set the field
                           to YES.)

*Note: If you do nothing with this new field, then this patch will not
change MailMan's behavior.  Users will not be able to drop out of
non-self-enrolling mail groups.

Additionally,

This patch introduces two more new APIs:
$$TPMSGCT^XMXUTIL - returns # of new priority messages in a user's mailbox.
$$BPMSGCT^XMXUTIL - returns # of new priority messages in a user's basket.

This patch fixes a problem noticed on FORUM that could cause infinite looping
of error messages from remote sites.

NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patches XM*7.1*107, XM*7.1*124,
XM*7.1*127, and XM*7.1*130.

           DESCRIPTION:    When you read new messages by basket, MailMan
                           suggests the IN basket to read first.  If you
                           want MailMan to suggest other basket(s) before 
                           suggesting the IN basket, then fill in this
                           field with a priority order number.  MailMan
                           will suggest the basket(s) in the priority
                           order set by you.  The IN basket will be
                           suggested last.  (You will not be able to
                           choose the IN basket.)  Once all the priority
                           baskets have been read, MailMan will suggest
                           baskets in alphabetical order.

Additionally:
-When sending or forwarding a message using one of the ^XMD APIs, and there
are no recipients, XMMG is set to "Error = No recipients."  Previously,
there was no error message.

-MailMan's version of FileMan's ^DIR 'set of codes' reader has been improved.
It now offers selection completion and understands either the code or the
text, and asks for clarification if the user enters something ambiguous.

NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*131.

Patch XM*7.1*142

Test Site:  Tampa, FL

NOIS: ISB-0700-32092, CMC-1299-30434, CMC-0200-31328, CMH-1199-N1398,
      CML-0700-41882, CMP-0700-61026, TAM-0300-33196
Improve remote transmit process by eliminating the phantom task number
field in piece 2 of the zero node for entries in file 4.2999.
This field is not in the data dictionary, and yet was being used, and
duplicated field 25, TRANSMISSION TASK#.  All routines which reference
the phantom field now reference field 25.  The pre-init with this patch
will set the phantom field for entries in file 4.2999 to null.

This patch also 'new's the variable ZTSYNC before creating the task to
transmit messages to a remote site.  (This will prevent "bleeding" of
SYNC FLAGs used by applications to ensure that tasks are run in sequence,
and then only if the preceding task completed successfully.)
Such SYNC FLAGs are not applicable to MailMan. 

NOTE: This patch requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*97, XM*7.1*107,
and XM*7.1*127.

Patch XM*7.1*147

NOIS: MIW-0900-41651
Test Sites:  Milwaukee, WI
This patch corrects an error which may occur in the second and subsequent
usages of SENDMSG^XMXAPI if one of the recipients is the sender of the
message and the input variable XMINSTR is used, but not newed. 
The first usage causes XMINSTR("SELF BSKT") to be set to null.  The second
and subsequent usages fail to send the message because XMINSTR("SELF BSKT")
may not be null as an input value.  The correction is that MailMan will no
longer set XMINSTR("SELF BSKT") to null.

NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*119.

Patch XM*7.1*146

E3R: 3764
Test Site: Biloxi, MS
Let the user search the Message file for messages using the same criteria
available when searching one's mailbox.  The user would be limited to
messages sent to or sent by the user.

NOIS: IOW-0500-42246
E3R: 8432
Test Site: White River Junction, VT
Let authorized users search the Message file for messages based on the same
search criteria one can use when one is searching for one's own messages.
The user would be able to search every message.
Among other uses would be the ability to follow up on EEO harassment cases
in which the offending user harassed via MailMan messages.

This patch improves the message search capability.
- The Postmaster is now able to search the remote transmit queues.
- You are now able to search for messages that have a certain number of
lines of text or more.
- You are now able to search the MESSAGE file using all the criteria
available when searching your own mailbox.
- Help frames have been updated, and new help frames have been added to
reflect the changes.
- The API LISTMSGS^XMXAPIB has been improved to incorporate the changes, too.

The following entries have been added to their respective files:

OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: 19  OPTION
(This option has been added to the XMMGR 'Manage MailMan' menu.)
NAME: XM SUPER SEARCH                   MENU TEXT: Super Search Message File
  TYPE: run routine                     CREATOR: BEUSCHEL,GARY
  LOCK: XM SUPER SEARCH                 PACKAGE: MAILMAN
 DESCRIPTION:   This option lets the authorized user (anyone holding the XM
 SUPER SEARCH key) search the Message file for messages meeting any number of
 criteria, no matter who sent the messages.
  
 This option should not be used lightly.  One example in which usage is
 justified would be the search for evidence in an EEO harassment case.
  
 This option should be audited to track who uses it.
  
 Every search will trigger the sending of the XM SUPER SEARCH bulletin to the
 XM SUPER SEARCH mail group.  The bulletin will record who (DUZ) conducted
 the  search and what criteria were used.  It will not record the results of
 the search.
  
 The XM SUPER SEARCH mail group must have at least two active local users in
 it  who have logged on recently.  If it doesn't, the search will not be
 performed.  Members of this mail group should be anyone whose responsibility
 it is to ensure that security is maintained and privileges are not abused.
 The mail group coordinator should be the site's Information Security Officer
 or another responsible individual.
  ROUTINE: SUPER^XMJMF
  UPPERCASE MENU TEXT: SUPER SEARCH MESSAGE FILE


OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: SECURITY KEY
NAME: XM SUPER SEARCH                   DESCRIPTIVE NAME: Search all messages
 DESCRIPTION:   This key lets the user use the option XM SUPER SEARCH, which
 performs a search for messages in the MESSAGE file based on multiple
 criteria.  This key should be given, on a time-limited basis, to trusted
 individuals who have a valid need to research messages in the MESSAGE file.
 For example, in sexual or other harassment cases, in which the harassment is
 in the form of MailMan messages.


OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: 3.6  BULLETIN
NAME: XM SUPER SEARCH                   SUBJECT: Super Search Conducted
  RETENTION DAYS: 90
 MESSAGE:   |1| conducted a Super Search of the Message file.  The criteria
 used were:
 DESCRIPTION:   Every time a super search is conducted, this bulletin is sent
 to alert those responsible for ensuring that the capability is not misused.
  
 A super search is a search of the entire Message file based on any number of
 criteria.  All messages are looked at, regardless of who sent them.
  
 This bulletin reports who performed the search and what criteria were used.
  
 This bulletin is sent to the mail group XM SUPER SEARCH.  The ISO should be
 a member of that group.
  
 See the XM SUPER SEARCH option for more information.
PARAMETER: 1
 DESCRIPTION:   The user who conducted the Super Search.


OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: 3.8  MAIL GROUP
NAME: XM SUPER SEARCH                   TYPE: public
  ALLOW SELF ENROLLMENT?: NO
 DESCRIPTION:   This mail group is sent a bulletin whenever someone conducts
 a Super Search using the XM SUPER SEARCH option.  The bulletin tells who
 conducted the search and what search criteria were used.
  
 Members of this mail group should be anyone who ought to be notified
 whenever a Super Search is conducted.  At an absolute minimum, the site ISO
 and alternate ISO(s) should be members.  There should be enough responsible
 members of the group so that a certain level of comfort is achieved that the
 Super Searches will only be conducted for just cause.  The more people there
 are, who are aware that a Super Search has been conducted, the less likely
 it is that the capability will be abused.
  
 The site Information Security Officer should be the coordinator of this
 group.


NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patches XM*7.1*108, XM*7.1*109,

2. Improves error tracking during message addressing:
- If you address a message to a mail group with no members, you will be
informed that the group has no members.
- ^TMP("XMERR",$J) for message addressing API errors now contains:
^TMP("XMERR",$J,&lt;error #&gt;)=&lt;dialog #&gt;
^TMP("XMERR",$J,&lt;error #&gt;,"PARAM","ID")="XMTO"
^TMP("XMERR",$J,&lt;error #&gt;,"PARAM","VALUE")=&lt;recipient&gt;
^TMP("XMERR",$J,&lt;error #&gt;,"TEXT",&lt;i&gt;)=&lt;line i of error message&gt;
^TMP("XMERR",$J,"E",&lt;dialog #&gt;,&lt;error #&gt;)=""

The pre-init with this patch deletes three DIALOG file entries which are
being replaced with new ones.

NOTE: This patch requires MailMan patches XM*7.1*133, XM*7.1*134,
XM*7.1*138, XM*7.1*139, &amp; XM*7.1*146.

Patch XM*7.1*149

NOIS: MAR-0500-22472
Test Sites:  Maryland HCS
If a user opens second session while editing a reply to a message, and
enters MailMan by typing "D ^XM" from the programmer prompt, it is possible
that the reply message stub will be killed.  When the user returns to the
first session, exits the editor, and transmits the reply, the zero node of
the reply is gone, (killed in the second session), and all that is left of
the reply is the text in the 2 node, saved by the editor.  The user would
immediately be told that a new response had arrived.  (It would be from
"* no name *" if the user backed up to see it.)  This patch fixes that. 

NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*144..

Patch XM*7.1*151

NOIS: LOM-0800-63083
Test Site:  Loma Linda, CA
If two (or more) people are signed on as the same user (either normally
or as a surrogate) and they forward the same message at the same time,
it is possible that one forward clobbers the others, and the others won't
be delivered.  This patch fixes that.

Also, this patch includes routine XMTDL2, to correct line 2 in patch
XM*7.1*150.  The code is unchanged.

NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patches XM*7.1*147 and XM*7.1*150.

Patch XM*7.1*165

NOIS: none
Test Sites:  FORUM

This patch repeats information in AXP ALERT*117, an excerpt of which follows:

TO:   AXP/VMS DSM SITES
FROM: National AXP/VMS Technical Support Team
RE:   AXP ALERT*117  HLSEVEN and XMINETMM "Openfail errors"

HLSEVEN has uncovered a VMS TCP/IP problem regarding DSM not being able to
open a BG device for use. This problem is related to multi-processor CPU
systems (i.e. ES40, 4100) with more than one CPU. It is not VMS or UCX
(TCPIP) version specific, as we have identified the problem on systems
running VMS 6.2-1H3 to VMS 7.2.1 and also UCX version 4.2 ECO 3 as well as
TCPIP version 5.0A. A condition can occur where the server site will fail
to open the BGnnnn: device and the HLSEVEN.LOG will report the following
errors:

%DSM-F-OPENERR, error opening device or file
-DSM-E-ERRCODE, Error Code = 0
-SYSTEM-F-BADPARAM, bad parameter value

VistA uses two types of "listen services", HLSEVEN and XMINETMM. Tests have
shown that the XMINETMM service is also prone to the same symptoms as seen
by the HLSEVEN service. These tests were run on the FORUM system and have
produced retries during heavy activity periods. Therefore, the AXP, HLSEVEN
and Mailman teams have agreed to jointly release the following Alert and
Informational patches. 

AXP Alert*117
HL*1.6*70
XM*7.1*165

The following is an excerpt from Compaq Engineering acknowledging our
findings and their description of the problem.

********************************************************************
Compaq

Engineering thinks the problem here is a race between the INETACP, which
has just created the process via $CREPRC(), and the process just created.

The INETACP doesn't relinquish its ownership of the BG device for the
accepted connection (which it passes in SYS$NET process logical) until
sometime after $CREPRC() returns success status.  If the process gets to
run first it may have trouble assigning this BG momentarily.  

This situation only occurs for listen services; nolisten services
(like FTP) are handled very differently.
*********************************************************************

Although this problem has been acknowledged, Compaq is reluctant to issue a
patch to the current version of TCPIP V5.0 due to its complexity. They have 
agreed to provide a fix in a future release. This future release should be 
TCPIP Services for VMS version 5.1, due sometime next year (2001). As an 
interim "work-around" solution, new HLSEVEN.COM and XMINET_ALPHA.COM command 
procedures have been written to compensate for this "race condition". 

XMINET_ALPHA.COM Descriptions

This command procedure has been edited to check the status of the BG device
prior to entering DSM. It contains two IF-THEN-ELSE statements. The first
is a loop to count to 10. The command procedure will terminate after 10
tries to gain access to the BG device. The second is a loop to test the bit
mask status [stat=f$getdvi("''x'","STS")] of the BG device. It was found
that with a bit mask value of 65552, DSM could not open the BG device but a
bit mask value of 16 allowed DSM to open the BG device. If the bit mask
value is not equal to 16, then the command procedures will wait one second
and try again. 

Typical log file entries:

Note - New log files will not be generated if the XMINET_ALPHA.LOG file
version number has reached 32767. To generate new log files, delete all
XMINET_ALPHA.LOG files and new ones will be generated starting with version
1. Please also note that empty log files may be normal. If the current log
file for the latest connection is still open and the connection is still
active, the file will be empty and nothing will be displayed. Very busy
XMINETMM services may see this and they can also generate failure to purge
error messages. Keeping more log files in the purge statement in the
command procedures can avoid purge error messages - adjust accordingly.

Patch XM*7.1*158

Test Site:  Puget Sound HCS
NOIS: RIC-1100-21104
An incoming message from a top-level domain that is not recognized by
MailMan can cause problems.  This patch prepares MailMan for that
eventuality.

These top-level domains are no longer added to file 4.2996, INTERNET
SUFFIX.  They continue to be added to file 4.2, DOMAIN.

A new bulletin, XM DOMAIN ADDED, now notifies G.POSTMASTER of these
new domains.

The pre-init, XMYPOSTD deletes all entries from the INTERNET SUFFIX
file 4.2996.  A new DD will be brought in for this file, along with
all its data.  It is populated with all the internationally recognized
top-level domains.  You will not be able to edit that file, except for
adding notes.

A 'B' xref is added to the .01 field of the TRANSMISSION SCRIPT multiple
of the DOMAIN file 4.2.  The post-init, POST^XMYPOSTD, sets the 'B' xref.

NOTE: This patch requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*50.

Patch XM*7.1*166

NOIS: TUC-0101-60657
Test Sites:  Tucson, AZ
If a site lists itself as the PARENT in file 4.3, MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS,
that can cause problems.  This patch puts a screen on that field in the DD
to prevent this from happening.

The pre-init for this patch will check to ensure that your site does not
have itself as its PARENT.  If it does, the PARENT field will be deleted
and you will have to enter the correct PARENT.

If field 3, PARENT, in file 4.3 is filled in, you should ensure that it
does not point to its own domain.  It should be the domain considered
the parent of your facility.  The parent domain is the domain to which
mail is sent, when your facility doesn't quite know what to do with it.

For example,
1. The parent domain of the MailMan development account, 
MAILMAN.ISC-SF.DOMAIN.EXT, is ISC-SF.DOMAIN.EXT.
(The parent domain should NOT be MAILMAN.ISC-SF.DOMAIN.EXT)
2. The parent domain of ISC-SF.DOMAIN.EXT is DOMAIN.EXT. It could also
be GK.DOMAIN.EXT or whatever domain your site uses to send mail to the
internet.  (The parent domain should NOT be ISC-SF.DOMAIN.EXT)

The account that you install this patch in probably matches one of the
examples.  If not, the parent domain should be the domain through which
you route messages to remote sites over the internet.

NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*50.

Patch XM*7.1*171

Test Site:  Columbia, MO
NOIS: CMO-0101-42392
Fix Filter/query messages addressed to a private mail group.
Filter won't recognize such messages at all.
Query does find them, but the user interface is problematical when changing
the 'addressed to' selection.

In the FILTER subfile of file 3.7, MAILBOX,
Field 5, FROM, has some new help text.
Field 6, ADDRESSED TO, is expanded to 55 characters.

NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patches XM*7.1*146 and XM*7.1*150.

Patch XM*7.1*176

Test Site:  FORUM

NOIS: none
Improve MailMan's actions at the sending site during remote transmissions
if the receiving site notifies the sending site that a recipient isn't found.

We had a problem at GATEWAY transmitting to GK.  GK didn't like a recipient,
so GATEWAY tried again in lower case, as it usually does.  GK then closed
the connection.  This left the offending message clogging the queue at
GATEWAY.  The fix is that if the receiving site is non-MailMan, and the
receiving site does not like the recipient, the sending site will not try
that recipient again.

NOTE: This patch requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*148.

Patch XM*7.1*163

E3R 2658, 8649, 15053
Test Sites:  Puget Sound HCS, Charleston, SC
When users join a mail group, or when users are added to mail groups,
optionally Find and Forward past mail group messages to the users.

The following options now include this capability:
XMEDITMG                       - Mail Group Edit
XMENROLL                       - Enroll in (or Disenroll from) a Mail Group
XMMGR-MAIL-GRP-COORDINATOR     - Mail Group Coordinator's Edit
XMMGR-MAIL-GRP-COORD-W/REMOTES - Mail Group Coordinator's Edit W/Remotes
XMEDITPERSGROUP                - Personal Mail Group Edit

The option XMEDITMG is being converted from an 'edit' type option to a 'run
routine' type option.  The pre-init, ^XMYPRE11, will delete the fields in the
option which are no longer applicable.

The pre-init will also check entries in file 3.8, MAIL GROUP.  If the group is
public, any entry in the 'Restrictions' field (#10) will be deleted.  (This
field only applies to private groups.)  If the group is private, any entry in
the 'Allow self-enrollment?' (#7) field will be deleted.  This field only
applies to public groups. 

If someone other than the organizer or coordinator adds users to a public
mail group which doesn't allow self-enrollment, or to a private mail group,
a new bulletin, XM GROUP EDIT NOTIFY, is sent to the organizer and
coordinator to let them know which users were added and who added them.

A new security key, XM GROUP EDIT MASTER, is being created, which should be
assigned to any users, such as ADPACs, who need to be able to edit other
users' mail groups.
NAME: XM GROUP EDIT MASTER
  DESCRIPTIVE NAME: Edit other users' mail groups
 DESCRIPTION:   People who need to be able to edit other users' mail groups
 and add new users to them should be assigned this key.  
  
 Holders of this key may edit any mail group, except personal mail groups. 
 (Personal mail groups are those which only the organizer may edit or use.) 
  
 The following users should NOT be given this key, because they already
 possess the privilege this key grants: 
  - Holders of the XMMGR key.  
  - Clinical Application Coordinators, as identified in file 8930,
 USR Class, belonging to the TIU package.  

Applicable Help frames are updated.

New APIs have been added.  See DBIA 3006.
ADDMBRS^XMXAPIG  - Add members to mail groups.  Optionally forward past
                   mail group messages.

Patch XM*7.1*177

NOIS: IVM-0301-32726, BAY-0101-30908
Test Site: HEC-ATLANTA; Bay Pines, FL
At times of high messaging activity, contention in getting locks on the
MESSAGE file causes problems.  This patch attempts to ameliorate that
problem by removing MailMan's locking of the MESSAGE file, and letting
FileMan handle it alone.  You will never again see the message, "We're
having problems getting a lock on the MESSAGE file, do you want to wait?"

Additionally, the group message actions have been made more efficient.
Actions involving new messages are faster.  Actions involving moving
messages out of a basket are faster.  So, 'New Toggle', 'Delete',
'Terminate', 'Filter', and 'Save' are faster.

NOTE: This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
minimum.  It requires MailMan patches XM*7.1*126, *136, *143, *151, *168, &amp;
*172.

E3R: 3753
Recognize and support the vaporize days field which is in file #3.6,
BULLETIN.  (This is field #5, RETENTION DAYS, which has been there since
1994, but never used!) If the field is filled in, the bulletin will be set
to vaporize that many days from the time the bulletin is sent. 

NOIS: PUG-0800-50981
E3R: 2736, 2765, 3286, 8959, 10302, 12540
Warn the user of an impending purge-by-date a certain number of days before
the messages are actually purged.  The warning will be a broadcast bulletin,
which will vaporize on the purge date.  This patch includes updated options
XMKSP and XMPURGE-BY-DATE, new bulletin XM DATE PURGE WARNING, and two new
fields in file #4.3, MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS.  Read on for details.

Two new fields have been added to file #4.3 MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS.  The
option XMKSP, to edit those parameters, has been updated to include them.

                             At the scheduled date/time, the bulletin, XM
                             DATE PURGE WARNING, is broadcast to all users
                             to warn them of the coming date purge, and the
                             actual date purge is then queued to run this
                             many days later.  
                                 
                             If this field is null, the date purge will run
                             at the scheduled date/time, and no bulletin
                             will be sent.  

You are now able to schedule the option XMPURGE-BY-DATE.  You couldn't do
that before.

NAME: XMPURGE-BY-DATE
  MENU TEXT: Purge Messages by Origination Date
  TYPE: run routine                     CREATOR: POSTMASTER
  LOCK: XMMGR                           PACKAGE: MAILMAN
 DESCRIPTION:   You must hold the XMMGR and XMSTAR keys to run this option.  
  
 XMPURGE-BY-DATE will delete *all* messages originating before a cutoff
 date. It will delete those messages from users' mailboxes, and then delete
 them from the MESSAGE file, along with any responses chained to them. This
 flexible option can be run interactively or scheduled to run on a
 recurring basis, the cutoff date can be controlled, users may or may not
 be sent a warning bulletin to warn them of the purge ahead of time, and
 the option may produce a report to show how many messages and responses it
 deleted.

 When the option is run interactively:

 1) It asks for the cutoff date. The default is based on the DATE PURGE
 CUTOFF DAYS field (10.03) in the MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS file (4.3). If
 that field is null, it defaults to 730 days (2 years) in the past.

 2) It asks whether to run the option in Test mode. In Test mode, the
 option will not purge any messages, just report how many and which would
 have been purged.

 3) It asks for the output device on which to print the report. The purge
 and report can be queued here to run later.

 4) If it's queued more than 3 days in the future, the option immediately
 broadcasts the XM DATE PURGE WARNING bulletin to all users to notify them
 of the upcoming purge and give them a chance to save off old messages
 beforehand.

 5) If it's queued less than 3 days in the future, or is not queued, no
 bulletin is sent.

 When the option is scheduled:

 1) The option runs at the scheduled time, as specified by the QUEUED TO
 RUN AT WHAT TIME field (2) of the OPTION SCHEDULING file (19.2).

 2) If the RESCHEDULING FREQUENCY field (6) of file 19.2 is set, the option
 is scheduled to run repeatedly.

 3) It uses the DATE PURGE CUTOFF DAYS field, or the default of 730 days if
 it's empty, to calculate the cutoff date.

 4) It does not run in Test mode.

 5) If the DATE PURGE GRACE PERIOD field (10.04) of file 4.3 is empty, the
 purge runs at the time for which the option is scheduled.

 6) Otherwise, at the scheduled time the option only broadcasts the XM DATE
 PURGE WARNING bulletin to all users and queues a second task to perform
 the date purge GRACE PERIOD number of days later.

 7) If the DEVICE FOR QUEUED JOB OUTPUT field (3) of file 19.2 is empty,
 the purge runs without printing a report.

 8) Otherwise it prints the report on the selected device.

 *Messages in SHARED,MAIL's mailbox and messages in the POSTMASTER's remote
 transmit queues and server baskets (including released patch messages on
 FORUM) are exempt from the purge.

Patch XM*7.1*181

NOIS: DAY-0401-42491
Test Site:  Dayton, OH
When adding a new member to a mail group, and choosing to forward existing
group messages to the new member, MailMan asks for a date range of messages
to search.  If the oldest message on the system is less than one year old,
then MailMan should give a default date of the oldest message, instead of a
date from a year ago.  This patch fixes that.

NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*163.

Patch XM*7.1*180

NOIS ANN-0401-41468
Test Site: ANN-ARBOR, MI
A bogus message number at the end of the MESSAGE file 3.9 prevents the
option XMMGR-PURGE-MESSAGE from functioning properly and letting a user
select a message to purge.  This patch checks for and kills such bogus
message numbers, so that the purge selection functions properly.

Patch XM*7.1*51

Test Sites:  Montana HCS; Biloxi, MS

NOIS: DET-0898-40391, CIH-1197-40757, ALL-0297-41999, BTM-1095-10195

Patch XM*7.1*50, released August 1999, added ".DOMAIN.EXT" synonyms in the
DOMAIN file for every site which requested it.  It also added new names as
synonyms for sites which have merged or which requested and had name changes
approved. 

This patch will complete the 2-step domain name change process begun in patch
XM*7.1*50. The synonyms will become the new domain names, and the old domain
names will become the synonyms.  The domain names will be changed in the
transmission scripts.  The names of the transmission queues will be changed.
(These are the Postmaster's baskets where the messages waiting to be
transmitted are kept.)  And finally, the domain name of the site will be
changed, too, if it is one of the sites which requested it. 

This will all happen automatically, during the post-init.  It should take
less than 5 minutes.  You will be instructed to review the install file print
to check for and correct any errors after the patch has been installed. 

The domain name changes will not adversely affect the flow of mail.

This patch will also begin the 2-step domain name change process for the
second round of domain name changes.  It will add as synonyms the desired
new names for sites which requested it.  For all other VA sites, which did
not express any interest in changing their names, it will add a synonym of
xxx.DOMAIN.EXT.  A future patch will complete the domain name change
process, once all sites have installed this patch.

NOTE: This patch requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*50.

have its new name added as a synonym.  (Error messages are preceded by ***,
and tell you what was wrong.)  You must correct the error manually and add
the synonym manually.  Remember, you are not to change any domain name.
Just add the new name as a synonym. 

Review the automatic domain name changes which occurred during the POST-INIT.
If there were any errors noted for a particular domain, that domain did not
have its name changed.  (Error messages are preceded by ***,
and tell you what was wrong.)  You must correct the error manually and
perform the name change manually.

Patch XM*7.1*184

Test Site:  Reno, NV
If a user, who does not hold the XMMGR key and is not a Postmaster
surrogate, goes into SHARED,MAIL and attempts to resequence messages
in a basket, MailMan tells the user he's resequencing, but then doesn't
resequence them.  This patch fixes that.

Patch XM*7.1*189

NOIS: HUN-1100-22076, ALB-0301-52954, CTX-0401-70603
Test Site:  
Sometimes, when a user is editing a reply in one MailMan session, and then
starts a second MailMan session, the reply message stub is killed by the
second session.  When the user returns to the first session and sends the
reply, the reply appears to be from "* No Name *".  This patch detects when
the stub has been killed, and recreates it.

NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*177.

Patch XM*7.1*179

E3R 15242
Test Sites:  Puget Sound HCS
Make tasked options XMCLEAN, XMAUTOPURGE, XMPURGE, and XMUT-CHKFIL honor
TaskMan stop requests.

Improve the description for options XMCLEAN, XMAUTOPURGE, XMPURGE, XMSTAT,
and XMUT-CHKFIL.  Change option XMPURGE from an "action" type to a
"run routine" type.  (Pre-init XMYPRE11 will help do this.)

Here, then, are the options:

NAME: XMCLEAN                           MENU TEXT: Clean out waste baskets
  TYPE: run routine                     CREATOR: POSTMASTER
 DESCRIPTION:   This option empties users' WASTE baskets, that is, it deletes
 all the messages in users' WASTE baskets in the MAILBOX file 3.7.  Messages in
 the MESSAGE file 3.9 are not affected.  
  
 It is recommended that this option be scheduled to run daily, right before
 option XMAUTOPURGE.  
  ROUTINE: CLEAN^XMA3                   SCHEDULING RECOMMENDED: YES
  UPPERCASE MENU TEXT: CLEAN OUT WASTE BASKETS


NAME: XMPURGE                           MENU TEXT: Purge Unreferenced Messages
  TYPE: run routine                     CREATOR: POSTMASTER
 DESCRIPTION:   This  option, if scheduled, does exactly what option
 XMAUTOPURGE does, and then stops.  
  
 This  option, if run interactively, does exactly what option XMAUTOPURGE does,
 and then it does exactly what option XMSTAT does, and then it stops.  
  
 You should NOT schedule this option.  
  ROUTINE: SCAN^XMA3
  UPPERCASE MENU TEXT: PURGE UNREFERENCED MESSAGES


NAME: XMAUTOPURGE
  MENU TEXT: Automatic Purge of MailMan Messages
  TYPE: run routine                     CREATOR: POSTMASTER
 DESCRIPTION:   This option automatically purges unreferenced MailMan messages,
 that is, it deletes from file 3.9, MESSAGE, any messages which are not in 
 anyone's basket.  It is strongly recommended that this option be scheduled to
 run daily, right after option XMCLEAN.  
  
 The following messages are considered 'referenced', and will not be purged: 
  - Messages in user baskets 
  - Messages in transit (arriving or being sent) 
  - Server messages 
  - Messages being edited (including aborted edits) 
  - Messages which have been latered 
  
 Several fields in file 4.3, MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS, influence the behavior of
 this option.  Here they are, but feel free to look at their Data Dictionary
 descriptions for more information on them: 
  
 4.301 - NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER - MailMan does not purge any messages created or
 received in the last few days.  You choose how many days.  The default is 2.  
  
 142   - NO-PURGE DAYS BUFFER (LOCAL) - MailMan does not purge local messages
 created in the last few days.  You choose how many days.  The default is 7.  
  
 4.304 - WEEKDAY DAYS TO PURGE - On Saturdays, MailMan goes through the entire
 MESSAGE file looking for messages to purge.  On the other days of the week,
 however, MailMan has the option of only looking at messages created or
 received recently.  You choose how many days.  The default is to go through
 the entire MESSAGE file.  It is strongly recommended that you set this field
 to something reasonable, like 30 to 60 days.  (But only if you follow the
 recommendation to schedule this option to run daily.  Otherwise leave this
 field blank.) 
  
 4.303 - AUTOMATIC INTEGRITY CHECK - MailMan gives you the option of running
 the MAILBOX file portion of the integrity checker (option XMUT-CHKFIL) before
 it actually purges the unreferenced messages.  The M xref on file 3.7 is used
 to determine whether a message is referenced (in someone's basket) or not.  If
 the M xref is messed up, then the purge might delete messages it shouldn't, or
 leave message it should delete.  The integrity checker ensures that the M xref
 is correct.  You choose whether to run it or not.  The default is to run it. 
 The recommendation is to run it.  However, if you find that it is simply
 taking too long, you may opt not to run it.  If you opt not to run it, then it
 is recommended that you schedule option XMUT-CHKFIL to run monthly, because
 globals can and do become corrupted.  
  INDEPENDENTLY INVOCABLE: NO
  ROUTINE: EN^XMA3                      TIMESTAMP: 55536,32239

  SCHEDULING RECOMMENDED: YES
  UPPERCASE MENU TEXT: AUTOMATIC PURGE OF MAILMAN MES


NAME: XMSTAT                            MENU TEXT: Message statistics
  TYPE: run routine                     CREATOR: POSTMASTER
  PACKAGE: MAILMAN
 DESCRIPTION:   This interactive option displays information about past purges
 and about current mailbox usage.  This option should not be scheduled.  
  
 First, it displays the types and results of the last 20 purges of the MESSAGE
 file 3.9.  It tells you whether the purge was an unreferenced message purge
 (option XMPURGE or XMAUTOPURGE), or a date purge (option XMPURGE-BY-DATE).  It
 tells you when it started and ended, how long it took, how many messages were
 purged, and how many were left.  
  
 Next, it displays information about each user in the MESSAGE file 3.7.  It
 tells you how many messages they have in their mailboxes, when they last
 logged on, and when they last used MailMan.  
  ROUTINE: STAT^XMA3                    UPPERCASE MENU TEXT: MESSAGE STATISTICS


NAME: XMUT-CHKFIL
  MENU TEXT: Check MailMan Files for Errors
  TYPE: run routine                     CREATOR: BEUSCHEL,GARY
  LOCK: XUPROG                          PACKAGE: MAILMAN
 DESCRIPTION:   This option checks for and corrects errors in the MAILBOX file
 3.7 and the MESSAGE file 3.9.  It checks important fields and cross
 references.  
  
 It is recommended that this option be run monthly or every few months, or
 whenever there seems to be a database problem.  
  
 It produces a report of the errors detected, and what, if anything, it did to
 fix them.  If it didn't fix them, it tells you what you can do to fix them.  
  
 Although the system will not fail because of errors detected, your users may
 call you about the problems they experience.  This utility will allow you to
 detect them first and correct them before anyone knows.

NOIS BHH-0701-40720
Test Sites: BLACK HILLS HCS
Currently, broadcast message replies are delivered, but are not seen as
new to the users.  This is because such broadcasts do not have recipient
lists (under QD), and MailMan uses recipient lists to deliver replies.
To fix this, MailMan will no longer permit a reply to such broadcasts.
A new broadcast message will have to be sent, in lieu of a reply.  This
will ensure that all recipients, even those with forwarding addresses,
see the intended reply.

Patch XM*7.1*192

NOIS ISW-0701-21674
Test Sites: OIFO-Washington; Oklahoma City
This patch concerns options XMMGR-TERMINATE-MANY and XMMGR-TERMINATE-SUGGEST,
which check to see if users should have their mailboxes deleted, because they
haven't used MailMan in a while, or because there's something screwy about
them in the NEW PERSON file, such as a missing access or verify code or main
menu, or they were terminated and were allowed to keep their mailbox.  This
patch closes some loopholes which caused some users to be targeted for
mailbox deletion, when they really shouldn't have been.

Some users never log on, but have forwarding addresses and have all their
mail forwarded.  Previously, these options might have deleted their
mailboxes.  Now, a report suggests further investigation.

Some users never log on, but have surrogates read and answer their mail.
Previously, these options might have deleted their mailboxes.  Now, they
are left alone.

Some users don't log on traditionally, so their last logon date might be
really old.  However, they do manage to read mail, one way or another.
Previously, these options might have suggested their mailboxes be deleted.
Now they are left alone.

Two more columns have been added to the XMMGR-TERMINATE-SUGGEST report.
If a user has been DISUSER'd, the user is included in the report, and that
fact is noted on the report.  Also, if the user has any surrogates, one of
them is shown.  (Space limitations prevent showing more than one.)

Option descriptions are updated.

Additionally, if a user's mailbox is deleted, MailMan now looks to see if
the user is a coordinator or organizer of any mail group.  If so, MailMan
replaces the user with the Postmaster.  Previously, those fields were not
checked at all.

NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*180.

Patch XM*7.1*193

NOIS ISW-0801-20974
Test Sites: OIFO Washington

If you use the MailMan option for transferring VistA email messages via
disk/tape to another site, you will have problems if the SEND field
setting for the TAPE entry in the Communications Protocol file is wrong.
The SEND field for the TAPE entry must be set to:

SEND: W XMSG,! ; S XMTRAN="S: "_XMSG D TRAN^XMC1
            ==
Most of the entries we have found for this don't have the ",!" following
the "W XMS".  Without the ",!" you don't get the line feed at the end of
each line. This causes a buffer overflow when you try to receive the
message.  Please look at your entry, and edit, if necessary:

Using FileMan:

Select OPTION: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES  
               =====
INPUT TO WHAT FILE: COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL// &lt;press enter&gt;
EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// SEND
                        ====
THEN EDIT FIELD: &lt;press enter&gt;


Select COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL NAME: TAPE
                                     ====

If a surrogate with just read privilege (not send) assumes a user's
identity, and that user has an unsent message in the buffer, the surrogate
is thrown off the system.  This patch takes a gentler approach.  The
surrogate can now decide whether to delete the unsent message and then
read and reply to messages normally, or to leave the unsent message alone
and still be able to read messages, but not reply to them.

If a surrogate with send privilege assumes a user's identity, and
that user is logged on and composing a message, the surrogate is thrown
off the system.  This patch takes a gentler approach.  The surrogate is
told that the session is concurrent with another, and is not thrown off.

If a user starts up a second MailMan session while in the middle of
editing a message in the first MailMan session, the user may be thrown
off the system.  This patch takes a gentler approach.  The user is told
that the session is concurrent with another, and is not thrown off.

NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*189.

Patch XM*7.1*194

NOIS PUG-0801-51201
Test Site: Puget Sound HCS

DOMAIN.EXT (or the gateway to it) sometimes sets limits on the number
of recipients that can be on a message sent from another site.  It's
an anti-spam measure.  Once it hits that number, it won't accept any
more recipients, and if the site tries to send more, DOMAIN.EXT closes
the connection.

MailMan has code designed to detect bad forwarding addresses and remove
them. It makes the decision to delete a forwarding address based on
receiving an error (any error!) from the remote site after having given
the remote site a message recipient.  Unfortunately, DOMAIN.EXT's anti-
spam measure has caused MailMan to delete perfectly good forwarding
addresses.  This patch changes what MailMan does once a remote site says,
"Stop! I can't can't take any more!":
1) MailMan doesn't delete the user's forwarding address.
2) MailMan stops trying to add more recipients.

Here's a sample of the messages which let the user know his forwarding
address was deleted (inappropriately!).

Subj: Forwarding Address Deleted  [#34506097] 14 Aug 01 13:02  4 lines
From: POSTMASTER - COMPUTER PROGRAMMER  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Your forwarding address: &lt;not shown&gt;@DOMAIN.EXT
has been deleted because it is not valid.
The error message is:
552 Too many recipients, max 50

Subj: Forwarding Address Deleted  [#34506097] 14 Aug 01 13:02  4 lines
From: POSTMASTER - COMPUTER PROGRAMMER  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Your forwarding address: &lt;not shown&gt;@DOMAIN.EXT
has been deleted because it is not valid.
The error message is:
221 Closing connection

This patch ensures that a user's forwarding address will not be deleted as
a result of error messages such as those above.

is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patches XM*7.1*159, *173, *179 &amp; *182.

If you scramble a message with a string of 2's as the password, and send
the message to a remote site, the recipient will not be able to open it.
 
If you scramble a message with a string of any other repeating character
as the password, the recipient (remote or not) will be able to open it
by entering any number of that character.  For example, if the password
is AAAAA, the recipient can open the message by entering AAA or AAAAAAA.
 
For this reason, this patch will prohibit the use of repeating characters
as passwords for scrambled messages.

Patch XM*7.1*199

NOIS none
Test Sites: FORUM; OIFO Oakland

If you send a message to an AOL account, AOL reports to the recipient that
the message is from an unknown sender at an unknown domain.  Testing has
shown that this is because the header fields do not have a space after the
colon.  This patch inserts a space after the colon, to make AOL happy.

This patch also:
- changes *7 to $C(7).
- makes the menus appear faster by setting invalid choices to dialog file
entry numbers, instead of dialog file text.
- improves the file check of file 3.9 by checking the entire "C" xref of the
recipient multiple.  Previously, only those related to local recipients were
checked; now, those of remote recipients are included, too.
- uses dialog file entries in places they hadn't been used before.
- makes the choices line up better when becoming a surrogate.
- warns users who are sending a message Later that if they minused anyone
from any groups, those minuses will be ignored.  If they want the minuses
to be honored, they must transmit the message now.

NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity is
at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patches XM*7.1*155,*161,*170,*190 &amp; *194.

Patch XM*7.1*200

NOIS PUG-1101-52069
Test Site: Puget Sound HCS

When auto-forwarding or filter-forwarding messages, MailMan does not retain
the event chain as well as it should.  This can lead to questions as to how
a message was forwarded.  This patch addresses that problem by making it
clear how messages came to be forwarded.

Here are some scenarios:

1. A user has a forwarding address, with no local delivery.  Someone
forwards the user a message, and it gets auto-forwarded.  We can't tell
who forwarded the message to the user.  This is the situation described
in the NOIS.  Here's the QD before the patch:

ANNA.GLYPTA@DOMAIN.EXT
                   Forwarded by: GLYPTA,ANNA 27 Nov 01 11:11

Here's the QD after the patch:

ANNA.GLYPTA@DOMAIN.EXT
                   Auto-Forwarded by: GLYPTA,ANNA 27 Nov 01 11:11
                   Forwarded to GLYPTA,ANNA by: OLEUM,LYNN

2. Same scenario as above, but a different forwarder.
Here's the QD before the patch:

ANNA.GLYPTA@DOMAIN.EXT
                   Forwarded by: GLYPTA,ANNA 27 Nov 01 11:11

Here's the QD after the patch:

ANNA.GLYPTA@DOMAIN.EXT
                   Auto-Forwarded by: GLYPTA,ANNA 27 Nov 01 11:11
                   Filter-Forwarded to GLYPTA,ANNA by: PATCH,USER

3. This is a simpler scenario.  There's no question as to who forwarded
the message, but we're not sure how.  Here's the QD before the patch:

GLYPTA,ANNA
                   Forwarded by: PATCH,USER 27 Nov 01 11:11

Here's the QD after the patch:

GLYPTA,ANNA
                   Filter-Forwarded by: PATCH,USER 27 Nov 01 11:11

The API QD^XMXUTIL3 is enhanced to include this new information.  Additional
fields returned under XMTROOT for each recipient:
"FWD TYPE"         (present only if forwarding is not "regular")
                   Type of forwarding.
                   "F" - Filter-Forward
                   "A" - Auto-Forward
                   "R" - Regular-Forward (default)

"FWD BY ORIG"      (present only if "FWD TYPE" is "A")
                   Name of the person, possibly followed by, in parentheses,
                   the name of the surrogate of the person, who forwarded
                   the message to the recipient, who had auto-forwarding.

"FWD TYPE ORIG"    (present only if "FWD TYPE" is "A" and the "FWD BY ORIG"
                   person filter-forwarded to the recipient.)
                   Type of forwarding, which led to the auto-forwarding.
                   "F" - Filter-Forward
                   "R" - Regular-Forward (default)

In order to facilitate this, three new fields are added to the recipient
multiple in file 3.9:

           HELP-PROMPT:      What kind of forwarding?
           DESCRIPTION:      Regular-Forward - A user simply forwarded this
                             message to the recipient in the .01 field.
                             This is the default, if this field is null.

                             Auto-Forward - A user has a forwarding address
                             listing the recipient in the .01 field.  This
                             message was sent to the user and then
                             automatically forwarded to the recipient.

                             Filter-Forward - A user has an active message
                             filter listing the recipient in the .01 field
                             as a "forward to" person.  This message was
                             sent to the user and then automatically
                             forwarded to the recipient during message
                             delivery.

           DESCRIPTION:      This field is only used if FWD TYPE is

                             user (and possibly the user's surrogate) who
                             forwarded the message to the user with the
                             forwarding address.

           LAST EDITED:      NOV 28, 2001
           HELP-PROMPT:      What kind of forwarding, originally?
           DESCRIPTION:      This field is only used if FWD TYPE is
                             Auto-Forward.  This field reveals how the
                             message was forwarded to the user who had the
                             forwarding address listing the recipient in
                             the .01 field.

                             Regular-Forward - A user simply forwarded this
                             message to the user with the forwarding
                             address.  This is the default, if this field
                             is null.

                             Filter-Forward - A user has an active message
                             filter listing the user with the forwarding
                             address as a "forward to" person.  This message
                             was sent to the user and then automatically
                             forwarded to the user during message delivery.

                             Note that Auto-Forward is not a possibility,
                             because Auto-Forward is allowed only to remote
                             recipients or to devices or servers.

is at a minimum.  It requires MailMan patches XM*7.1*163 &amp; *177.

Patch XM*7.1*201

NOIS: none
Test Site: Biloxi, MS

If the Postmaster goes into one of the baskets of messages waiting to be
transmitted to a remote site, and does a query to find a particular set of
messages, and then tries to toggle the transmission priority on some of
them, MailMan will abort.  This patch fixes that.

If you reply to a scrambled message while reading new messages, and hit
'transmit', MailMan informs you that it is "scrambling..." your reply.
If you reply to a scrambled message while reading existing messages in a
basket, and hit 'transmit', MailMan fails to inform you that it is
"scrambling..." your reply. This patch fixes that. 

If an address to a remote, non-MailMan site has blanks in it (but no commas),
the blanks should be translated to underscores, but aren't.  This patch fixes
that.

NOTE: This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
minimum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*196 and *199.

Patch XM*7.1*198

Test Sites:  Montana HCS; Biloxi, MS

NOIS: none; E3R: none

Patch XM*7.1*51, released May 2001, ensured that every VHA site had
a ".DOMAIN.EXT" synonym in the DOMAIN file.  It also added new names as
synonyms for sites which requested name changes because of mergers, or
otherwise, and had name changes approved. 

This patch will complete the 2-step domain name change process begun in
patch XM*7.1*51. The synonyms will become the new domain names, and the
old domain names will become the synonyms.  The domain names will be
changed in the transmission scripts.  The names of the transmission queues
will be changed.  (These are the Postmaster's baskets where the messages
waiting to be transmitted are kept.)  And finally, the domain name of the
site will be changed, too, if it is one of the sites which requested it. 

This will all happen automatically, during the post-init.  It should take
less than 5 minutes.  You will be instructed to review the install file print
to check for and correct any errors after the patch has been installed. 

The domain name changes will not adversely affect the flow of mail.

This patch will also begin the 2-step domain name change process for the
next round of domain name changes.  It will add as synonyms the desired
new names for sites which requested it.  A future patch will complete the
domain name change process, once all sites have installed this patch.

NOTE: This patch requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*51.

Patch XM*7.1*202

NOIS: LAS-0102-62116
Test Site: Las Vegas, NV; Puget Sound HCS; FORUM
If a site has its own domain closed (FLAGS=C) in the Domain file 4.2,
MailMan will accept mail addressed to the site by its name, but reject
mail addressed to the site by any of its synonyms.  This patch fixes that.
The mail is now accepted, regardless of whether it's addressed using the
site name or synonym, or the value of the FLAGS field.

E3R: 15051, 16001
Test Site: Puget Sound HCS; FORUM
Currently, when displaying a list of messages using the Summary message
display, the number of characters allotted to the subject is the same as
the number of characters allotted to the sender.  This patch changes that
ratio.  Now twice as many characters are allotted to the subject as are
allotted to the sender.  This is the same ratio as has always been used
in the Detail message display.

NOTE: This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a

Patch XM*7.1*203

NOIS: DAY-0202-42705
Test Site: Dayton, OH

If MailMan detects a control character in a routine when creating a PackMan
message, it aborts with a "level" error.  This patch fixes that.

NOIS: none
Test Site: FORUM

If a message in a remote transmit queue has already transmitted, but for
whatever reason is stuck in the queue, it holds up all the rest of the
messages in the queue.  Manual intervention is required to delete the
message from the queue.  This patch fixes that.  Such a message is now
automatically deleted from the queue.

NOTE: This patch should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a

MailMan 8.0

Test Sites: FORUM, San Francisco, Central Alabama, FO-Albany, FO-Oakland

MailMan 8.0 is a maintenance release.  It includes the complete MailMan
suite of data dictionaries, but it does not populate the files.  This
version expects that a site already has MailMan 7.1 installed and running,
and that it is patched through XM*7.1*198.  It is also expected that
Kernel 8.0 and FileMan 22.0 are installed and are reasonably up-to-date
(through patches XU*8.0*216 and DI*22.0*68, respectively).

MailMan 8.0 offers the following improvements over MailMan 7.1:

1. MailMan is now DNS aware.  It can use the Kernel API MAIL^XLFNSLK
to retrieve IP addresses.  It is no longer necessary to manually update the
IP addresses in the DOMAIN file, 4.2.  The IP address fields will remain in
file 4.2, and MailMan will use them.  However, if they don't work, MailMan
will use the Kernel API to retrieve a list of valid IP addresses.  When
MailMan finds one that works, MailMan will replace the non-working IP
address with the working one.  In order to activate DNS awareness, this
new field in the MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS file 4.3 must be set to 'yes':
     4.3,8.22   DNS AWARE                        Yes or No?
Also, routine ^XLFNSLK must exist, and the following field in the
KERNEL SYSTEMS PARAMETERS file 8989.3 must be properly filled in with
an IP address:
     8989.3,51  DNS IP                           IP address for DNS

2. For TCP/IP connections, MailMan can now build transmission scripts
on-the-fly.  (Transmission scripts exist in the DOMAIN file 4.2, in the
TRANSMISSION SCRIPT multiple, in the TEXT field 2.)  If the TYPE is "SMTP",
"TCPCHAN", or null, and the TEXT field has no records, and these fields
in the MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS file 4.3 are filled in:
     4.3,8.23   TCP/IP COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL   Points to file 3.4
     4.3,8.24   TCP/IP TRANSMISSION SCRIPT       Points to file 4.6
...then MailMan creates the script.  This one is for FORUM:
     O H=DOMAIN.EXT,P=TCP/IP-MAILMAN
     C TCPCHAN-SOCKET25
where:
     "DOMAIN.EXT" is taken from the DOMAIN name.
     "TCP/IP-MAILMAN" is the protocol pointed to by field 8.23
     "TCPCHAN-SOCKET25" is the script pointed to by field 8.24.

3. Messages in transmit queues can now be designated as low priority, as
well as high priority.  If a message gets stuck in a transmit queue and is
holding up the rest of the queue for whatever reason, MailMan will make
that message a low priority message, so that all the other messages are
transmitted ahead of it.  The postmaster can also make these priority
changes.  In the message queue, high-priority messages are now marked with
'^', instead of '$'.  Low priority messages are marked with 'v'.

The postmaster can now change the transmit priority at the message level
(at the 'Message action: Ignore//' prompt).  As at the basket level, the
command to use is 'X'.  (In a user basket, the 'X' at the message level is
a command to unload a PackMan message or KIDS build.  In a remote transmit
queue, the 'X' changes the transmit priority.  The difference is the
context, and writers of MailMan front-ends should take note!)

4. MailMan date/times are now in a standard format, produced by the Kernel
API: $$FMTE^XLFDT(datetime,"2Z").  Previously, 3020803.153204 would be
displayed as '03 Aug 02 15:32'.  Now, it is displayed as '08/03/02@15:32'.
This change is also carried through to all MailMan APIs which return
date/time in MailMan format.  Users of such APIs should take note!

5. MailMan remote message IDs now include the message date, to ensure that
if you are told that a message is a duplicate of a previously received
message, it really is.  Sites will no longer have problems sending messages
from a production account to a test account which was created by "mirroring"
the production account.  The remote message ID is now the message number
following by a period, followed by the 7-digit FileMan message creation
date.  Before, a remote message ID might be 34561234@DOMAIN.EXT.  Now it
would be 34561234.3020803@DOMAIN.EXT.

6. The ^XMC*, ^XMR*, ^XMS* suite of routines, which are responsible for
scheduling, transmitting to, and receiving messages from remote sites, have
been completely overhauled to make them easier to understand and easier to
maintain.

7. MailMan will no longer display user names by taking them directly from
the .01 field of the NEW PERSON file, 200.  The API, $$NAMEFMT^XLFNAME,
supplied as part of the Name Standardization project, is used, instead.
Thus, the names of people whose last names, for instance, contain periods,
apostrophes, or spaces, are properly displayed (ST. IVES, O'MALLEY, and
VAN DYKE), instead of improperly (STIVES, OMALLEY, and VANDYKE).

8. In response to NOIS FAV-0202-71819, messages with responses may no longer
be forwarded to broadcast to all users.  Such messages may have important
information in the responses, and as we all know, responses are not auto-
forwarded to remote sites for users with auto-forward addresses.  Users who
attempt to broadcast messages with responses will be encouraged to copy the
message and its responses into a new message, which can be broadcast.

9. Incoming PackMan and KIDS messages are no longer subject to the
restriction NETWORK - MAX LINES RECEIVE (field 8.31, file 4.3).  Other kinds
of messages continue to be subject to that restriction.

10. If a task transmitting messages to another site fails and has to be
requeued, it really is requeued.  Previously, that wasn't true.  Previously,
the failing task queued up a new task to take its place, and then the
failing task stopped.

11. You can now send, forward, or filter-forward messages to H.device
(Headerless print).  It will print the message, without a header, on the
device.  As before, sending messages to D.device will print them with
a header.

12. In response to NOIS HWH-0502-41774, if you become a surrogate of a user,
and try to access a message that the user is not on (but you are), you will
be told that you will have to forward the message to the user, in order to
access it as the user.  You will then be given the opportunity to forward
it, if it's OK to do so.  (For example, if the message is closed, you would
not be allowed to forward it, if you didn't send it.)

13. In response to NOIS CHY-0597-50209, when using TalkMan to communicate
with a site, MailMan will only consider using scripts whose TYPE is TELNET.

14. The pre-init, PRE^XMYPRE, will
- K ^DOPT("XMC"), to reset the programmer options (D ^XMC).
- Kill the old "AC" xref definition for NETWORK PRIORITY TRANSMISSION field
6, in the basket multiple of file 3.7, and change all xrefs
^XMB(3.7,.5,2,"AC",1,XMK,XMZ) to ^XMB(3.7,.5,2,XMK,1,"AC",1,XMZ).
- Delete the following fields from file 4.2999, MESSAGE STATISTICS, because
they are not used:
     7  OUTGOING MESSAGE COUNT
     8  CHARACTERS REC'D
     9  INCOMING MESSAGE COUNT
    10  CHARACTERS SENT 
- Delete the ENTRY ACTION fields for options XMQSHOW, XMSUBEDIT, XMDXPROT.

15. The post-init, POST^XMYPRE, will
- Go through MailMan's security keys and ensure that the 'mutually
exclusive' keys are correct.

16. Here are DD changes:

a. MESSAGE file 3.7

- Change field 2, FORWARDING ADDRESS to fix the bulletin xref.  FileMan
thought that it was firing XM-FWD-ADDRESS-CHECKER, yet it was actually
firing XMZFWDBULL.  It now fires XM FWD ADDRESS CHANGE, a new bulletin,
which looks like the old ones, but has a better name.

                            This cross reference sends two bulletins.  
                                 
                            The first, XM FWD ADDRESS CHANGE, notifies
                            responsible individuals (belonging to the mail
                            group associated with the bulletin) that a user 
                            has changed his forwarding address.  This is
                            the "official" bulletin of this cross
                            reference.  
                                 
                            The second, XM FWD ADDRESS CHECK, is sent to
                            the user's new forwarding address as test to
                            see if the address is valid.  If it's not
                            valid, the sender (the Postmaster) will receive
                            an error message.  This bulletin has been
                            piggy-backed onto the "official" bulletin. 
                            FileMan is not aware of this.

                            This cross reference enables the site manager
                            to easily find a user who enters a bad

- Change field 3.702,6 - NETWORK PRIORITY TRANSMISSION
to expand the set of codes to add low priority, and to change the "AC" xref
from user-level to message-level.  (See item 3, above, for more info.)

                            '1' FOR HIGH PRIORITY;

            HELP-PROMPT:    How should this message be handled during 
                            transmission? 
            DESCRIPTION:    This field is used to flag messages that need
                            to be transmitted before or after all other
                            messages in a queue.  

                            Messages in the queue which are flagged as HIGH
                            priority are transmitted before all other
                            messages.  

                            Messages in the queue which are flagged as
                            REGULAR priority (default) are transmitted
                            next.  

                            Messages in the queue which are flagged as LOW
                            priority are transmitted after all other
                            messages.  

                            Messages with the same priority are transmitted
                            in IEN order, which is not necessarily the
                            order in which they appear in the transmit
                            queue.  

                            Only the POSTMASTER (or surrogate) may change
                            the priority of a message in a transmit queue. 
                            If, during a transmission, MailMan has problems 
                            with a particular message, MailMan may flag
                            that message as LOW priority, so that other
                            messages in the queue will transmit, before the
                            problem message is attempted again.  

                            Changes to message priorities can be made even
                            while a queue is being transmitted.

              Description:  This xref is used by MailMan during message
                            transmission to identify messages which should
                            be transmitted first (high priority) or last 
                            (low priority).  Messages with regular priority
                            are not xref'd.

          HELP-PROMPT:      Which protocol shall be used for TCP/IP?
          DESCRIPTION:      For TCP/IP connections, the scripts (the TEXT
                            field, 2, in the TRANSMISSION SCRIPT multiple,
                            4, of the DOMAIN file, 4.2) are ignored.

                            We identify the TCP/IP transmission scripts in
                            file 4.2 by the TYPE field, 1.2, within the
                            TRANSMISSION SCRIPT multiple.  Those whose TYPE
                            is 'SMTP', 'TCPCHAN', or null are considered
                            TCP/IP transmission scripts.

                            We can ignore the scripts, because they are
                            standard.

                            Here's an example of one for FORUM:

                            O H=DOMAIN.EXT,P=TCP/IP-MAILMAN
                            C TCPCHAN-SOCKET25-VXD

                            In this script, the TCP/IP-MAILMAN refers to
                            the communications protocol to use.  This field
                            should point to the communications protocol in
                            file 3.4 that should be used for TCP/IP
                            connections.

                            We identify the TCP/IP transmission scripts in
                            file 4.2 by the TYPE field, 1.2, within the

                            TCP/IP transmission scripts.

                            We can ignore the scripts, because they are
                            standard.

                            C TCPCHAN-SOCKET25-VXD

                            In this script, the TCPCHAN-SOCKET25-VXD refers
                            to the transmission script to use.  This field
                            should point to the transmission script in file
                            4.6 that should be used for TCP/IP connections.

NOTE: This release should be installed after hours, when user activity is at
a minimum.  Your site should be patched through MailMan patch XM*7.1*198.
It is also expected that Kernel 8.0 and FileMan 22.0 are installed and are
reasonably up-to-date (through patches XU*8.0*216 and DI*22.0*68,
respectively).  It is up to you to check this.  KIDS will not.
Installation will take approximately 5 minutes.

INSTALLATION:
NOTES:
a. This release should be installed after hours, when user activity is at a
minimum.  Your site should be patched through MailMan patch XM*7.1*198.  It
is also expected that Kernel 8.0 and FileMan 22.0 are installed and are
reasonably up-to-date (through patches XU*8.0*216 and DI*22.0*68,
respectively).  It is up to you to check this.  KIDS will not.
b. Installation will take approximately 5 minutes.
c. DSM sites running SlotMaster may see routine mapping problems with ZSLOT
users, even after disabling mapping.  Therefore, such sites should consider
the following steps:
- Shutdown ZSLOT on all nodes.
- Disable all mapped XM routines.
- Install this release.
- Enter manual edits.
- Rebuild mapped routine sets.
- Shutdown/restart all DSM configurations.
An alternative to the above steps is to disable all mapped XM routines about
a week before you load this release.  That way you wouldn't need to shutdown
ZSLOT or shutdown/restart DSM configurations.

1.  Users may NOT be on the system during installation of this release.
2.  DSM Sites: disable mapping for all MailMan routines.
3.  Retrieve the MailMan 8.0 KIDS build (XM8.KID) via FTP from one of the
    Anonymous Directories by following the instructions in the MailMan 8.0
    Release Message.
4.  On the KIDS:Installation menu, use the following option to load the
    build into a Transport Global on your system:
       Load a Distribution
 Enter a Host File: E:\INETPUB\FTPROOT\XM8.KID or USR$:[USER.NAME]XM8.KID
                    ==========================    =======================
 (How you answer the above prompt depends on the system you're on and where
 you placed the build you retrieved in the previous step.  The answers
 shown are examples only.)
5.  Users should not be on the system.
    Place TaskMan in a WAIT state.
    You may also wish to shut down HL7 filers/LLP's and other background
    tasks which may attempt to create new messages.
6.  On the Manage MailMan:Local Delivery Management menu, use the following
    option to stop the background filer:
       STOP background filer
Are you sure you want Background Filers to stop delivering mail? No// YES
                                                                      ===
&lt;&lt; Background Filers will stop soon. &gt;&gt;
7.  On the KIDS:Installation menu, use the following options to install the
    Transport Global:
       Verify Checksums in Transport Global
       Print Transport Global
       Compare Transport Global to Current System
       Backup a Transport Global

Patch XM*8.0*3

1.  NOIS: LAS-0802-62501
Test Site:  Las Vegas, NV
The communications testing routine, XMCDNT, distributed with MailMan 8.0
was an old version which does not work.  This patch provides a version
that works.

2.  This patch also adds a new field to the MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS (#4.3)
file.  You should fill it in with the DEVICE you normally use for your
TCP/IP scripts in DOMAIN (#4.2) file.  With the addition of this new field,
it is now possible to distribute new domains automatically, rather than
having you enter them manually.  Here's the new field:

STORED IN ^XMB(1,

           HELP-PROMPT:      Which device shall be used for TCP/IP?
           DESCRIPTION:      For TCP/IP connections, the physical
                             link/device to be used is usually standard -
                             some sort of NULL device.  This field is a
                             free-text pointer to that device in the DEVICE
                             (#3.5) file.

                             The device pointed to by this field will be
                             used for a TCP/IP connection if, in the DOMAIN
                             (#4.2) file, the device field is null in both
                             of the following fields:
                              - PHYSICAL LINK / DEVICE (#1.3) field of the
                             TRANSMISSION SCRIPT (#4) multiple
                              - PHYSICAL LINK DEVICE (#17) field

                             For more information, see the PHYSICAL LINK
                             DEVICE (#17) field, in the DOMAIN (#4.2) file.

           NOTES:            XXXX--CAN'T BE ALTERED EXCEPT BY PROGRAMMER

3.  Finally, this patch corrects the descriptions in two fields:
- MAIL GROUP (#3.8) file, MEMBER GROUPS (#11) field - invalid information
deleted
- DOMAIN (#4.2) file, PHYSICAL LINK DEVICE (#17) field - information about
default values corrected

NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
is at a minimum.  It has no patch prerequisites, except, of course, that
MailMan 8.0 be installed.  Installation will take less than 1 minute.

Patch XM*8.0*6

Remedy Ticket: HD 12891 / CHG 4269
Test Sites: MPI-AUSTIN, CIOFO-ALBANY

This patch contains several fixes.

1. When MailMan has tried all the scripts to transmit a queue, and the
transmission still fails, MailMan sends the postmaster a message to
notify of the problem.  This message gets bigger and bigger with
subsequent failures, because it reports on every previous failed attempt,
which can number in the 1000s.  This patch limits the message size by
reporting a maximum of 100 previous failed attempts.

2. Patch XM*8.0*1 failed to include the patch number in the second line of
routine ^XMTDL.  This patch adds it.

3. For GT.M systems, change the listener from the non-standard port 2525
to standard 25 in routine ^XMRUCX.

4. In routine ^XMR1, add a check to reject a connection if the site
attempting to connect is listed in the NETWORK SENDERS REJECTED (#4.501)
file.

NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
is at a minimum. It requires patches XM*8.0*1 and *5.

Patch XM*8.0*10

NOIS: CPH-0601-42716
Test Site: Central Plains HCS

This patch corrects the check to see if a device is a Video Terminal.
Video Terminal names *start* with "C-".  The check now reflects this.
(Previously, MailMan assumed, wrongly, that if the device name *contained*
"C-", that it was a Video Terminal.)

NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
is at a minimum. It requires MailMan patches XM*8.0*6 and XM*8.0*8.

Patch XM*8.0*2

Test Sites: Bronx, NY; Tampa, FL; Montana HCS; Altoona, PA

NOIS: BRX-0802-12085
P-MESSAGE has the following problems:
1) A calling program can't get the message number back.
2) Users aren't able to specify subject, sender, and recipients if they
queue the print.

This patch fixes these problems, which have also been mentioned in the
following E3Rs:

E3R:  5147,6405,13621
When printing to the P-MESSAGE device, perform all user interaction before
the text is put into the message, and enable users to specify P-MESSAGE
subject, sender, and recipients even if they queue the print.

E3R:  13766
When printing to the P-MESSAGE device, return the message number of the
message created.  The message number will be returned only if the calling
program has set the variable XMZBACK.  If $D(XMZBACK), then XMZ will be
set upon return, and XMZBACK will be killed.

E3R:  14895
When printing to the P-MESSAGE device, and the user has chosen to have the
message appear to be from the POSTMASTER, put the user's DUZ in the SENDER
(#1.1) field of the MESSAGE (#3.9) file.

The post-init ensures that some DIALOG (#.84) file entries which are no
longer needed are deleted.

NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
is at a minumum.  It requires MailMan patch XM*8.0*10, as well as
Kernel patches XU*8.0*162 and XU*8.0*175.

6. Edit the P-MESSAGE entries in the DEVICE (#3.5) file.
a. First, print out a copy of the P-MESSAGE entries in the DEVICE (#3.5)
   file, so you have a record of what they look like before you edit them.
   This is very important, so you can refer back to it in case you make an
   editing mistake.
b. Make sure the first 9 characters of the device name is "P-MESSAGE".  If
   it isn't, queued p-messages will not contain the requested subjects, or
   be delivered to the requested users.  Default values will be used,
   instead.
c. Edit the PRE-OPEN EXECUTE (#19.7) field of the P-MESSAGE entries in
   the DEVICE (#3.5) file, using the instructions as a *pattern*.

7. Edit the P-MESSAGE entries in the TERMINAL TYPE (#3.2) file.
a. First, print out a copy of the P-MESSAGE entries in the TERMINAL TYPE
   (#3.2) file, so you have a record of what they look like before you edit
   them. This is very important, so you can refer back to it in case you
   make an editing mistake.
b. Edit the CLOSE EXECUTE (#7) field of the P-MESSAGE entries in the
   TERMINAL TYPE (#3.2) file, using the instructions as a *pattern*.
   (Note: There may be some differences, depending on your system.)

Patch XM*8.0*16

NOIS: ISL-0303-51989
Test Site: OIFO Salt Lake

If you use the API ADDMBRS^XMXAPIG to add a remote user to a mail group
in the MAIL GROUP (#3.8) file, MailMan adds the user to the DISTRIBUTION
LIST (#3.813) multiple, instead of to the REMOTE MEMBER (#3.812) multiple.
This patch fixes that.

7.  This is a repeat of the information provided in patch XM*7.1*193.
If you use the MailMan option for transferring VistA email messages via
disk/tape to another site, you will have problems if the SEND field
setting for the TAPE entry in the Communications Protocol file is wrong.
The SEND field for the TAPE entry must be set to:

SEND: W XMSG,! ; S XMTRAN="S: "_XMSG D TRAN^XMC1
            ==
Most of the entries we have found for this don't have the ",!" following
the "W XMSG".  Without the ",!" you don't get the line feed at the end of
each line. This causes a buffer overflow when you try to receive the
message.  Please look at your entry, and edit, if necessary:

Using FileMan:

Select OPTION: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES  
               =====
INPUT TO WHAT FILE: COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL// &lt;press enter&gt;
EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// SEND
                        ====
THEN EDIT FIELD: &lt;press enter&gt;


Select COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL NAME: TAPE

8. The Kernel Systems Manual tells you how to set up HFS (Host File Server)
devices.  (In v8, Chapter 18 on Host Files is pages 229-232.)  If your site
is using an HFS device to send mail to and receive mail from another site,
your settings should deviate from the recommendations in the manual as
follows:

Using FileMan:

Select OPTION: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES  
               =====
INPUT TO WHAT FILE: COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL// DEVICE  
                                              ======
EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// ASK HOST FILE
                        ========
THEN EDIT FIELD: ASK HFS I/O OPERATION
                 =======
THEN EDIT FIELD: &lt;press enter&gt;

Select DEVICE NAME: HFS        &lt;=== Yours may be different
                    ===
ASK HOST FILE: YES//           &lt;=== Must be YES
ASK HFS I/O OPERATION: YES//   &lt;=== Must be YES

ASK HOST FILE should be set to YES, so that you will be prompted for
"HOST FILE NAME:".  The site creating the host file could accept the default
or select a name.  The site reading the host file would enter the name of
the file from the sending site.

ASK HFS I/O OPERATION should be set to YES, so that you will be prompted
"INPUT/OUTPUT OPERATION:".  The site creating the host file would answer
"NEW", and the site reading the host file would answer "READONLY".

This is what it should look like when you use the options:

Option: Sequential Media Queue Transmission [XMS-SEQ-TRANSMIT]
          
This option lets you select only those queues which have messages.  If
you can't select a queue, it either doesn't exist or it has no messages.

Select DOMAIN NAME: DOMAIN.EXT                       1 msgs

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

NOIS: MWV-0104-22303, TUC-0104-62259, MAD-0104-42234, PAL-0204-60051
Test Sites: FORUM; Martinsburg, WV; Martinez, CA; Palo Alto, CA; FO-Hines;
            Madison, WI; FO-Albany; Central Alabama HCS; Montana HCS;
            Columbus, OH

Recently, a MailMan site unwittingly acted as a relay for a non-VA site
sending a message containing the MyDoom virus to another non-VA site.  To
correct this, MailMan will no longer relay mail from a non-VA site to a
non-VA site.  This patch is about trying to prevent spammers and virus
propagators from sending their email through your site and from disguising
their messages to appear to be coming from your site.

Let's be clear here.  We're talking about when a site connects to your
site, and says, hi, I've got some messages for you.  For instance, if the
site is AOL, it will say, HELO AOL.COM.  Your site says "Hey, wassup?".
The other site says I've got a message from so-and-so, to FRED@YAHOO.COM.
Before this patch, MailMan would say, OK, and accept the message and
relay it on to FRED@YAHOO.COM.  Now, however, MailMan will say, I'm sorry
but I'm not going to relay this message and act as a stooge for you - do
it yourself.  Here's an example.  (I'm using AOL and Yahoo just because
they're familiar.  I'm not suggesting that they are part of the problem.)

11:24:48 R: HELO AOL.COM                           &lt;--- from outside site
11:24:48 S: 250 OK DOMAIN.EXT [8.0,DUP,SER,FTP]  &lt;--- through FORUM
11:24:48 Waiting for input
11:24:48 R: MAIL FROM:&lt;WILMA@AOL.COM&gt;
11:24:48 S: 250 OK Message-ID:9979753@DOMAIN.EXT
11:24:48 Waiting for input
11:24:48 R: RCPT TO:&lt;FRED@YAHOO.COM&gt;               &lt;--- to an outside user
11:24:48 S: 550 Relaying denied.                   &lt;--- No way!

If WILMA at AOL sends you a message at your site, and you want to forward
the message on to FRED@YAHOO.COM, that's fine.  This patch will not prevent
you from doing that.  That's something completely different from what this
patch is designed to prevent.

This patch adds a new bulletin which will notify the POSTMASTER any time
MailMan refuses to relay a message.  You are encouraged to add a mail group
to the bulletin to notify additional responsible persons.
Here's the bulletin:

NAME: XM RELAY ATTEMPTED           SUBJECT: Potential SPAM or VIRUS stopped
  RETENTION DAYS: 7
 MESSAGE:   A site calling itself |1| attempted to relay a message from: |3|
 to:   |2| through this site.
  
 This attempt was denied.
  
 By far the most important thing that a service provider can do to reduce
 spam or viruses is to ensure that any mail servers in operation accept only
 outgoing mail from machines within their own domains.  This prohibits SMTP
 relaying, denying spammers and virus propagators a necessary component of
 anonymity.
MAIL GROUP: POSTMASTER
 DESCRIPTION:   This bulletin is sent when MailMan prevents an outside site
 from relaying a message to an outside site through this site.
PARAMETER: 1
 DESCRIPTION:   The name of the site attempting to relay the message through
 this site.
PARAMETER: 2
 DESCRIPTION:   The intended recipient of the message.
PARAMETER: 3
 DESCRIPTION:   The envelope from of the message.

This patch adds two new fields to the MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS (#4.3) file:

STANDARD DATA DICTIONARY #4.3 -- MAILMAN SITE PARAMETERS FILE
STORED IN ^XMB(1,  (1 ENTRY)
DATA     NAME                  GLOBAL        DATA

                           '1' FOR YES;
                           '0' FOR NO;
         LAST EDITED:      FEB 09, 2004
         HELP-PROMPT:      Should message relaying be prevented?
         DESCRIPTION:      Answer YES if you want to prevent outside sites
                           from sending mail through your site to other
                           outside sites.  Spammers and Virus propagators
                           use this technique to disguise the source of
                           their mail, and to make it appear to come from
                           a trusted source, namely your site.

                           Answer NO if you want your site to act as a
                           relay site for anyone.

                           It is strongly recommended that you answer YES
                           to prevent your site from unwittingly relaying
                           destructive mail.

                           If you answer YES, you should define your
                           "inside" sites in the MY DOMAIN (field #41)
                           multiple, so that MailMan can distinguish them
                           from outside sites.

                           Note: This does NOT prevent users from
                           receiving mail from outside sites.  It also
                           does NOT prevent users from forwarding mail to
                           outside sites.  Such uses are perfectly OK.

           LAST EDITED:      FEB 09, 2004
           HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 3-30 characters in length.
           DESCRIPTION:      If you answered YES to PREVENT MESSAGE
                             RELAYING? (field #40), to stop your site from
                             relaying messages from outside sites through
                             your site to other outside sites, you may add
                             entries here, in order to define what is an
                             "inside" site, or sites whose messages your
                             site is willing to relay.

                             For example, if your site is a VA site, then
                             other VA sites are "inside" sites, and your
                             site should relay mail for them.  So, any
                             site whose domain name ends in ".DOMAIN.EXT" is
                             an "inside" site.  So VA sites should have
                             only one record in this multiple, and it
                             should be ".DOMAIN.EXT".

                             The default, if there are no entries in this
                             multiple, is your site's domain name.

                             MailMan will check the site name of any site
                             which connects to it, and identifies itself
                             in the SMTP HELO &lt;sitename&gt; command.  If the
                             sitename ends in any of the entries in this
                             multiple, then any mail coming from that site
                             through your site to other sites, will be
                             accepted and relayed onward.

                             If the sitename does not end in any of the
                             entries in this multiple, then messages will
                             only be accepted that are addressed to
                             recipients whose sitenames end in one of the
                             entries in this multiple.  Otherwise, the
                             site will receive an error message telling it
                             that relaying is denied, and messages will
                             not be accepted for relaying onward.

           CROSS-REFERENCE:  4.341^B
                             1)= S ^XMB(1,DA(1),4.1,"B",$E(X,1,30),DA)=""
                             2)= K ^XMB(1,DA(1),4.1,"B",$E(X,1,30),DA)

The post-init routine, ^XMYP24, will populate these fields for VA sites.
Specifically, PREVENT MESSAGE RELAYING? (#40) will be set to YES, and
".DOMAIN.EXT" will be added to the MY DOMAIN (#41) multiple.  Non-VA sites
will have to populate these fields manually if they want to prevent message
relaying.  Routine ^XMYP24 will be deleted once it has run.

Option XMKSP [MailMan Site Parameters] and Help Frame
XM-I-S-SITE PARAMETERS-REMOTE have been modified to include the new fields.

NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
is at a minimum. It requires patch XM*8.0*6.  This patch will take less
than one minute to install.

IMPORTANT NOTE TO NON-VA SITES:
This patch is only active for VA sites.  VA sites are sites whose domain
name ends in ".DOMAIN.EXT".  This patch will have absolutely no effect at
non-VA sites.  If you want to prevent MailMan at your non-VA site from
acting as an unwitting relay, you must edit fields 40 and 41 in file 4.3.
