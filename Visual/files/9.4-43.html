<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch is being released by Capacity Management (CM) in anticiptaion
of the national release of the Resource Usage Monitor (RUM) Version 1.0
software package.
 
This patch will not affect the current versions of the RUM software that
are running at the sites.  Therefore, all DSM, MSM and OpenM-NT sites are
instructed to install this patch.  Test sites which had a pre-release of
the RUM software should also install this patch.
 
The Capacity Management (CM) development team is removing obsolete
references to the Resource Usage Monitor (RUM) code.  CM has deemed that
these references are no longer necessary in order to monitor system
resource consumption.  The system workload data that was gleaned from the
existing code in these routines will be located within Kernel's menu
manager routines.

                        List Manager Print Problems
 
       This patch fixes a couple of problems reported by the CPRS Team.
When printing the list or printing the screen an extra page feed would
cause a blank page before printing began.  Also, when the list item is
longer than the device's column width in characters, data could be lost or
hard to read. The software now eliminates the page feed and warns the user
that the list item may be too long to print properly.
 
    This patch contains 2 routines.

Installation Instructions:
 
1.  Users are allowed on the system, and this patch may be queued.
    A "clobber" error may result if users are in these routines.
 
2.  These routines are usually mapped, so you might have to
    disable mapping on those machines that allow mapping.
 
3.  Use the "Install/Check Message" option on the PackMan menu to 
    load the package.
 
4.  On the KIDS menu use the following options:
 
     Veryify Checksums in Transport Global
     Print Transport Global (Optional)
     Compare Trasport Global to Current System
     Backup Transport Global
     Install VALM*1.0*3
 
5.  Reload mapped set if appropriate.

Patch VALM*1.0*4

NOIS: HUN-1198-20777
Test Site:  Huntington, WV
If the text contains control characters, it can mess up the printing and
cause List Manager to fail to print some lines of text.  This patch
checks text for control characters and strips any off before printing.

NOTE: Users should not be on the system during installation of this patch.
If they are using any application which uses List Manager (e.g. CPRS,
Outpatient Pharmacy, Appointment Management), they may experience a Clobber
Error.  This patch requires MailMan patch XM*7.1*50.

Test Sites:  Columbia, MO; Butler, PA; Battle Creek, MI; Wilmington, DE

Background: Patch VALM*1.0*3 introduced an error when printing directly (not
queued) to a device.  Although patch VALM*1.0*3 was subsequently marked
"entered in error", many sites did not back it out, because it also contained
some desired new features.  Patch VALM*1.0*3 remains "entered in error".

Patch VALM*1.0*5 replaces patch VALM*1.0*3.  It corrects the errors and
retains the desired features introduced in patch VALM*1.0*3.
When printing a list (PL) or printing a screen (PS):
  - Do not eject an extra blank page before starting the print.
  - If the list item width is greater than the device width, print a warning
    message.

NOTE: Users should not be on the system during installation of this patch.
If they are using any application which uses List Manager (e.g. CPRS,
Outpatient Pharmacy, Appointment Management), they may experience a Clobber
Error.  This patch requires patch VALM*1.0*1.

INSTALLATION:
NOTE: Users should not be on the system during installation of this patch.
If they are using any application which uses List Manager (e.g. CPRS,
Outpatient Pharmacy, Appointment Management), they may experience a Clobber
Error.  This patch requires patch VALM*1.0*1. 
1.  Users should NOT be on the system during installation of this patch.
2.  DSM Sites: If any of these routines is mapped, disable mapping for the 
    affected routine(s).  
3.  On the PackMan menu, use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option.  This loads 
    the patch into a Transport Global on your system.
    If it loads, go on to step 4.
    If you get the following error message:
**INSTALL ABORTED** Patch VALM*1.0*1 is Required to install this package!!
VALM*1.0*5 Build will not be installed, Transport Global deleted! 
    and you are sure that you have installed VALM*1.0*1, you probably need
    to use FileMan to edit the package entry as follows.  (This problem was
    caused because VALM*1.0*1 was released without a package file link.)

Patch VALM*1.0*6

NOIS: ZZZ-1200-N0512
Test Site:  FORUM, CPRS

Recognize up-arrow so that the user can exit help text smoothly.

Also, List Manager no longer calls its Date/Time or string manipulation
APIs.  Instead, it calls the equivalent Kernel APIs.  (The ListManager
APIs have not been changed at all.)  Although these APIs will continue
to be supported, applications which use them might consider switching
to the standard Kernel APIs, too.

The following are the ListManager APIs which are no longer called,
along with their Kernel equivalents:

ListManager           Kernel
-----------           ------
$$FDATE^VALM1(X)      $$FMTE^XLFDT(X,"2D")
$$FTIME^VALM1(X)      $$FMTE^XLFDT(X)
$$FDTTM^VALM1(X)      $$FMTE^XLFDT(X,2)
$$NOW^VALM1()         $$FMTE^XLFDT($$NOW^XLFDT)
$$UPPER^VALM1(X)      $$UP^XLFSTR(X)
$$LOWER^VALM1(X)      no equivalent - too esoteric

NOTE: Users should not be on the system during installation of this patch.
If they are using any application which uses List Manager (e.g. CPRS,
