<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch PSN*3.18*4 serves two purposes. First, it will put back
a VA Product Name in the VA PRODUCT NAMES multiple (#50.68) of NATIONAL
DRUG file (#50.6) which was inadvertently missing in National Drug File
(NDF) V. 3.18. It will put two entries in the DRUG INGREDIENTS file
(#50.416) and will re-index the appropriate entries in files NATIONAL DRUG
(#50.6), DRUG INGREDIENTS (#50.416), and DRUG INTERACTIONS (#56). The
second problem this patch will fix will be to reset the third and fourth
pieces of each multiple level in 50.6 to prevent possible NDF matching
errors.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch corrects several problems.
 
 1. An error may occur when using the Pharmacy Data Management (PDM)
 Drug Enter/Edit option [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT]. The routine PSNSTCK was not
 cleaning up all local variables.
 
 2. This patch also corrects a possible error in a few cases when using
 the Inquire to VA Product Info For Local Drug option [PSNLOOK]. The
 routine PSNLOOK was not checking properly for the (non)existence of data.
 
 3. This patch adds help text when selecting a National Drug Code (NDC)
 using the option NDC/UPN Inquiry [PSNUPN].
 
 4. The option Local Formulary Report [PSNFRMLY] was leaving the variable
 DIR defined upon exit. This could cause erroneous prompts under certain
 circumstances. This patch eliminates that problem.

1. Entries in the local DRUG file (#50) can be matched to the National Drug
   File VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) by selecting an entry in that file or by
   selecting an entry from the NDC/UPN file (#50.67). If the entry in either
   file is inactive, the current dialog is misleading. It appears that a match
   has been found, but in actuality it does not. This patch will affect the
   following options:
 
     - The Rematch / Match Single Drugs [PSNDRUG] option in NDF.
     - The Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option in Pharmacy Data
       Management (PDM) as this option calls those routines through
       supported DBIA # 2080.
 
 2. Currently the Inquire to National Files [PSNACT] option, does not
    display any information regarding the inactivation date of the VA
    PRODUCT file (#50.68) entries and the NDC/UPN file (#50.67) entries.
    The display of the inactivation date is now included in this patch.

When using the Patients on Specific Drug(s) [PSJ PDV] option of the
Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 package for a given VA Class, the generated
report did not have all drugs included. This was due to bad "AOC"
cross-reference associated with the VA CLASSIFICATION field (#2) in the
DRUG file (#50) which is not maintained properly by the National Drug File
(NDF) package. This patch fixes this problem.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch adds a cross-reference to the PRIMARY INGREDIENT field (#2)
in the DRUG INGREDIENTS file (#50.416).  This patch also corrects the
incorrectly set APS cross-reference in that file and the APD cross-
reference in the DRUG INTERACTION file (#56).
 
This patch also corrects two problems.
  
 1.  Under certain circumstances, the APS cross-reference on the PRIMARY
 INGREDIENT field (#2) in the DRUG INGREDIENTS file (#50.416) was not
 being properly set.  This caused the APD cross-reference on the
 INGREDIENT 1 field (#1) and the INGREDIENT 2 field (#2) in the DRUG
 INTERACTION file (#56) to be improperly set.  Certain interactions
 were not being properly tracked.
  
 This patch corrects that defect.  It also includes a post-install
 routine to reset existing cross-references.
  
 2.  In the data update patch PSN*4*53, the units for the VA Product
 INTERFERON BETA-1B,RECOMBINANT 9.6 MILLION UNT/VIL INJ (entry number
 11809 in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68)) was changed.  This should have
 caused all entries in the DRUG file (#50) matched to that product to
 be unmatched.  That unmatching did not take place.  This patch causes
 that unmatching.
  
After the patch is installed, the routines PSNJP54 and PSNOP54 should
be run from programmer mode. These routines will generate list of
patients who received combinations of drugs which should have caused
an interaction warning but did not.  These routines MUST be run
within 60 days of the install of this patch,  Once the routines have
been run, they may be deleted.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Patch PSN*4*54 creates a list of combinations of drug products that should
have generated an interaction warning but did not. Routine PSNJP54 is
included in PSN*4*54 to generate a report of patients who may have been at
risk.
Sites have reported an error that may occur during the execution of this
report. The code responsible for the potential error may also display
incorrect schedule types for IV orders. This patch corrects both of these
issues.
 
** PSNJP54 must be run within 45 days of the installation of PSN*4*54. **
 
Routine PSNJP54 should be run from programmer mode after this patch is
installed. The user will be prompted for a date to start the search and an
output format (report or spread sheet).  The default starting date for
PSNJP54 is 365 days ago. The report produces a list of patients who
received combinations of drugs that should have generated an interaction
warning but did not.
 
On a DSM system with no users and choosing the default start dates,
PSNJP54 ran in about 20 minutes. On a larger system or on a system with
many users, running time may be longer.
 
After the report has been reviewed by pharmacy personnel, PSNJP54 may be
deleted from your system.

MEDICATION INSTRUCTION SHEETS (#54.7) stored in the global PSPPI. The
new files are stored in the PS global and the seven new file numbers
range from ^PS(50.621 - ^PS(50.627. The new data source is First Data
Bank.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 1  This patch installs a new field in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68).
 The new field (#23) is named EXCLUDE DRG-DRG INTERACTION CK and is
 defined as a set of codes. This field will be used in pharmacy order
 checking to bypass drug-drug interaction checking on specific VA
 Products IN THE FUTURE. This patch does not populate the new field.
 
 2.  Under certain circumstances if an entry in the VA PRODUCT file
 (#50.68) was unmarked for CMOP, entries in the DRUG file (#50) matched
 to that item were not unmarked.  The post-install routine for this
 patch, PSN4P69P, corrects that problem.
 The post-install routine creates a mail message from NDF MANAGER with
 the subject DRUGS UNMARKED FOR CMOP which lists the items which were
 unmarked.  That message is sent to the mail group NDF DATA, holders of
 the PSNMGR security key, and the person installing the patch.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Strategic Healthcare Group in
collaboration with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), requested
the development of the first Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) VistA pilot
project, named Electronic Prescription Order Entry for Schedule II
Controlled Substances. The objective is to develop an electronic order
entry system for Schedule II controlled substances using digital
signatures. To make this project viable, modifications to the following
packages were identified:
National Drug File (NDF) V. 4.0
Kernel V. 8.0
Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0
Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0
Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) V. 7.0
Controlled Substances (CS) V. 3.0
 
The National Drug File data update patches PSN*4*64 and PSN*4*66 assign a
CS Federal Schedule to controlled substances and identify controlled
substances as narcotics or non-narcotics by populating the CS FEDERAL
SCHEDULE field (#19) of the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68).
 
This is the NDF patch that provides the following new functionalities:
 
1. This patch includes the Data Dictionary (DD) changes for CS FEDERAL
SCHEDULE field (#19) of the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68)
 
2. When using the Merge National Drug File Data Into Local File
[PSNMRG] option, the software will now check to see if the CS FEDERAL
SCHEDULE field (#19) of the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) has data and the DEA,
SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file (#50) does not have data. If both
are true, then the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field will be populated with the CS
FEDERAL SCHEDULE code mapped to the corresponding DEA, SPECIAL HDLG code
using the following table:
 
                         CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE     DEA, SPECIAL HDLG Code
Schedule I narcotics            1                        1
Schedule II narcotics           2                       2A
Schedule II non-narcotics      2n                       2C
Schedule III narcotics          3                       3A
Schedule III non-narcotics     3n                       3C
Schedule IV narcotics           4                        4
Schedule V narcotics            5                        5
 
3. This patch ensures that the newly populated CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE field
(#19) of the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) is also included as part of the
National Drug file details in Inquire to National Files [PSNACT], NDF
Info From Your Local Drug File [PSNRPT], Verify Matches [PSNVFY] and
Verify Single Match [PSNVER] options.
 
4. When using Rematch / Match Single Drugs [PSNDRUG] option, if the CS
FEDERAL SCHEDULE field (#19) of the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) and the DEA
SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file (#50) have a discrepancy, then
this patch displays a warning message, "The CS Federal Schedule associated
with this drug in the VA Product file represents a DEA, Special Handling
code of XX", where XX is the CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE code mapped to the
corresponding DEA SPECIAL HDLG code using the table listed under item 2.

This patch also creates ^XTMP("PSNINT") that contains a list of
combinations of products that should have generated an interaction
warning but did not.  The size of ^XTMP("PSNINT) is about 120 DSM blocks.
 
A subsequent patch will be created which will data in ^XTMP to generate
lists of patients who had received combinations of orders which should
have caused an interaction warning but did not.

 There are three patches that support the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation
 Interface project. These patches should be installed separately in the
 following order:
                   PSO*7*156      Outpatient Pharmacy
                   PSS*1*82       Pharmacy Data Management
                   PSN*4*84       National Drug File
 
 They contain routines, templates, options, and data dictionary changes to
 implement the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface features. Please
 refer to the individual patch description of the other patches to get the
 names of the documentation files.
 
 Each patch will share the same starting description with more detail
 for each patch in the corresponding namespace patch number.  There is
 only one installation guide.  It can be found on the anonymous 
 directory.  The name of the installation guide is PSO_7_P156_IG.PDF.
 
 The patch enhances the current Health Level Seven (HL7) interface to
 ensure that the interface is compatible with all current Outpatient
 Pharmacy V. 7.0 automation systems used by the Veterans Affairs
 Medical Centers (VAMCs).  The current national VISTA HL7 interface is
 written to HL7 standard V. 2.2.  Automated dispensing systems, such as
 the Baker APS Pharmacy 2000, are currently using an interface written to
 V. 2.3.1. standard using locally developed software.  The automated
 dispensing systems have committed to be HL7 V. 2.4 compliant.
 
 This patch includes the following new features:
 1.  Enhance the current National Drug File V. 1.0 package HL7 interface
     to the current HL7 V. 2.4 standard.
 
 2.  The interface transmits drug data to multiple vendor systems
     utilized by VAMCs whenever the following options are selected:
     A.  Rematch / Match Single Drugs [PSNDRUG] option.
     B.  Merge National Drug File Data Into Local File [PSNMRG] option.

product, any direct M-based global reads or writes to these files must be
replaced by calling the API's provided in this patch.
 
When the new data source is in place, the calling applications will not 
be required to make any changes, because these API's will be flexible 
enough to retrieve the requested data from the vendor product, when the 
time comes.
 
These are the files that are affected. If any application is making 
direct global reads or writes to any of these files, they must be 
replaced by using the API's exported with this patch.

This patch provides updates to data in several of the files associated
with the National Drug File (NDF) application.
 
This patch generates three mail messages.  All are sent from NDF MANAGER
and all are sent to members of the NDF DATA mail group, holders of the
PSNMGR security key, and the person installing the patch.  The first
message, with the subject DATA UPDATE FOR NDF, lists new products,
CMOP ID (if one exists), dispense units, and associated NDCs,
products for which the national formulary indicator has changed,
products that have been unmatched from CMOP, and products for which
the national formulary restriction has changed.  The second,
with the subject UPDATED INTERACTIONS, lists interactions that
have been added, edited, or inactivated. The third, with the subject
DRUGS UNMATCHED FROM NATIONAL DRUG FILE, lists entries in the DRUG file
(#50) which have been unmatched from NDF.

This patch contains updated Application Program Interfaces (APIs) that 
will be used by calling applications that currently do direct global 
reads or writes to the National Drug File files.  A review of the 
previously released APIs showed several entry points where additional 
pieces of data were required to be returned.
 
If you have already made code modifications, or have made plans to make
code modifications to use any of the new APIs, please check the latest
version of the API manual to verify that the API(s) in question have an
Active status. The API manual has been modified since the original version
to indicate Active and Inactive APIs. If the API(s) you need have an
Inactive status, please contact the Pharmacy Re-Engineering team at the
Birmingham Field Office.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
1. Under certain circumstances the APD cross-reference in the DRUG
INGREDIENT file (#50.416) was not being properly set.  This patch remedies
that defect and creates those entries which were not properly set in the
past.
 
2. It has been noted that some sites have made local entries to the DRUG
INGREDIENT file.  This should not have been done.  While this was not the
proximal cause of the problem noted in item 1, it may have exacerbated the
problem.  Some of these locally added ingredients may have been
overwritten by nationally entered ingredients.
This patch modifies the data dictionary of this file so that local
entries can no longer be made.
 
3. It has also been noted that over 1250 entries in the DRUG INTERACTION
file (#56) involving these locally added ingredients have been added.
If the locally added ingredients have been overwritten, these interactions
will be interactions involving the national ingredients.
 
Sites are strongly urged to review locally added interactions to verify
that they have not been changed.  Sites are also strongly urged to
inactivate any interactions involving local ingredients.  Finally, sites
are urged to review any allergies entered for drug ingredients to verify
that they have not been changed.

 IMPORTANT
 This patch must be installed immediately after patch PSN*4*95 and PSN*4*97 
 are installed. All three patches should be installed at the same time and 
 in sequence.
 
 The names of several entries in the VA DRUG CLASS file (#50.605) have been
 changed.  Other entries in this file have been inactivated and replaced
 with new entries.  This patch makes corrections to several files in multiple
 applications that use the VA DRUG CLASS file (#50.605).
 
 The patch will correct entries in the DRUG file (#50) so that the VA 
 CLASSIFICATION field (2) matches the entry in the NATIONAL DRUG CLASS 
 field (#25).
  
 The patch also updates pointers in the PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8),
 the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82) so that allergy relationships created prior
 to the NDF DATA Update PSN*4*95 continue to function correctly and display
 warnings appropriately.
 
 The patch updates the FH SITE PARAMETERS file (#119.9). Entries in the 
 DRUG CLASSIFICATIONS field (85) will be updated so that they link to the 
 appropriate entry in the VA DRUG CLASS file (50.605) after installation of
 the NDF Data Update PSN*4*97.
 
 
 The patch updates the REMINDER EXTRACT SUMMARY file (#810.3), the REMINDER 
 TERM file (#811.5), and the REMINDER DEFINITION file (#811.9).  Changes in
 PSN*4*99 ensure that relationships created prior to installation of the NDF 
 Data Update Patch PSN*4*95 continue to function appropriately after 
 installation of the NDF Data Update patch PSN*4*97.
  
 This patch generates a mail message with the subject DRUG CLASS CHANGES
 from NDF MANAGER.  This message lists drugs for which the class was changed
 and the old class and the new class.  This message is delivered to members
 of the NDF DATA mail group, holders of the PSNMGR security key, and the
 person installing the patch.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
 
It has been noted that several sites have made local entries in the DRUG
INGREDIENTS file (#50.416).  This should not have been done.  Patch
PSN*4*89 changed the data dictionary of that file to prevent further
additions.  Some of these local entries may have already been overwritten
by national entries.
 
It has also been noted that some sites have added local entries in the
DRUG INTERACTION file (#56) involving these locally added ingredients.
If the locally added ingredients have been overwritten, these interactions
will check for ingredients other than those indicated by the name of the
interaction.
 
This patch performs six functions.
 
1.  It creates a new style cross-reference on the NAME field (#.01) and the
    PRIMARY INGREDIENT field (#2) of the DRUG INGREDIENTS file (#50.416). 
    This new cross-reference replaces the old "P" cross-reference on the
    NAME field (#.01). The "P" cross reference was not working properly
    and included entries that should not have been referenced. This
    corrects the Patient Safety Issue PSI-05-008.
 
2.  Any entries in the DRUG INGREDIENTS file (#50.416) with an internal
    entry number (IEN) greater than that of the last nationally entered
    ingredient will be deleted. These would be locally entered ingredients
    that would eventually be overwritten with national ingredients released
    with NDF Data Updates.
 
3.  Any entries in the DRUG INTERACTIONS file (#56) which have ingredients
    pointing to these deleted locally entered ingredients will be deleted.
 
4.  Any entries in the DRUG INTERACTIONS file (#56) which point to ingredients
    other than those indicated by the name will be deleted. These would 
    be interactions created with a locally entered ingredient that was
    subsequently overwritten by a national ingredient.
 
5.  A mail message with the subject INGREDIENTS AND INTERACTIONS DELETED
    will be sent from NDF MANAGER to members of the mail group NDF DATA,
    holders of the PSNMGR security key, and the person installing the
    patch.  This message lists deleted ingredients, interactions deleted
    because they pointed to deleted ingredients, and interactions which
    pointed to ingredients other than those indicated in the name.  In
    the last case, both the name (containing the original ingredients)
    and the current ingredients are displayed.
 
6.  The GMR ALLERGY field (#1) and the DRUG INGREDIENT field (#.01)
    of the DRUG INGREDIENTS multiple field (#2) in the PATIENT ALLERGIES file
    (#120.8) and the DRUG INGREDIENT field (#.01) of the DRUG INGREDIENTS
    multiple field (#2) in the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82) point to the
    DRUG INGREDIENTS file (#50.416).  Any entries in these fields that
    point to ingredients that were deleted as described in item 2 above
    will be deleted.  In addition, the selection of drug ingredients in the
    PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8) should allow the selection of only
    primary ingredients.  Any entries that point to ingredients that are
    not primary ingredients will be repointed to the proper primary
    ingredient.

the DRUG INTERACTION file (#56) were not properly deleted.  This has
caused some problems with the installation of day update patch PSN*4*114.
This patch corrects that problem.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This NATIONAL DRUG FILE (NDF) patch is part of the Patient Financial
Services System (PFSS) project. PFSS patches are being released on various
schedules. Some patch functionality will not be active until a new PFSS
switch is activated during final implementation. PFSS will initially be
implemented at select pilot sites ONLY.
 
The purpose of the PFSS project is to prepare the Veterans Health
Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment for
the implementation of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) billing
replacement system. The project consists of the implementation of the
billing replacement system, business process improvements, and
enhancements to VistA to support integration with the COTS billing
replacement system. Significant changes to VistA legacy systems and
ancillary packages are necessary.
 
Some of the PFSS software components are not operational until the PFSS
On/Off Switch, distributed with patch IB*2*260, is set to "ON". The
ability for the local site to set the switch to "ON" will be provided at
the appropriate time with the release of a subsequent Integrated Billing
patch.
 
For more information about the PFSS project, review the documentation
accompanying this patch and refer to the following website:
http://vista.domain.ext/billreplace/.
 
 
Functional Description:
=======================
The Charge Description Master (CDM) is an industry standard financial tool
common to all commercial billing systems and used in virtually every
private hospital. The CDM is a comprehensive listing of all services
performed, drugs supplied, or supplies provided in a particular hospital
along with the value of those services/drugs/items, or charge amounts.
Each of these entries are represented by a Charge Code, and the Charge
Code is made up of a Department Code and Service Code. The Charge Code for
Pharmacy will be the Department Code 160 concatenated with the assigned
Service Code for the drug. The Department Code 160 will not be stored in
any files and the Service Code will be established/approved by a central
CDM Change Control Board (CCB). The implementation of the COTS billing
system requires the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) to link the service master
Service Code to every Pharmacy prescription fill or refill. Pharmacy will
create and populate a Service Code (in the 600,001 - 699,999 range) for
each entry in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68). Initially, the Service Code
will be populated by this patch and subsequently the CDM CCB assigned
Service Codes will be distributed as data update patches within the NDF
releases.
 
 
Technical Description:
======================
This NDF patch PSN*4*103 provides the following functionality needed to
support the PFSS project:
 
1. A new SERVICE CODE field (#2000) was added to the VA PRODUCT file
   (#50.68).
2. A Post-install routine that initially populates the new SERVICE
   CODE field (#2000) for every entry in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) with
   a six digit number to be within the range 600001-699999. The logic
   comprises of the Internal Entry number (IEN) padding it with zeroes as
   needed and adding a "6" on the front to make up a six digit number.

This patch provides updates to data in several of the files associated
with the National Drug File (NDF) application.
This patch generates three mail messages.  All are sent from NDF MANAGER
to members of the NDF DATA mail group, holders of the PSNMGR security 
key, and the person installing the patch.  The first message, with the
subject DATA UPDATE FOR NDF, lists new products, CMOP ID (if one exists),
dispense units, and associated NDCs, products for which the national
formulary indicator has changed, products that have been unmatched from
CMOP, and products for which the national formulary restriction has
changed.  The second, with the subject UPDATED INTERACTIONS, lists
interactions that have been added, edited, or inactivated. The third, with
the subject DRUGS UNMATCHED FROM NATIONAL DRUG FILE, lists entries in the
DRUG file (#50) which have been unmatched from NDF.

G.NDF SUPPORT@ISCPNDF.ISC-BIRM.DOMAIN.EXT.  During the period 26 October 2006
through 27 February 2007, a problem with the network configuration caused
these messages not to be transmitted.  This problem has been corrected.
This patch transmits a list of all interactions that were entered locally
during that time period.  That list is also send to members of the
NDF DATA mail group, holders of the PSNMGR security key, and the
installer of the patch.
NOTE: The message is not sent across the network from a test account.  It
is sent only to local recipients.

This patch provides updates to data in several of the files associated
with the National Drug File (NDF) application.
This patch generates four mail messages.  All are sent from NDF MANAGER
to members of the NDF DATA mail group, holders of the PSNMGR security 
key, and the person installing the patch.  The first message, with the
subject DATA UPDATE FOR NDF, lists new products, CMOP ID (if one exists),
dispense units, and associated NDCs, products for which the national
formulary indicator has changed, products that have been unmatched from
CMOP, and products for which the national formulary restriction has
changed.  The second, with the subject UPDATED INTERACTIONS, lists
interactions that have been added, edited, or inactivated. The third, with
the subject DRUGS UNMATCHED FROM NATIONAL DRUG FILE, lists entries in the
DRUG file (#50) which have been unmatched from NDF.  The fourth, with the
subject INTERACTIONS and ALLERGIES UPDATED, lists interactions and allergies
which have been changed because they were created with ingredients that
are no longer primary ingredients.

This patch creates a protocol, PSN NEW CLASS, which will be invoked during a
data update if any entries in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) have
been assigned a new VA DRUG CLASS.
 
The protocol will be used to update ancillary applications when a change
is made to the VA Drug Class assigned to a VA Product.
 
The protocol also sends a message titled "Products with changed classes" to
holders of the PSNMGR key, members of the NDF DATA mail group, and the
installer of the update.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch enhances the functionality of two components (DIC and IX) in
the PSNDI routine.
 
PSNDI is an existing API (Application Programmer Interface) for 
replicating FileMan calls.  Prior to this patch, this API supported these
files:
  
         DRUG INGREDIENTS (#50.416)
         DRUG INTERACTION (#56)
         VA DRUG CLASS (#50.605)
 
This patch adds these two files to the supported file list:
          
         NDC/UPN (#50.67)
         VA GENERIC (#50.6)
 
Inactivation Date screening logic for the standardized files (DRUG 
INGREDIENTS (#50.416), VA GENERIC (#50.6), and VA DRUG CLASS (#50.605))
will now use the SCREEN^XTID call, which utilizes the VUID inactivation
date.  The  Inactivation Date screening for the non-standardized files
(NDC/UPN (#50.67) and DRUG INTERACTION (#56)) will be based on their
VistA inactivation date fields. Prior to this patch, the screening for the
DRUG INGREDIENTS (#50.416) File was based on the VistA inactivation date
field, and prior to this patch there was no Inactivation Date screening 
for the VA DRUG CLASS (#50.605) file.
 
For further information regarding this API, please see FORUM DBIA (Data 
Base Integration Agreement) 4554.
 
**NOTE** These APIs kill DIC("S") upon entry.  Also, DIC("S") will remain
defined after a call if the calling application passes in an inactive
date.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-17.html">USER,SEVENTEEN</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch is being released in conjunction with Pharmacy Data Management
patch PSS*1.0*129. Together, these patches provide the functionality
needed to prepare for the release of Pharmacy Re-Engineering (PRE) V. 0.5,
which will change the current Pharmacy Order Checking system from using
the data stored in VistA to using data from the First DataBank (FDB)
commercial database system. All of the new functionality needed to do the 
set-up work is included in patch PSS*1.0*129. The PSS*1.0*129 patch also 
references the documentation needed for the set-up work.
 
This patch makes some changes to the National Drug File package that must 
be in place prior to the install of patch PSS*1.0*129. The National Drug
File changes included in this patch are:
 
1) Exports the Data Dictionary for the new OVERRIDE DF DOSE CHK EXCLUSION
   (#31) Field of the VA PRODUCT (#50.68) File.
2) Populates the new OVERRIDE DF DOSE CHK EXCLUSION (#31) Field of the
   VA PRODUCT (#50.68) File with data.
3) Modifies the PSNAPIS Application Programmer Interface (API) to return
   data from the new OVERRIDE DF DOSE CHK EXCLUSION (#31) Field of the
   VA PRODUCT (#50.68) File. A new OVRIDE Line Tag has been added to
   return this information. See Database Integration Agreement (DBIA) 2531
   for more information.
4) Modifies the INQUIRE TO VA PRODUCT INFO FOR LOCAL DRUG [PSNLOOK] option
   and the INQUIRE TO NATIONAL FILES [PSNACT] option to display the data
   in the new OVERRIDE DF DOSE CHK EXCLUSION (#31) Field of the VA PRODUCT
   (#50.68) File. If the value of the new field is "YES", a message will
   be displayed to inform the user of the override significance. This
   field works in conjunction with the new EXCLUDE FROM DOSAGE CHECKS
   (#11) Field of the DOSAGE FORM (#50.606) File, which is being released
   in patch PSS*1.0*129.
5) This patch makes these corrections to the INQUIRE TO VA PRODUCT
   INFO FOR LOCAL DRUG [PSNLOOK] option:
     a) Sometimes the Active Ingredients would not display.
     b) When the Active Ingredients did display, the Strength
        that displayed next to the Active Ingredient was not the
        Strength of the Active Ingredient, it was the Strength
        of the VA Product.
     c) The Drug Unit was not always displaying.
     d) Only the CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE code was displaying, and not
        the text.
     e) When displaying the Active Ingredients, the text (Primary)
        will no longer display next to an Active Ingredient that is a
        Primary Ingredient, and the Primary Ingredient will now display
        if the Ingredient of the VA Product has a Primary Ingredient.
6) This patch makes these corrections to the Inquire to National Files 
   [PSNACT] option:
     a) Only the CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE code was displaying, and not
        the text.
     b) The National Formulary Restriction display was being truncated
        after one line if was two or more lines in length.

This patch generates four mail messages.  All are sent from NDF MANAGER
to members of the NDF DATA mail group, holders of the PSNMGR security 
key, and the person installing the patch.  The first message, with the
subject DATA UPDATE FOR NDF, lists new products, CMOP ID (if one exists),
dispense units, and associated NDCs, products for which the national
formulary indicator has changed, products that have been unmatched from
CMOP, and products for which the national formulary restriction has
changed.  The second, with the subject UPDATED INTERACTIONS, lists
interactions that have been added, edited, or inactivated. The third, with
the subject DRUGS UNMATCHED FROM NATIONAL DRUG FILE, lists entries in the
DRUG file (#50) which have been unmatched from NDF.  The fourth, with the

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
1.  National Drug File data update patches make a call to an ADVERSE REACTION
TRACKING routine, UPDATE^GMRAUTL2, to update the PATIENT ALLERGIES file
(#120.8) when entries in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) are assigned to a
new class.  Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacies (CMOPs) typically do
not have the ADVERSE REACTION TRACKING application installed, so this call
generates a &lt;NOROUTINE&gt; error.  It causes no problems with the update
process but it is an irritation.  This patch adds a check before
calling this routine.
 
2.  In some cases, the header node of the ACTIVE INGREDIENTS multiple
field (#14) in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) was not being set.  This
patch sets those nodes.
 
3.  The write and delete protection on the DRUG UNITS file (#50.607) was
not set.  This patch sets those protections.

field as part of the monthly NDF Data Update patches. 
 
This patch also adds a new option, Display FDA Medication Guide
[PSN MED GUIDE], to the National Drug File Menu [PSNMGR].
 
This patch also creates a new application programmer interface (API) for the
National Drug File application (NDF) to return an FDA Medication Guide link.
The call is S &lt;variable&gt;=$$FDAMG^PSNAPIS(ien).
 
This patch also provides a new Remote Procedure Call that will be used by
subsequent Outpatient Pharmacy and NDF functions to display FDA Medication
Guides.  The functions to utilize the new RPC will be provided in patches
planned for release at a later date.  The RPC is named
PSN FDA MED GUIDE PRINT QUEUE.

This patch is being released in preparation for the Supra-Therapeutic
Dosages project. It contains the following 3 new fields that are being

1. CREATE DEFAULT POSSIBLE DOSAGE field (#40)
 
   Field Description:
   -----------------
   Indicate whether Possible Dosages should be auto-created based on
   Dosage Form/Dispense Unit (Default) or if you want to control the
   Possible Dosage auto-creation process for the Dispense Drugs
   matched/re-matched to this VA Product.
 
   YES - Possible Dosages will be auto-created based upon Dosage
         Form/Dispense Unit combination (Default).
    NO - Possible Dosages will be auto-created according to the rule set
         by the POSSIBLE DOSAGES TO CREATE (#41) and PACKAGE (#42) fields.
 
2. POSSIBLE DOSAGES TO CREATE field (#41)
 
   Field Description:
   -----------------
   Indicate which Possible Dosages or if no Possible Dosages should be
   auto-created for Dispense Drugs matched/re-matched to this VA Product.
   This field is used only if the CREATE DEFAULT POSSIBLE DOSAGE field
   (#40) is set to 'NO'.
 
       N - No Possible Dosages are auto-created for Dispense Drugs matched
           to this VA PRODUCT entry during the match/re-match process.
       O - Only 1x Possible Dosage is auto-created for Dispense Drugs
           matched to this VA PRODUCT entry during the match/re-match
           process.
       B - Both 1x and 2x Possible Dosages are auto-created for Dispense
           Drugs matched to this VA PRODUCT entry during the
           match/re-match process.
 
3. PACKAGE (#42)
 
   Field Description:
   -----------------
   Indicate the Package(s) use for the Possible Dosage(s) auto-created.
   This field is used only if the CREATE DEFAULT POSSIBLE DOSAGE field
   (#40) is set to 'NO' and the POSSIBLE DOSAGES TO CREATE field (#41) is
   either set to 'O' or 'B'.
 
      I  - Possible Dosages auto-created for Dispense Drugs
           matched/re-matched to this VA PRODUCT entry will be available
           for the Inpatient application only.
      O  - Possible Dosages auto-created for Dispense Drugs
           matched/re-matched to this VA PRODUCT entry will be available

           matched/re-matched to this VA PRODUCT entry will be available
           for both, Inpatient and Outpatient applications.
 
In addition, a post-install routine will run to update the CREATE DEFAULT
POSSIBLE DOSAGE field (#40) for every entry in the VA PRODUCT file 
(#50.68) with the default value of YES. The post-install routine will be
automatically deleted from the system upon completion of the installation.
 
Updates to these new fields will happen automatically via the monthly
National Drug File (NDF) Data Update patches.

formulary indicator has changed, products that have been unmatched from
CMOP, and products for which the national formulary restriction has
changed.  The second, with the subject UPDATED INTERACTIONS, lists
interactions that have been added, edited, or inactivated. The third, with
the subject DRUGS UNMATCHED FROM NATIONAL DRUG FILE, lists entries in the
DRUG file (#50) which have been unmatched from NDF.  The fourth, with the

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch contains software modifications to the National Drug File (NDF)
V. 4.0 application to support the FDA Medication Guides project. The 
project objective is to allow pharmacy staff to retrieve the FDA Medication 
Guide for prescription items that contain FDA approved information that
can help patients avoid adverse events. The FDA requires that Medication
Guides be included with certain prescribed drugs and biological products 
when the Agency determines that: 
 
 . Certain information is necessary to prevent serious adverse effects 
 . Patient decision-making should be advised by information about a known
   serious side effect with a product, or 
 . Patient adherence to directions for the use of a product is essential
   to its effectiveness. 
 
The features in the FDA Medication Guides project are being delivered in
incremental releases. This patch is part of the Increment 2 release. The 
features included in this release are:
 
 . Establishment of a Server Repository for FDA Medication Guides within 
   the VA network.
 
 . Updates to 900+ entries in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) to store the 
   corresponding FDA Medication Guide document name will be provided via
   the NDF Monthly Data Update patches.
 
 . Introduction of a PC based Java software component to enable the
   automatic retrieval of an FDA Medication Guide from within VistA. The
   software does not require any direct user interaction. It works as a 
   bridge between VistA and the PC where it is installed. The software 
   identifies a request from VistA for a specific FDA Medication Guide and
   automatically retrieves it from the Server Repository and displays to the
   user via the Internet Explorer browser. 
  
 . Introduction of a new option called Display FDA Medication Guide [PSN MED
   GUIDE] to the National Drug File V. 4.0 application for retrieving and 
   displaying the FDA Medication Guide for a specific VA Product.
 
 . Introduction of new functionality to the Patient Prescription Processing
   [PSO LM BACKDOOR] option in the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 application
   for retrieving and displaying the FDA Medication Guide for a specific 
   prescription.
  
Below is a list of all the applications involved in this release along
with their patch number:
  
   APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH

   OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*343
   
The FDA Medication Guides project is expected to complete in three
increments. Among other features, the next Increment will automate the
printing of FDA Medication Guides for prescriptions dispensed by the VA
via Outpatient Pharmacy application when the prescription label is printed.
   
The following modifications are included in this patch (PSN*4*263):
  
  A. FDA    Display FDA Medication Guide [PSN MED GUIDE] option
 
  Users will be able to retrieve an FDA Medication Guide for a specific VA
  Product by invoking this option. A Java software component running at the
  user's PC will then display the FDA Medication Guide Adobe Acrobat 
  document (.pdf) by automatically opening it via the user's default web
  browser, which will allow the users to print it to any printer available
  to them, as seen below:
       
  Select VA PRODUCT NAME: LINDAINE
       1   LINDANE 1% CREAM,TOP  
       2   LINDANE 1% LIQUID,TOP  
       3   LINDANE 1% LOTION  
       4   LINDANE 1% SHAMPOO  
  CHOOSE 1-4: 3  LINDANE 1% LOTION  
 
  The following URL provides the link to the FDA Medication Guide associated
  with this medication. Thin Client users: copy/paste the URL below into a
  browser to access the FDA Medication Guide for this drug:
 
  vaww.national.cmop.domain.ext/FDAMedGuides/Lindane_(Generic)_(2008).pdf
 
    [FDA Medication Guide .pdf document opens on the web browser]
  
 
  If a user tries to use this option from a computer which does not have
  the required Java software component installed, the following message
  will display:
 
  Select VA PRODUCT NAME: LINDAINE
       1   LINDANE 1% CREAM,TOP  
       2   LINDANE 1% LIQUID,TOP  
       3   LINDANE 1% LOTION  
       4   LINDANE 1% SHAMPOO

  The following URL provides the link to the FDA Medication Guide associated
  with this medication. Thin Client users: copy/paste the URL below into a
  browser to access the FDA Medication Guide for this drug:
  
  vaww.national.cmop.domain.ext/FDAMedGuides/Lindane_(Generic)_(2008).pdf
  
  Please wait... 
     
  The system is unable to display FDA Med Guide automatically.
   
  The FDA Medication Guide will not automatically open on Thin Client and some
  types of encrypted sessions. If you do not believe this is the reason contact
  your local technical support for assistance.
 
  You can copy/paste the link above into your browser's address bar to retrieve
  the FDA Medication Guide.
   
  Enter RETURN to continue, '?' for HELP, or '^' to exit: ?
 
  When unable to get the FDA Medication Guide to display, review the following
  suggestion(s) for troubleshooting potential problems:
  
  1) The browser did not open automatically. This may be due to the following:
     - You might be connected to VistA via Thin Client or an encrypted session
       that prevents the FDA Med Guide from automatically displaying. Please
       copy and paste the URL link below into your browser's address bar to
       retrieve the FDA Medication Guide:
 
   vaww.national.cmop.domain.ext/FDAMedGuides/Lindane_Lotion_(Generic)_(2008).pdf
 
     - The computer might not have the required Java software component
       installed or the software might not be functioning properly. Please,
       contact technical support for assistance.
  
  2) When doing a copy/paste of the link into the browser's address and an HTTP
     404 - File Not Found error is received. This may be due to the following:
     - A common issue exists when the link is displayed in two lines in the
       terminal screen. When you copy both lines at the same time and paste it
       into the browser's address, the second line is ignored by the browser
       resulting in a 'broken' link. To resolve this issue, copy and paste one
       line at a time from the terminal screen into the browser's address to
       make sure the complete link is used.
     - The FDA Medication Guide Server may be down at the moment. Please, wait
       a few minutes and try again. If the problem persists, contact technical
       support for assistance.
 
  3) The browser opened automatically, however you receive an HTTP 404 - File
     Not Found error. This may be due to the following:
     - The FDA Medication Guide Server may be down at the moment. Please, wait
       a few minutes and try again. If the problem persists, contact technical
       support for assistance.
   
 
  If a user tries to use this option for a medication that does not have an FDA
  Medication Guide on file, the following message will display:
 
   Select VA PRODUCT NAME: ALLO
       1   ALLOPURINOL 100MG TAB  
       2   ALLOPURINOL 100MG TAB,UD  
       3   ALLOPURINOL 300MG TAB  
       4   ALLOPURINOL 300MG TAB,UD  
       5   ALLOPURINOL NA 500MG/VIL INJ  
   CHOOSE 1-5:  1 ALLOPURINOL 100MG TAB  
      
   There is no FDA Medication Guide associated with this medication.
  
   Enter RETURN to continue, '?' for HELP, or '^' to exit: ?
 
   When unable to get the FDA Medication Guide to display, review the following
   suggestion(s) for troubleshooting potential problems:
 
   1) If no FDA Medication Guide exists for a product that you believe should
      have one, confirm that one is required by visiting the FDA website
      (www.fda.gov). If one is required, log a support ticket to request its
      addition. Please understand that there may be a delay between the time
      that a new Medication Guide is posted to the FDA website and when it is
      made available in VistA through a National Drug File data update patch.
   
 
  Note: This option requires a Java software component to be installed on
  ----  the user's computer. This software will be released as part of this
        project. Please, refer to the project Release Notes and Installation
        Guide documentation for further information.
   
 
  B. The length of the FDA MED GUIDE field (#100) in the VA PRODUCT file
     (#50.68) is being modified from 245 characters to 100 characters. The 
     field will now be used to store only the PDF file name of the FDA  
     Medication Guide rather than the complete link, which also had the web
     server URL. The web server URL is now being stored on a new field called 
     FDA MED GUIDE SERVER URL (#100) in the PHARMACY SYSTEM (#59.7) file,
     which is introduced by patch PSS*1*158.

<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2011-04-28 16:15:41</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-17.html">USER,SEVENTEEN</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses the New Service Request (NSR) #20070434 to prevent
the inadvertent creation of supra-therapeutic possible dosages for high
risk medications during dosage creation performed during the matching and
re-matching of dispense drugs to National Drug File (NDF) entries within
the Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0 application.
 
Patch PSN*4*261 has been previously released in preparation for this
project. It added the following 3 new fields to the VA PRODUCT file
(#50.68):
 
       CREATE DEFAULT POSSIBLE DOSAGE (#40)
       POSSIBLE DOSAGES TO CREATE (#41)
       PACKAGE (#42)
 
Patch PSN*4*262 is being released in conjunction with PDM patch PSS*1*155,
which has the functionality in place to determine if possible dosages
should be auto-created or not during the match/re-match process.
 
This patch contains changes to the Inquire to National Files [PSNACT]
and Inquire to VA Product Info For Local Drug [PSNLOOK] options to include
the display of the new fields. Below are some screen captures of how the
new fields will display to the screen for both options:
 
   Example #1:
         ...
 
         Override DF Exclude from Dosage Checks: No
 
         Auto-Create Default Possible Dosage? Yes
 
 
   Example #2:
         ...
         Auto-Create Default Possible Dosage? No
             Possible Dosages To Auto-Create: No Possible Dosages
 
 
   Example #3:
         ...
 
         Override DF Exclude from Dosage Checks: No
 
         Auto-Create Default Possible Dosage? No
             Possible Dosages To Auto-Create: 1x and 2x Possible Dosages
                                     Package: Inpatient
 
 
NOTE: For more information about the new fields, please refer to the patch
      PSN*4*261. For information on how the new fields affect
      auto-creation of possible dosages during match and re-match
      process, refer to patch PSS*1*155.
 
Also, this patch adds the component $$POSDOS to the routine PSNAPIS,
supported by Integration Control Registration (ICR) #2153, to retrieve the
content of these 3 new fields.
 
In addition, a post-install routine will run to update the CREATE DEFAULT
POSSIBLE DOSAGE field (#40) with the default value of "YES" for entries
added to the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) after patch PSN*4*261 was installed.
The post-install routine will be automatically deleted from the system
upon completion of the installation.

This patch generates four mail messages.  All are sent from NDF MANAGER
to members of the NDF DATA mail group, holders of the PSNMGR security 
key, and the person installing the patch.  The first message, with the
subject DATA UPDATE FOR NDF, lists new products, CMOP ID (if one exists),
dispense units, and associated NDCs, products for which the national
formulary indicator has changed, products that have been unmatched from
CMOP, and products for which the national formulary restriction has
changed.  The second, with the subject UPDATED INTERACTIONS, lists
interactions that have been added, edited, or inactivated. The third, with
the subject DRUGS UNMATCHED FROM NATIONAL DRUG FILE, lists entries in the
DRUG file (#50) which have been unmatched from NDF.  The fourth, with the

This patch is part of the Copayment enhancement project and it will be 
released along with the Integrated Billing patch IB*2*456 and the Accounts
Receivable package (PRCA*4.5*278). 
 
This patch contains changes to the Inquire to National Files [PSNACT] and 
Inquire to VA Product Info For Local Drug [PSNLOOK] options to include
the display of the new fields. Below are some screen captures of how the 
new fields will display to the screen for both options:
 
   Example #1:
         ...
         Reduced Co-pay: None 
 
   Example #2:
         ...
         Reduced Co-pay: Start Date: 01/01/2012     Stop Date: 06/30/2012
                         Start Date: 01/01/2013     Stop Date:  
 
 
Also, this patch adds the component $$REDCOP to the routine PSNAPIS, 
supported by Integration Control Registration (ICR) #2531, to return the
existence of reduced copayment for a VA Product on a given date.
 
Updates to these new fields will happen automatically via the monthly 
National Drug File (NDF) Data Update patches.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
VistA Patch PSN*4*304 released November 10, 2011 created a new VA drug 
class "AM400 QUINOLONES".  The quinolone antibiotics were previously 
located under VA drug class "AM900 ANTI-INFECTIVES,OTHER".  Existing
patient allergies in the PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8) to antibiotics 
in the quinolone class were not automatically updated to the new VA drug
classification with the release of PSN*4*304. Consequently the entry of
a new order for an antibiotic in the Quinolone VA drug class will not
trigger a drug allergy alert.
  
A facility reported that the drug-allergy order check in VistA/CPRS did
not trigger appropriately when a patient was ordered a fluroquinolone type
antibiotic that the patient had a known allergy to.  The drug allergy was
properly documented in the VistA Adverse Reaction Tracking (ART) System. 
 
This patch contains a post-install routine that will loop through all the
patient allergies entries for quinolones and will correctly update such 
entries with the new class "AM400 QUINOLONES", which should trigger the
drug-allergy order check when the patient is ordered a medication under
this drug class. Once completed, the post-install routine will generate
and send the Mailman message below to the person who installed the patch,
to the mail group 'NDF DATA' and to all the 'PSNMGR' security key holders.
 
    Subj: Post-install results from patch PSN*4*297  [#110557] 02/02/12
    From: NDF MANAGER  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Number of Patient Allergy entries by class:
  
    Before update:
    AM900 - ANTI-INFECTIVES,OTHER: 1601
    AM400 - QUINOLONES           : 11
 
    After update:

    AM400 - QUINOLONES           : 693
 
    Enter message action (in IN basket): Ignore//
 
The results above will vary from site to site. Some sites might even have
the exact same number 'Before' and 'After' the update, which means the
site had not been affected by the problem in PSN*4*304 when it was 
installed.
