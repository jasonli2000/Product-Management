Miscellaneous patch.
1) Allow users to reprint Rx's filled at CMOP facilities.
2) Fix Refill Quantities in Drug Acct
3)This patch fixes a problem that could occur after processing Rx's in the
Process Drug/Drug Interactions option. If any Rx's are processed in this
option, and the user then goes directly to the New Prescription Entry
option and enters new Rx's, a duplicate label of the Rx processed in the
Process Drug/Drug Interactions option could possibly print. This patch
fixes the problem.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses several problems reported via NOIS: 
 1) CLE-0397-41373 describes a situation where editing the QTY field (#7)
    or the QTY field (# 52.1,1 refill quantity) results in an update of
    the CURRENT INVENTORY field (#50) in the DRUG file (#50). The software
    was modified to prevent updating the CURRENT INVENTORY during edit.
 
 2) GNH-0298-42078 reports that when attempting to change the suspense
    date for a patient's Rxs using the Change Suspense Date [PSO PNDCHG]
    option, the lookup fails to find the patient's name.  The lookup
    involved did not include a necessary CMOP cross reference.  The cross
    reference has been included.
 
3)  NAN-0498-41811 depicts a condition where an Rx written for a
    controlled substance had a one year expiration date rather than the
    required limit of 6 months. A check has been inserted and the
    expiration date of 6 months is forced on controlled substances.
 
4)  A medical center using Outpatient Version 7.0 noticed that the cancel
    date from an Rx being renewed was transferred to the renewed Rx.
    Research disclosed (also for V 6.0) that this was only happening if
    the Rx being renewed was already canceled before the renewing action
    was taken. If, as is normal, the Rx status was changed to cancel
    DURING the renewing action, the cancel date was not transferred to the
    new Rx. The code was modified to delete the old cancel date during
    renewals.

PSO*7.0*1 - 1.26.97
 
PSOCLO1: A problem was reported about Clozapine Rxs and when there are
valid lab results.  The problem has to do with the lab results being
returned as zero when a number should be returned.
  
After the installation of version 7.0 in Washington's production account
a number of allocation errors begin to occur.  In an attempt to manage
the number of variables in the partition several routines have been
modified.  They are: PSOHLNE1, PSOHLNE2, PSOHLNEW, PSOHLSIG, PSOHLSIH,
PSOHLSN, PSOHLSN1, PSOORUT1, PSON52, PSORN52, and PSORN52C.
 
PSOREF: Fixed problem on speed refill of invalid Fill Date selection prompts
if the 1st Rx in the list is expired.  In this routine there's an entry
point that's used by CPRS to help determine if an Rx is refillable.
There's a potential problem when refill requests are made and the Pharmacy
Orderable Item are missing from the Rx.  In order to prevent a
possible undefined error from occurring an addition check was added to
determine if there's an orderable item is for that drug in the Rx.
 
When a refill was in suspense, some cross references were being corrupted
in the Rx Suspense File. These changes fix that problem. Also added a
cross reference to the Fill Date field. What this does is if an Original
Fill is in suspense and has not yet been printed, if the Fill Date is
edited, then we now update the suspense date with the new Fill Date.
Routines: PSOUTL, PSOUTLA. The Fill Date field (#22) in the Rx file (#52)
will be sent out in this patch.
 
Added addition code to prevent refills from being deleted when removing
Rxs from Hold,  Routines: PSOUTL, PSOHLD

This patch installs new functionality that allows the action profile to be

it too prints in an 80 column format.
Routines: PSOSD, PSOSD0, PSOSD1, PSOSD2, PSOSD3, PSOSDP, and PSODACT,
PSOBMST, PSODEDT.
 
This patch corrects a problem in the compiling of the data for the
Medication profiles.  The problem is that prescriptions that had been marked
as deleted were printing on the short and long profiles.  Routine: PSOP
 
Fixed problem of incorrect message given to user on the Listman status
bar saying "Label will Reprint due to edit!", when no data was
actually changed during the editing of the Rx, and no label will be
printed.  Routines: PSORXED, PSORXED1.
 
A NOIS was entered on the Tuscaloosa VAMC local NOIS system describing the
wording in a prompt as misleading.  The prompt appeared to allow users to 
select multiple entries.  However, this select prompt is meant to allow a 
single selection and not multiple.  The wording will be changed from 'Select 
Refill' to 'Select a Refill'.  Routine: PSOORED2.
 
When prescriptions are returned as not dispensed by CMOP Host, and edited
by Pharmacy, they are not automatically re-suspended back to CMOP for 
transmission.  Routines: PSOCMOP, PSOCMOPC, PSORXED, PSORXED1

Duplicate Drug of another Rx for that patient, and did not Discontinue
that duplicate Rx when prompted to Discontinue. Routine: PSOOREDT
 
2. Corrected a problem where a possible invalid cross reference existed.  Which
could cause an undefined error when cost data is being compiled.
Routine: PSOCSTM, PSOCSTD
 
3. Added a check to screen out pending refill order when doing order checks.

2. Fix a problem reported in NOIS SFC-0298-60679. Entering an up-arrow (^)
at the Ticket # prompt could cause an undefined error.  The software was
changed to delete the entry when an up-arrow is entered at the prompt.
The software will now display a message indicating that the "Bingo
record is incomplete!" and "Bingo record removed. Routine: PSOBING1
 
3. Fixed error reported by Puget Sound in NOIS PUG-0198-51767. An undefined
error occurred when editing a prescription that created a new
prescription, and there were no numbers left in the numbering sequence
for prescriptions. Errors could also occur if a site was manually
assigning the prescription numbers, and nothing was entered at the
"Select New Rx #" prompt when creating a new prescription due to an Edit.
Routines: PSONRXN, PSOORED1
 
4. Fixed an error reported by San Francisco, NOIS SFC-0298-60681. The
error occurred in the daily cost compilation background job. 
When the patient is accessed during the compilation routine, an error could
occur if that patient has both Outpatient and Inpatient orders to be
backfilled. After the backfilling, upon returning to the cost compilation
routine, an undefined error could occur. Routine: PSOHLUP

1. This patch fixes problems involving pulling prescriptions from suspense
to fill locally that were originally suspended for CMOP. If a prescription
is suspended for CMOP, and is pulled from suspense using the Patient
Prescription Processing option, then an up-arrow is entered when the user
is prompted for a label action, the CMOP INDICATOR field in the RX SUSPENSE
File would have been set to "P", for PRINTED LOCALLY, although the label
never printed
 
2. Another problem occurred when using the Pull Early from Suspense option.
If the routing was changed while pulling a prescription from suspense,
then a "^" was entered at the Label prompt, the original routing was
not restored to the prescription, which caused prescriptions that
were originally intended to be filled at the CMOP to be printed locally.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
1. When Controlled Rxs are renewed, the expiration date was defaulting to
one year instead of six months.  Routine: PSON52
 
2. When prescriptions are removed from Hold the user can reprint the label
if they want.  In the activity multiple events are recorded (placed on,
removed from hold).  If a label is printed the label log does not show that
the label was printed because the Rx was removed from hold.  This patch will
record in the label log that the label was printed because an Rx was removed
from hold.  Routines: PSOHLD, PSOLBLN
 
Also added a check in the routine PSOLBLN to check for the barcode on and
off sequences being defined for Rx label printing.
 
3. Added a check for site parameters being defined when using the Rx
Verification by Clerk option [PSO VR]. Routine: PSOVER
 
4. Corrected a problem where inventory deduction from the Drug file (#50)
could happen unnecessarily. Routine: PSORXED, PSORXED1.
 
5. Added a site parameter, VERIFYING PHARMACIST ON LABELS, that will allow
sites to print the Verifying Pharmacist number on the 2nd line of labels.
 
6. Fixed problem of refilling an Rx, and the refill suspending to the
original Fill Date, instead of the Refill Date. Routine PSORXED
 
7. Fixed problem of Editing a released Rx, and that Rx then suspending for
CMOP instead of suspending locally. Routine PSOCMOP.
 
8. On line 2 of the labels, the first number printed after the phone
number for CPRS entered orders has been the internal entry number of the
person entering the order in CPRS. This patch changes that number to the
person who Finishes the order in Pharmacy.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
1. Corrected problems with the nightly cost compile jobs.  The problems are
that the number of requests by patient was not being counted correctly and 
a problem with the nightly compile where data for the previous day was being
reset.  Routines: PSOCSTD, PSOCSTM
 
2. Corrected a problem with the nightly job that compiles the AMIS data. The
problem is that all partials was not being counted correctly.
Routine: PSOAMIS0
 
3. Corrected a possible problem of barcode on and off sequences being changed
and made invalid for label printers.  This could happen if a label device is
selected, then an Action Profile device is selected, and the site parameter
is set to print barcodes on action profiles.  If there are Rx labels to print
again the Barcode On and Barcode Off sequences for the Action Profile printer
become the sequences for the Label printer, which may not work if the printers
selected are different types.  Routines PSOSD, PSOSD1, PSOSDP
 
 4. Corrected a problem reported when using the Delete a Prescription
[PSO RXDL] option.  If an original fill is released, and a refill is
entered but not yet released, the user can mark the prescription as
deleted without first returning to stock the original fill. Routine PSORXDL

Fixed problem reported in Tuscaloosa, local NOIS PHA-0198-N0090. If a
reprint was done in Listman on one Rx in the Patient Prescription
Processing option, then the user finished some Rx's in the Complete
Orders from OERR option, the comments from the reprint would carry over
to the Label Log entries for the Rx's finished in the Complete option.

1. This patch will attempt to make more POSSIBLE SIGS acceptable when
finishing CPRS entered orders in Outpatient Pharmacy. It will cut down
on the number of POSSIBLE SIGS that start "TAKE TAKE", and also cut down
the number of times the Dose Form noun is repeated, "TABLETS TABLETS".
 
2. This patch fixes the problem of the last refill being deleted when an
Rx is canceled or expired, after that refill had been transmitted to the
CMOP.
 
3. This patch also fixes a problem of the Log of Suspended Rx's report not
always showing the correct routing.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. When using the Patient Record Update [PSO PATIENT RECORD UPDATE]
action, the site parameter that controls the editing of Patient
Information Management System (PIMS) patient data was being ignored.
Routine: PSOLMPAT
 
2. This patch will enable the interface between Outpatient Pharmacy
version 7.0 and the Clinical Information Resource Network (CIRN) once CIRN
is installed. There will be no change in functionality for Outpatient
Pharmacy sites that do not have CIRN installed.
 
3. Corrected a problem reported in NOIS ALB-0498-50730 associated with
the Medication Profile [PSO P] option.  The problem happens when the
report is sorted to print by Class or Medication and a cutoff date (number
of days) is entered, the Rxs that have been canceled print beyond the
selected number of days.  Routine: PSOP2
 
Corrected another problem reported in NOIS CON-0798-11780 when printing
the Med profile by a selected date range.  The problem is that when a date
range is entered the first time and the user attempts to run the report
again and chooses a date range earlier that the initial date, the user is
not allowed to do so.  Routine: PSOP1
 
4. Corrected a problem where a possible undefined error could occur when
the cross reference on the DATE OF DEATH field (#.351) on the PATIENT file
(#2) is executed.  The problem could occur when the APOSD cross reference
is executed. Routine: PSOCAN3
 
5. Added a 'Press Return to Continue' prompt when using the Speed Release
action.  The problem was when there were many Rx's to be released, the Rx
number scrolled off the screen.  For users without scroll back
capabilities, this caused users to question as to what Rx's were being
released. Routine: PSODISP3
 
6.When editing the original Fill Date of a prescription that is in
suspense and queued for Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP)
transmission, it is possible that duplicate "AQ" cross references will
exist for that suspense entry. This could cause the prescription to be
sent to the CMOP twice. In addition to fixing this problem, any invalid
"AQ" cross references will be deleted by this patch. Routines: PSOUTLA,
PSOPOST3
 
7.This patch addresses a problem reported by some sites concerning the
Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option. Currently under this
option, the site will only see Pending Outpatient orders that have a
Related Institution that matches the Related Institution for the
Outpatient Site that the user is signed in under. The problem occurs when
an order is received from Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) from a
Clinic that is related to an Institution that is not found as a Related
Institution for any of the Outpatient Pharmacy sites. When this happens,
the only way for those orders to be completed is for the user to select
that patient under the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR
ORDERS] option.
 
To fix this problem, this patch adds a new field to the OUTPATIENT SITE
file (#59) called CPRS ORDERING INSTITUTION (#8). Multiple entries can be
entered in this field. This can be done using the Site Parameter
Enter/Edit [PSO SITE PARAMETERS] option. Upon installation of this patch,
a conversion is done to move the Institution that is currently in the
Related Institution field for each Outpatient Site to the first entry in
this new field. After the installation of the patch, if there is still
only one entry in the new CPRS ORDERING INSTITUTION field (#8) for an
Outpatient Site, then the Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH]
option will not change for the user. However, sites can now enter multiple
Institutions in this field for an Outpatient Pharmacy site, and if a site
does this, the user will be prompted for an Institution when entering the
Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option. After the user selects
an Institution, then the Pending Orders that will be shown to the user for
completing will be those Pending Orders from Clinics that are associated
with that Institution selected.
 
8. A problem has been reported concerning the Order Summary that is
displayed after selecting the RX (Prescriptions) [PSO RX] option. The
first number displayed is the "Orders to be completed for all divisions".
Then the user can choose to view an order summary, which breaks down all
of the orders by Routing, (Window, Mail, and Clinic). The problem is that
the total of the "Orders to be completed for all divisions" does not
always match the total of the breakdown by routing. The reason is that not
all Renewals that are received from CPRS have an associated routing. To
resolve this, when Outpatient Pharmacy receives a Renewal from CPRS with
no routing, a Mail routing will automatically be entered for the Renewal.
This patch will also automatically update any current Pending Renewals
with no routing to a Mail routing.
 
9. This patch fixes a problem of the patient not always being displayed
on the Bingo Board automatically when using the Release Medication
[PSO RELEASE] option.
 
10. This patch provides a new sort capability when using the Complete
Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option. Orders can now be Finished by
Clinic, or by Clinic Sort Group. Within either of these sorts, orders will
be Finished on a first in/first out basis by Patient. Clinic Sort Groups
can be added/edited in the Enter/Edit Clinic Sort Groups [PSO SETUP
CLINIC GROUPS] option, which is found under the Maintenance (Outpatient
Pharmacy) [PSO MAINTENANCE] menu option.
 
11. This patch fixes a problem of a prescription showing up on the
unreleased report, when only an Interaction label printed, and not a
Filling label. If a prescription is entered before the version 7.0
install, and a Drug Interaction label printed, then version 7.0 is
installed, that prescription will show on the unreleased report, even
though a Filling label never printed.
 
12. This patch fixes an error that involves incorrect medications showing
up on a Medication profile for a patient. This can occur if there is
invalid data in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55). A patient validation
check is being added to prevent this problem. Also in the Medication
profile, an error could occur if a profile is run on a patient, and the
orders for that patient have not yet been backfilled to CPRS. This error
can only occur shortly after the installation of Outpatient Pharmacy
version 7.0.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. This patch fixes an error that can occur in the Change Suspense Date 
[PSO PNDCHG] option. When using this option, if "YES" is entered at the
"Do you want to delete Rx's from suspense for this patient" prompt, and
that patient has an unreleased refill that has printed from suspense,
an error could occur. NOIS STX-0898-71717.  
 
2. This patch exports an entry point that can be called by Computerized
Patient Record System (CPRS) during Outpatient Order Entry. Based on the
patient and the Dispense Drug selected (when applicable), Outpatient
Pharmacy can return a flag to CPRS that tells CPRS to not ask the Service
Connected question for that particular Outpatient Pharmacy order.
 
3. A new input transform for the QTY (#.04) field of the PARTIAL DATE
subfile (#52.2) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) is being sent out in this
patch. It changes a Write statement to a VA FileMan call to comply with
current standards.  
 
4. This patch corrects a problem with discontinuing multiple Rx's at one
time. NOIS CON-0698-12208.  
 
5. In the medication procedure call that returns inpatient and outpatient 
detailed information, new data elements were added.  NOIS PUG-0298-51400.
 
6. Corrected a problem with editing drugs in prescriptions and the cost
for the drug not being updated properly. NOIS TUA-0798-32558.
 
7. This patch corrects a problem of a possible incorrect CLINIC (#5)
field entry for a prescription. If a prescription is renewed from CPRS,
then Finished in Pharmacy, the Clinic for that prescription is the
original Clinic for the "Renewed from" prescription, but is should be the
Clinic where the prescription was Renewed. NOIS: CON-0998-10826
 
8. This patch corrects a problem when a drug is changed in an Rx, but does
not create a new order, the cost for that Rx did not update.
NOIS: TUA-0798-32558 
 
9. Enhanced the Cost Management Cost compile to use the release date and 
include partials. This change allows the management report to be
consistent with the Cost and AMIS reports. NOIS: NCH-0698-40147
 
10. Added new option to allow cost of an Rx for a specific drug to be
updated after the cost has been updated in the DRUG file (#50). NOIS:
NCH-0698-42420 and NYN-0998-11680.
 
11.  This patch corrects a problem reported in NOIS CAH-1198-32272. The 
problem happens when using the speed renew action, the incorrect number of
refills for controlled substances was being stored and displayed.
 
12.  Added a newing statement to the supported reference PSOORDER to try
to protect variables of other packages.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;21</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1999-04-16 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. Prior to the installation of this patch, if a new prescription is
entered at a site running the Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP)
package, and that prescription is for a CMOP drug and is given a future
Fill Date and marked as Window for the routing, that prescription will not
be suspended for CMOP. Even if all of the other CMOP criteria are met, it
will be suspended locally because of the Window Routing. Because of
numerous requests to change this functionality, this patch will
automatically change a Window routing to Mail for new prescriptions
entered with a Future Fill Date that get suspended, and meet all of the
CMOP criteria. Because the routing gets changed from Window to Mail, the
prescription will be suspended for CMOP, instead of suspended locally.
 
2. This patch provides the Controlled Substances package an entry point to
call that will delete the last refill of a prescription. When posting
and releasing a prescription in Controlled Substances, if that
prescription has been discontinued, it will not be released and the refill
will be deleted. This functionality will be available when patches
PSO*7*21 and PSD*3*11 are installed, though the patches are not dependent
on each other for installation.
 
3. This patch fixes an error that could occur when putting a prescription
on Hold through the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR
ORDERS] option. If the prescription has refills, and the user enters an
'^' at the PHARMACIST NAME prompt, an error could occur. A change has also
been made to the Activity Log comments when putting a prescription on
Hold. Currently, if the prescription has an entry in the RX SUSPENSE file
(#52.5), the comments always end in "removed from SUSPENSE", regardless of
whether or not the fill has been printed from suspense. This patch makes
the change to only add those comments if the suspense fill has not yet
been printed. NOIS OKL-1098-71710
 
4. This patch enhances the functionality of editing prescriptions. An
option is being added under the Rx (Prescriptions) [PSO RX] menu option
called Edit Prescriptions [PSO RXEDIT]. This option will allow editing of
prescriptions by entering prescription number(s). Editing will still be
available through the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR
ORDERS] option, but this new option provides an alternative editing
capability. In addition, if a key field of a prescription is edited (field
that generates a Reprint label request), and the field edited is a field
of the last fill that has been released, a prompt will now be given that
asks if a Reprint label should be printed. If a key field is edited of a
fill that is not the last fill, and that key field is contained in the
last fill, a Reprint label will not be generated.
 
5. This patch fixes a problem of an incorrect refill date possibly being
assigned to a refill. After suspending a new prescription to the future,
if a refill is then done and a refill date of today is entered, the
future fill date from the new prescription can possibly be assigned to
the refill date. NOIS ALX-1198-71519
 
6. This patch provides a new Order Summary of Pending Outpatient orders.
This new summary is by Clinic. To have this functionality, the
verified patch PSO*7*15 must also be installed. Patch PSO*7*15 is not
required for installation of this patch, but the new Order Summary by
Clinic will not be available until that patch is installed.
 
7. This patch fixes a problem reported for sites running Tricare. Partial
prescriptions are being sent for Tricare billing, but they should not.
This patches fixes the problem.
 
8. A problem has been reported that occurs when a Pharmacist verifies a
prescription entered by a Technician. If the Pharmacist edits the
prescription after it is accepted, but before the Label prompt, it can
possibly be flagged as a Reprint prescription, when it should not be.
Also, if it is a CMOP prescription, it may print locally instead of
going to the CMOP because of the Reprint status.

2. If an OP Rx is filled on 6/5 and the patient quickly returns the refill
form for processing, on 6/13, before the scheduled refill date 6/26.  The
bar code option [PSO BATCH BARCODED] will not accept the refill request
and will not auto-suspend to the next scheduled refill date.

3. Fixed Null Subscript error reported in NOIS WAS-0498-21833. The error
occurs when Outpatient Pharmacy receives a Discontinue message from CPRS on
an entry in the PENDING OUTPATIENT ORDERS File (#52.41) with missing
data.  Changed messaging to recognize the UR order control code.
Routine PSOORUTL
 
4. In the View Prescriptions option, the help text given to the user at the
VIEW PRESCRIPTION prompt if the user enters a "?" is misleading. The
help text says that Patient Name can be entered, but it can't. This patch

 1. Changed code at STRX+2^PSOBINGO to prevent long response time when "??" is
entered at the "Enter Rx #:" prompt. This option lists a patient's 
prescriptions after selecting the patient.  The problem is that the screen 
looped through the entire PRESCRIPTION file (#52). Routine: PSOBINGO NOIS:
WNY-0498-10082 
 
2. When the "C" is entered to copy a prescription, the computer response is 
"DC", and then the "Are you sure you want to discontinue? No//" prompt is 
displayed.  "C" should call the "COPY" action, not "Discontinue".  The reason
this happens is that the protocol PSO Cancel has three (3) synonyms attached to
it, DC, Discontinue, and Cancel.  The PSO Cancel synonym will be removed from
the protocol.  The patch PSO*7*12 will delete the protocol PSO CANCEL and then
re-install it.  NOIS: WNY-0398-11863 
 
3. When "DN" (down one line) is entered, or down arrow on the keyboard is 
pressed to navigate down a line in ListManager on the OP Medications profile
screen, a message states that "DN is not a valid selection".  NOIS:
WNY-0398-11862 
 
4. Restored functionality that allows sites to use separate monitors to display
the same display group data multiple times. In V.6.0, sites could start each
monitor by selecting the same display group by using the Start Bingo Board
Display [PSO BINGO START] option. Functionality in V.7.0 was inadvertently 
removed. When a site attempts to start multiple monitors the message that 
"Board has already been started!" is displayed.  
 
Sites that have bingo board setup to auto-start using a dedicated device will
not be allowed to start the same display group multiple times. This would
result in a &lt;Device Not Available&gt; error message.  Routine: PSOBGMGR.  NOIS:

1. This patch makes a change to the Barcode Batch Prescription Entry
[PSO BATCH BARCODE] option. Prior to this patch, if Renewals were
processed through this option, and if the first three prompts (Fill Date,
Mail/Window, and Queue/Suspend) were answered Today for Fill Date, Mail,
and Queue, any Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) prescriptions
would print locally. This patch makes the change to suspend these
prescriptions for CMOP.
 
2. This patch fixes a problem that can occur when processing two refills
for one prescription at the same time, trying to queue the first one and
suspend the second one to a later date. If this is done, the label that
prints for the first refill will indicate that it is for the suspended
refill, instead of the first refill. This patch corrects the problem.
 
3. This patch fixes an undefined error that can occur when processing
telephone refill requests for sites that use the Mumps Audiofax software.
The problem occurs because a required Outpatient Pharmacy site variable can
possibly be killed in the Action Profiles. Then if the Mumps Audiofax
telephone refill requests are processed, an error could occur.
 
4. A problem has been reported concerning the PSO EXPIRE PRESCRIPTIONS
job. This is the daily job that sets prescriptions to an expired status
the day after the expiration date. The job is initialized using the Expire
Prescriptions [PSO EXPIRE INITIALIZE] option. A situation could occur
where the last refill gets deleted if a label has printed and the fill has
not yet been released. The refill should only get deleted if no label has
printed for that prescription refill. This patch fixes the problem.
 
5. A problem has been reported by sites that involves lines overwriting
one another on a terminal. This was caused by the Outpatient Pharmacy
version 7.0 package making a call to List Manager when the call should not
have been made. This patch corrects the problem.
 
6. This patch fixes an undefined error that can occur on the Bingo Board
display, as a result of an invalid cross-reference.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. This patch makes it possible to exempt certain Ward Locations from the
Autocancel Rx's on Admission [PSO AUTOCANCEL1] option. When that job runs,
and it comes across a patient that is on a Ward Location designated as
exempt from the Autocancel Rx's on Admission [PSO AUTOCANCEL1] option, the
prescriptions for that patient will not be canceled. To designate a Ward
Location as exempt from this job, use the Site Parameter Enter/Edit [PSO
SITE PARAMETERS] option. Under the Outpatient System Parameters section of
that option, there is a field called EXEMPT WARD FROM AUTOCANCEL (#40.19),
and here you can designate any number of Ward Locations as exempt from the
Autocancel Rx's on Admission [PSO AUTOCANCEL1] option.
 
2. This patch adds a Requesting PROVIDER prompt to the discontinue
and speed discontinue dialogue. When an order is discontinued, this new
prompt will be asked after the Nature of Order prompt. The requesting
provider information will be used to update the Computerized Patient
Record System (CPRS) order. The CPRS order will now reflect the correct
provider that requested the discontinue of the order. This new prompt
will only be given when an order is discontinued through one of
the Discontinue ListMan actions, or the Discontinue Prescription(s) [PSO
C] option.
 
3. This patch fixes a problem that can occur when removing a prescription
from Hold in the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
option. This problem can only occur for sites that are using vendor
software to bill prescriptions for Tricare. When removing a prescription
from Hold, the software currently checks to see if the prescription
is eligible for Tricare billing, and can possibly resubmit the
prescription for Tricare billing. A problem can occur if it continues
to be rejected by Tricare. This causes the prescription to remain in a
Hold status, and there is no way to print a filling label for that
prescription. After this patch is installed, any prescription that is
removed from Hold will not automatically go through the Tricare process.
These prescriptions will either print locally or suspend. Then it would
be possible to manually resubmit billing for that prescription, but now
a filling label will first print for these prescriptions.
 
4.This patch fixes an undefined error that can occur when trying to
reinstate a prescription for a deceased patient.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. This patch provides new functionality for the Return Medication to
Stock [PSO RETURNED STOCK] option and the Delete a Prescription [PSO RXDL]
option. In the Return Medication to Stock [PSO RETURNED STOCK] option,
prescriptions that have been filled and released at the Consolidated Mail
Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) can now be returned to stock. In the Delete a
Prescription [PSO RXDL] option, prescriptions that have been filled and
released at the CMOP can now be marked for deletion. In addition, if a
prescription has been released, you can now return that prescription to
stock and mark it for deletion from the Delete a Prescription [PSO RXDL]
option. Previously, you would have needed to go to the Return Medication
to Stock [PSO RETURNED STOCK] option, return the medication to stock, then
go back to the Delete a Prescription [PSO RXDL] option to mark the
prescription deleted.
 
2. This patch fixes a problem of a possible incorrect FILL DATE default
when entering a new prescription in the Patient Prescription Processing
[PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option. If a past ISSUE DATE is entered, and
based on the other information entered for the prescription the
EXPIRATION DATE calculates to a past date, then the FILL DATE default
could be incorrect.
 
3. This patch makes changes to the data returned from Outpatient
Pharmacy detailed in DBIA 1878. Piece 16 of the zero node will contain the
patient name. Also, the DFN input variable is now optional, but a null
value must be passed in if the DFN is not defined.
 
4. This patch makes a change to return Fill Date information to
Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) for display purposes.
 
5. This patch fixes an error that can occur when finishing an order
entered through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and that
order was entered as a complex order with multiple sets of instructions.
 
6. This patch fixes a problem of partial prescriptions not being released
when that same prescription has a regular fill in suspense.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. This patch contains new DEA requirements for Clozapine dispensing.  The
new requirements are that there will be two tests instead of one required
for Clozapine dispensing.  The two tests are White Blood Count (WBC) and
Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC). The ANC test at some sites is called the,
%Neutrophil, %Neut, %Gran or something to this effect.  The exact name of
this test should be coordinated with Lab Service.  The %Neutrophil results
used in this order check are the result returned by the automated lab
instruments and not the manual entry. The specimen collection sample must be
identified as well, in most cases that will be blood.  The %Neutrophil test
will be one test within the CBC panel.
 
After the installation of this patch the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG
ENTER/EDIT] option in the Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) package should be
used to add this second test to the drug(s) that are identified as being
used for Clozapine/Clozaril dispensing.  For existing entries in the DRUG
file (#50) the first test WBC should already be defined from previous setup
of identifying drugs for Clozapine/Clozaril dispensing.  For new drugs added
for Clozapine/Clozaril dispensing both the WBC and ANC test must be
identified. If this second test is not added the user will get a message
when trying to dispense a Clozapine Rx, "Invalid Number of Tests (1) entered.
 
 Cannot dispense Clozapine Prescription. You must have TWO test identified
for this drug.  Rx Deleted."
 
Though this patch allows the dispensing of 14-day Clozapine/Clozaril Rxs,
the eligibility of the patient is determined by the Mental Health package.
There is no setup required by Outpatient Pharmacy.  If you have a
question about a patient's eligibility, please contact The National
Clozapine Center.
 
These two patches are required, Mental Health patch YS*5.01*47, and PDM
patch PSS*1*19.
 
2.  This patch corrects a problem where Rx's with controlled substances
are being given a maximum expiration date of one year instead on six months.
  
3.  This patch corrects a problem reported in MON-0199-51550.  The problem
is that when using the Speed Refill action if the Rx's selected are all
expired no message is given to the user that the Rx's selected are expired.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch resolves several issues.  
 
1. The routine PSOAMIS0 used the variable DFN to represent a value
other than the internal file number in the PATIENT file (#2). This variable
name was changed to PSODFN to comply with standards.  
 
2. It fixes a potential error when running the nightly tasked job, Compile
AMISData (NIGHT JOB) [PSO AMIS COMPILE].  
 
3. The site parameter EDIT PATIENT DATA is not working properly.
When set to "YES", it should prohibit editing SSN and DOB. The input
templates [PSO OUTPT] and [PSO OUTPTA] contained in the PATIENT
file (#2) have been updated.  
 
4. After archiving prescriptions, the archived prescription number may be 
reused. This had created the potential to have two series of prescriptions 
using the same number.  Added check for new prescriptions for existing
numbers. 
 
 
5. Two erroneous ^DD nodes are deleted from the PHARMACY PATIENT 
file (#55).  They are ^DD(55,0,"P") and ^DD(55,0,"PS").  
 
 
6. Updated the DD(52,0,"ID",6) with correct reference to new field location.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. This patch fixes the problem of the allergy warning label document
possibly printing prior to the filling label for a prescription,
when there is no allergy entered to that drug for the patient.
 
2. Currently, when entering a new prescription, a non-numeric entry can
be entered for the quantity. This patch makes a leading numeric required
for the quantity.
 
3. This patch makes a change to the Exempt Rx Patient Status from
Copayment [PSOCP EXEMPTION] option. When setting a status from No to
Yes, a warning will now be given, and a mail message will be sent to
all PSORPH key holders informing them of this change.
 
4. This patch fixes a problem of messages not being exchanged successfully
between Outpatient Pharmacy and an external application. This problem
would occur for sites that have the EXTERNAL INTERFACE site parameter set
to 1 (SEND ALL ORDERS AND PRINT LABEL), 2 (SEND ALL ORDERS AND DON'T PRINT
LABEL), or 3 (SEND MARKED ORDERS AND DON'T PRINT). Also fixed some
formatting problems with reports related to the external interface
functions.
 
5. This patch fixes a problem of an invalid Initiator of Activity being
stored and displayed in the ACTIVITY LOG REASON (#53.3) file for an edit
of a prescription.
 
6. This patch fixes an undefined error that could occur if an invalid
barcode is entered while in the Change Suspense Date [PSO PNDCHG] option.
 
7.  This patch corrects a problem that can occur when entering a refill
date for a refillable controlled substance prescription. The date range
displayed should be the issue date to the expiration date, normally
followed by a default of Today. The date range ending date will sometimes
show beyond six months, which is invalid for a refillable controlled
substance prescription. This patch corrects this problem.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;27 SEQ #26</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1999-09-14 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1) This patch, in conjunction with patches from Inpatient Medications and
Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), will enhance the way that
locking is done at the order level and at the patient level among these
packages. Anytime an order is acted upon in the Outpatient Pharmacy
package, locks will now take place within the Outpatient Pharmacy package
at that order level, and the order will also be locked in CPRS. A Pharmacy
Patient lock has also been created. When actions on orders take place in
Outpatient Pharmacy that could result in a change in the order, all other
Pharmacy users will be locked out of acting on any orders for that same
patient. Additionally, CPRS users will no longer be locked out of entering
orders for a patient, when orders for that patient are being finished in
the Outpatient Pharmacy package.
 
2) A change has been made in the messaging that takes place when
prescriptions are released or returned to stock. This change will not
effect the Outpatient Pharmacy user.
 
3) This patch fixes a problem when a prescription is Renewed, and the
provider renewing the prescription required a cosigner when the
prescription that is being renewed was originally entered, but no longer
requires a cosigner. The cosigning physician was being carried over to the
new prescription, and printing on the Action Profile, even though the
provider no longer required a cosigner. This patch will fix this problem.
 
4) A problem was reported that involves the prescription numbering
sequence. If a prescription is entered for a controlled substance, then
the drug is edited to a non-controlled substance after answering "No" to
the "Is this Correct" prompt, then the prescription will still be assigned
a number from the controlled substance sequence of prescription numbers.
This patch corrects this problem.
 
5) This patch corrects a problem of the Non-Formulary warning printing
next to the dispense drug on the order screen in Outpatient Pharmacy, at
times when it is not appropriate to print. This can result from an order
being entered with a dispense drug that has a valid Non-Formulary status,
then that drug is edited to a drug that should not have a Non-Formulary
status, but the Non-Formulary indicator still prints next to the dispense
drug.
 
6) This patch corrects a problem of a user in CPRS being able to enter a
refill request that comes to the Outpatient Pharmacy package, even if the
refill request is beyond the expiration date of the prescription.
 
7) This patch corrects a problem that can occur in the Complete Orders
from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option for sites with multiple CPRS ordering
institutions. At the "Select CPRS ORDERING INSTITUTION" prompt, sometimes
the default will not be accepted if the user enters return. The user is
forced to type in the institution name. This patch corrects the problem.
 
8) This patch will bring back the functionality of doing drug interaction
checks on Renewals.
 
9) This patch fixes a problem encountered when finishing orders in
Outpatient Pharmacy that were entered through CPRS before the day the
order is finished. These orders were being treated as future fills and
being suspended, since the order had been entered on a previous day
through CPRS. This patch makes a change where these will no longer
be seen as future fills, as long as the order is being filled for today.
 
10) This patch addresses an issue that occurs when removing
a prescription from a pharmacy hold status. Prior to this patch, this
action would always generate a label request, regardless of whether or not
the last fill of the prescription had been released. This patch makes a
change to not print a label when removing a prescription from hold if the
last fill of the prescription has been released.
 
11) When editing the Drug of a prescription, if the new Drug is matched
to the same Pharmacy Orderable Item, and there are synonyms in the
Pharmacy Orderable Item file (#50.7) that contain numbers in the
synonym name, it is possible that after editing the Drug, the
Pharmacy Orderable Item will change to an incorrect Pharmacy Orderable
Item. This patch corrects the problem.
 
12) Currently, a prescription that is on Provider Hold should not be
acted upon through the Outpatient Pharmacy package. If you are entering a
new prescription and get a duplicate drug or duplicate class check on
a prescription that is on provider hold, you are currently able
to discontinue the prescription that is on provider hold. This patch will
prevent that prescription on provider hold from being discontinued, so the
new prescription entry will not be allowed, since the discontinue action
is not allowed.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. This patch fixes a problem that can occur when editing a prescription
that is suspended for local filling. If the patient is flagged as DO NOT
MAIL in the MAIL field (#.03) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55), and
that suspended prescription is edited, it can possibly be removed from
local suspense and suspended for Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy
(CMOP), even though the patient is flagged as DO NOT MAIL.
 
2. On Outpatient Pharmacy labels, if a patient is flagged as YES in
the CNH CURRENT field (#148) of the PATIENT file (#2), then the text
Mfg______Exp______ will print on the labels after the quantity and
dispense unit. The patch makes a change to also look at the COMMUNITY
NURSING HOME field (#40) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55), so if a
patient is flagged as YES in either of these 2 fields, the text
Mfg_____Exp_____, will print on the labels.
 
3. This patch fixes a problem that can occur when a pending renewal order
from Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) is discontinued by Pharmacy
without renewing the original order. If this occurs, and that same
original order is renewed again in CPRS, the user in CPRS will receive a
message saying that it is a duplicate renewal request, and will not be
allowed to process the renewal, even though the original renewal was
discontinued. This patch will allow that subsequent renewal to be sent to
pharmacy for completion. A post-init routine in this build will run that
will kill an invalid cross reference in the PENDING OUTPATIENT ORDERS file
(#52.41). This will allow for the functionality to be in place for all
previous orders.
 
4. This patch fixes a problem of "NKA" sometimes printing when it
shouldn't in the Allergy section of the labels, and in the HL7 message to
external applications.
 
5. A renewal problem can occur when renewing a prescription that has been
canceled by the Autocancel Rx's on Admission [PSO AUTOCANCEL1] option. If
that canceled prescription was never filled, then the new prescription
could be suspended too far in the future. This patch corrects the problem.
 
6. This patch fixes an undefined error that can occur in the Patient
Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, when viewing
the medication profile. The error would only occur for a drug name that
is greater than 40 characters in length, which is prohibited by the
nationally exported data dictionaries.
 
7. This patch fixes a problem of a prescription label printing for a
refill when it should not print. If a refill is processed for a
prescription and the label is queued to print, and that refill is
deleted before the label prints, a label will print for the
last fill documented in the prescription. This patch changes the
functionality to not print a label for a prescription if the refill
associated with the label request is deleted before the label prints.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1) E3R #12579: If an edit is done on a pending order, which results in the
creation of a new order, the following text will be automatically entered in
the REMARKS field (#12) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52), "CPRS Order #nnnn
Edited." 
 
2) This patch corrects a problem that allows pharmacy technicians to finish
prescription medication orders from Computerize Patient Record System (CPRS).
The problem was that if a site did not have the site parameter Verification
field (#.12) set to yes, the prescription label printed without review by a
pharmacist.  If the Verification field (#.12) is set to no the pharmacy tech
will not be able to finish medication orders from CPRS.  
 
3) E3R #10287:  This E3R request was to move the actual discontinuation of a
prescription when a duplicate drug or class order check occurs.
Prescriptions will no longer be discontinued when the user says yes to
discontinue duplicate drugs or drug classes during new order entry but when
the user answers yes to the prescription is correct.  
 
4) Modified software to allow medication orders put on hold through CPRS to
be discontinued by Outpatient Pharmacy.  
 
5) E3R #11810: The name of the printer device shall be displayed at the
label prompt along with an additional action of 'CHANGE PRINTER'. The same 
functionality as provided by the Change Label Printer [PSO CHANGE PRINTER] 
option will be used.  
 
6) E3R #11658: The existence of a release date shall be used to determine 
whether the fill date for the original or refill is deleted or retained.  If
the original fill for a prescription has been released, the fill date will
not be deleted when put on hold. The fill date will be shown as the last
fill date. If the original fill has not been released the current
functionality will be retained and the fill date deleted. The same will hold
true for refills.  If the last refill has been released when a prescription
is placed on hold, that fill shall be retained as the last fill. If the last
refill has not been released, the prior fill date will be used.  
 
7) E3R #11294: The speed renewing functionality will be modified to: 
 a. Remove the DAYS SUPPLY and # of Refill prompts from the speed renew 
process.  
 b. The original Rx days supply, # of refills and quantity values will be
used as defaults for the prescriptions renewed through the SPEED RENEW
actions.  
 
8) This patch corrects a problem where provider comment from a finished 
prescription medication order could be carried over to a subsequent 
prescription medication order.  
 
9) E3R # 11309: There is a future development project that involves both 
Pharmacy and CPRS medication ordering that should address the inaccurate 
calculation of the days supply. In the meantime, in order to help determine
the appropriate value for the DAYS SUPPLY field (#8) and to somewhat help 
distinguish what was entered by the provider versus pharmacy software
defaults, pharmacy software will be modified to show the number of refills
entered by the provider. Below the number of refills prompt displayed on the
screen when finishing an order a statement such as (11 refills ordered by
provider) will be also displayed.  
 
10) A problem was reported when finishing orders by Clinic or Clinic Sort
Group in the Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option. If a
patient has a pending order for the Clinic or Clinic Sort Group chosen, and
that order is discontinued, the Patient Information screen would still
appear for that patient, even though there are no orders to finish. This
patch resolves the problem.
  
11) This patch corrects a potential problem of duplicate prescriptions. The 
problem can occur when variables are not cleaned up preventing duplicate
order checks from occurring.  
 
12)  Corrected a problem when a duplicate drug class has been entered and
the other duplicate has been put on provider hold. User is not prompted to
discontinue provider held prescription.  
 
13)  E3R #12827:  This E3R request that only numeric quantities be allowed
when finishing orders from CPRS.  
 
14)  E3R 12850:  This E3R requests that functionality be added to allow the
inactivation of outpatient divisions.  A new field, INACTIVE DATE (#2004),
will be used to inactive outpatient divisions in the OUTPATIENT SITE file
(#59).  
 
15)  A new field, DAYS TO PULL SUSPENDED CS CMOP field (#3.1), in the
OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) will be installed with patch.  This field will be
used with future CMOP functionality.  
 
16)  This patch corrects a possible null subscript error when marking
non-verified prescriptions as deleted.
 
17) This patch corrects a possible subscript error when finishing orders
from CPRS.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 1. This patch corrects the problems with the Cost Management Cost compile
 that was enhanced in PSO*7*20. The nightly cost compile job was
 calculating the averages incorrectly.
 
 2. In Drug Costs by Division [PSO COST BY DIVISION], this patch fixes the
 REQUESTS column that was showing the same figure for all divisions (which
 was the total patient count of the pharmacy), instead of breakdown by
 divisions by introducing a new piece in File# 50.9006.
 The sort and print templates PSO COST STAT, are also sent out with this
 patch as the print template is modified to accommodate this new piece.
 
 3. This patch fixes a possible undefined variable error that may occur
 during Bingo Board Display.
 
 4. This patch fixes a possible stack overflow error of a local variable
 array by using the ^TMP global.
 
 5. This patch fixes a problem where patients were not being registered
 completely into the Clozapine program.
 
 6. In the Monthly Rx Cost Compilation [PSO COSTMONTH] option, "the AL"
 cross reference node is used for accumulating cost related information.
 There are times this node has more than one record logged for the same
 date and time. This patch ensures that the cost compile routine does not
 skip any of the logged records.
 
 7. In the Print Bingo Board Wait Time [PSO BINGO REPORT WAIT TIME]
 option, it was reported that the wait time for prescriptions filled at
 10:00am or released at 10:00am were showing very high wait time. This
 patch corrects this problem by fixing the trailing zeroes to the
 canonical value that is returned from the Fileman API call NOW^%DTC.
 
 8. In the Print Bingo Board Statistics [PSO BINGO REPORT PRINT] option,
 it was reported that the divisions total page is generated when one or a
 range of divisions are selected, but does not generate the total page
 when all divisions are selected. This patch fixes this problem.

1. For a drug marked for lab monitor, if text is entered for the results
instead of a numeric value, the Action Profile reports the result as zero
rather than displaying the text. This problem is fixed in this patch.
 
2. When  UNITS field (#6) of SITE/SPECIMEN sub-file (#100) of
LABORATORY TEST file (#60) is not defined, the Display Lab Tests and
Results [PSOLAB LIST] option displays "Specimen data missing !!". This
patch fixes the problem.
 
3. Fixed a possible undefined variable error that may occur during the
renewal of certain drugs in certain sites. (START+15^PSORENW1:2,
%DSM-E-UNDEF, undefined variable PSODRUG("DEA"))
 
4. For clinics that had inactive sites, one particular management report
was giving empty pages even though there were other active sites with
data. This patch fixes this problem.
 
5. Made data dictionary changes to the following fields in PRESCRIPTION
file (#52):
    a. UNIT PRICE OF DRUG field (#17)
    b. CURRENT UNIT PRICE OF DRUG field (#1.2) of REFILL sub-file (#52.1),
    c. CURRENT UNIT PRICE OF DRUG field (#.042) of PARTIAL DATE sub-file
       (#52.2).
 
These fields currently set to the 99.999 format, need to be changed to the
999.9999 format, in order to maintain the same format as that of PRICE PER
DISPENSE UNIT field (#16) of the DRUG file (#50) which is of the format
999.9999. During an original/refill/partial fill an exact unit cost will
be maintained in the respective fields without getting truncated. This
change will also eliminate the possibility of reporting zero cost for
certain low cost dispensed items as reported in numerous NOISs.
 
This patch also makes a Data Dictionary change to the NDC field (#11), an 
unused field by Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 package in REFILL sub-file
(#52.1) from piece 13 of node 0 to piece 3 of node 1. There is an optional
background job that will move the data from its old location to its new
location. The date/time is site selectable and can be queued to run during
the installation of the patch or at another time by using the entry point
NDCQ^PSOPOST1. 
 
6. Fixed a possible undefined variable error (%DSM-I-ATLABEL,
START+2^PSOCST5:7) that may arise while using the OPTION: Provider by Drug

7. When a medication information sheet is printed using the Rx
(Prescriptions) [PSO RX] option, under the Patient Prescription
Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, Medication Profile, the
patient's name does not print on the medication sheet. (This fix is in
reference to an E3R# 12659).
 
8. A change has been made to the input transforms of the quantity fields
of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52). The change will prevent alpha characters
from being entered for quantity through the pharmacy options.

<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2000-02-29 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1) This patch fixes a problem that can occur when processing refills
in the Barcode Batch Prescription Entry [PSO BATCH BARCODE] option. The
patient record is sometimes getting locked during this process, and not
always getting unlocked. This patch makes the change to only lock at the
order level when processing refills in this option. When processing
renewals through this option, the lock will remain for the patient record,
and will also remain at the order level.
 
2) When pulling a prescription from suspense using the Pull Rx (OP)
Listman action, a problem can occur with the METHOD OF PICK-UP field
(#35). If the routing is WINDOW, and no METHOD OF PICK-UP is entered, and
the prescription has a previous METHOD OF PICK-UP entered, the previous
METHOD OF PICK-UP will print on the label, even though a METHOD OF PICK-UP
was not entered when pulling from suspense. This patch makes the change to
print whatever was entered when pulling from suspense, and if the prompt
was bypassed, the METHOD OF PICK-UP will be deleted from the prescription,
and will not appear on the label.
 
3) When pulling a prescription from suspense, the fill date or refill
date field is updated with the date that the pull action occurs. Then
when that prescription is refilled, the next possible fill date is
calculated based on that last fill date. The problem occurs when the
label that is pulled from suspense is a reprint label. This patch makes
the change to only update the fill date or refill date if the label
being pulled from suspense is not a reprint label.
 
4) A problem can occur in the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM
BACKDOOR ORDERS] option when a reprint request is made for a prescription
that cannot be reprinted, such as an expired or discontinued prescription.
If other valid labels are also requested for the patient, the valid
labels will sometimes not print. This patch resolves the problem.
 
5) This patch will modify the call that returns prescription information
to Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS). The release date of the
original fill is being added for display purposes in CPRS.
 
6) When processing refills through the Barcode Batch Prescription
Entry [PSO BATCH BARCODE] option, and when processing refills phoned
in through the MUMPS AudioFax software, the patient name and last four
digits of the SSN will display if the refills can't be processed because
"Yes" was the response for the "Allow fills for inpatient and CNH?"
prompt, and the patient is an inpatient or is CNH Current.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. This patch corrects a problem when compiling the Health Summary component
for Outpatient Pharmacy data.  With the new prescription statuses added for 
version 7 discontinued prescriptions were printing when they should not
have.  
  
2. The CPRS Workgroup members requested that the Outpatient Pharmacy package
provide the capability to backfill prescriptions for a date range into CPRS 
(only 18 months of prescriptions are backfilled upon installation of CPRS). 
This will be an optional tool for sites and none of the orders will be able
to be acted upon (renew, refill, etc.).  
  
A new option, Backfill Prescriptions to CPRS [PSO BACKFILL PRESCRIPTIONS]
will be distributed as a stand alone option and may be given to the user(s) 
responsible for backfilling prescriptions to CPRS.  
 
3. This patch updates the View Prescriptions [PSO VIEW] option to include
the provider comments and instructions from CPRS entered orders.

 were being produced. This patch fixes this problem. This patch also
 enhances the routines to use common calls, improves the output formats,
 and enhances the user interactive help messages. A new routine named
 PSOCSTX contains all the common calls.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
 
1) This patch fixes a problem of a patient possibly having two active
prescriptions for the same drug. If two Outpatient Pharmacy users have
the same patient profile on the screen in the Patient Prescription
Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, the first user can enter a
prescription then exit the option, then the second user can enter a
prescription for the same drug and not get the duplicate drug check,
thereby creating two active prescriptions for the same drug. This patch
ensures that in this case, the second user will get the duplicate drug
check, and will only be allowed to continue if the first prescription
is discontinued.
 
2) This patch fixes a problem that can occur when using the Pull Early
from Suspense [PSO PNDRX] option. If a specific prescription is pulled,
and the prescription number entered is also the same internal entry
number for another prescription that is also suspended, the entry
that matched the internal number will be pulled from suspense, instead
of the entry that matched the external number. This patch fixes the
problem.
 
3) A problem has been reported with the Queue Background Jobs [PSO
AUTOQUEUE JOBS] option. There are times when some of the options that
this option presents for scheduling or re-scheduling will not appear. This
patch fixes the problem, so now all of the options will appear for
scheduling or re-scheduling.
 
4) This patch addresses some problems that can occur when processing
two or more refills for the same prescription in the same ListMan
session while using the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM
BACKDOOR ORDERS] option.
 
 a) If two or more refills are requested for the same prescription and
    none of the fills are auto-suspended, and the labels are queued to
    print, all of the labels will indicate that it is a label for the
    last fill, and that last fill information will print on the label.
    This patch will fix this problem by printing the appropriate fill
    information on the labels.
 
 b) If two or more refills are requested for the same prescription, and
    the last fill is auto-suspended prior to exiting the session, then
    "S" for Suspend is entered at the label prompt, the fill that is
    currently suspended will be overwritten in suspense, and only that
    last fill will print from Suspense. With this patch, a warning will
    be given after "S" is entered at the label prompt for each duplicate
    request, and the user will be given the opportunity to print each of
    those fills locally.
 
 c) If the first fill of a prescription is requested, and it does not
    get auto-suspended at the time of the request, but eventually will
    be auto-suspended for Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy
    (CMOP) upon exiting the session for that patient,
    and then another fill is requested and it is auto-suspended for CMOP,
    then upon exiting the session, the first fill request will then be
    auto-suspended for CMOP, overwriting the second request, and a
    fill will be bypassed. With this patch, the second fill will
    not be allowed, since the first fill will be auto-suspended for
    CMOP upon exiting the session.
 
5) When a prescription is renewed through Pharmacy, if the prescription
that is being renewed has a suspended refill that has not yet printed
from suspense, in addition to that prescription being marked discontinued,
that refill also gets deleted. If that same prescription would have been
renewed through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), when that
renewal is finished in Pharmacy, the renewed prescription would be
marked discontinued, but the refill would not be deleted. This patch
provides the functionality to delete the refill in this case, which
makes it consistent with renewals initiated through Pharmacy.
 
6) When a prescription is discontinued, if that prescription was never
filled locally, but filled only through CMOP, it's possible that when
viewing that discontinued prescription, the Last Fill Date is incorrect.
This patch resolves the problem.

 1. Site reports that inactive orderable items are showing up as a choice for 
the pharmacist when editing of verified or pending prescriptions.  It does not
even distinguish active/inactive.  This is creating confusion because the
pharmacist does not know which to choose.  
 
2. In the Clozapine ordering software an invalid check is done to determine if
the site is registered with the National Clozapine Center.  The fields, *SITE
DEA NUMBER (#1) and *SITE (NATIONAL NAME) (#2), in the OUTPATIENT SITE file
(#59) are marked for deletion and should not be used.  
 
3. This patch corrects a problem where pharmacists without the PSOLOCKCLOZ key
are not allowed to override Clozapine medication orders from CPRS when there
are no recent lab data available.  
 
4. This patch corrects a problem when renewing prescriptions with cosigning 
providers and the cosigning provider has changed from the previous renewed 
prescription.  
 
5. This patch corrects a problem where the Nature of Order retains an incorrect
default  when discontinuing active orders while using the Copy (OP) [PSO LM BACKDOOR
COPY] action.  
 
6. This patch adds an order check for valid providers when the Copy (OP) [PSO
LM BACKDOOR COPY] action.  
 
7. This patch corrects a problem when using the Discontinue Prescription(s) 
[PSO C] option to discontinue individual prescriptions.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;40 SEQ #39</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2000-07-11 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1) In V. 6.0 of Outpatient Pharmacy when a medication was returned to stock 
for a refill (nothing has really changed for original fill), the patient 
essentially lost that refill. In v. 7.0 this was fixed for refills, so that 
when a refill is returned to stock, the refill is deleted.  The problem is 
the Controlled Substances package is not aware of the deletion.  
 
A patch is to be released by both the Outpatient Pharmacy and Controlled 
Substance (PSD*3*24) packages. The Outpatient Pharmacy portion of the patch 
will send notification to the Controlled Substances package each time an 
prescription is returned to stock.  This functionality becomes fully
functional when PSD*3*24 is installed.  
 
2) With the release of PSO*7*32, functionality was added to allow the 
inactivating of Outpatient Pharmacy divisions in the OUTPATIENT SITE file 
(#59).  The DIC("S") that was added prevented these inactive divisions from 
selection when processing Audiofax prescriptions.  This patch will allow 
inactive divisions to be selected when processing Audiofax fill requests. 
 
For this part of the patch to be completely functional the latest version 
of VEXREX must be installed.  Please see PSO*7*38 for details.
 
3) With the installation of V. 7.0 of the Outpatient Pharmacy package, the
background utility, Expire Prescriptions [PSO EXPIRE PRESCRIPTIONS], that
automatically expires prescriptions daily was not queued to run at many
sites. Because this utility was not queued, prescriptions with a status
of active were showing on the Orders tab in CPRS option and on some
printouts when they should actually show as expired. A new option Manual
Auto Expire Rxs [PSO MANUAL AUTO EXPIRE] is added to the Maintenance 
(Outpatient Pharmacy) [PSO MAINTENANCE] menu option. This new option
allows sites to back expire all prescriptions from the date Outpatient
Pharmacy package V. 7.0 was installed until the current date minus one day
(T-1).
 
4) When printng the Action Profile (132 COLUMN PRINTOUT) [PSO ACTION
PROFILE], to the screen the screen pauses and breaks do not work
correctly. This patch corrects this problem.
 
5) When printing the Action Profile (132 COLUMN PRINTOUT) [PSO ACTION
PROFILE] using the entry point DFN^PSOSD1 the header text states that the
profile is printing for the last 45 days when it is actually printing for
120 days. This patch corrects the header text to 120 days which is the
correct number of days that the profile is being printed for.

1. It was reported that patient instruction information is appearing
randomly on prescriptions that were created through the back door. This
was found to be due to some of the variables not getting killed prior to
using the option Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS].
This patch fixes this problem.
 
2. When a prescription label is requested, and if between the time it was
requested and the time the label actually prints it got discontinued or
it was put on hold, the label does not get printed.  Also when a new
prescription is filled and the user enters "^" at the label prompt thus
terminating the label print process. This patch resolves these issues by
creating new activity logs in the respective prescription entry.
 
3. With the release of PSO*7*40 an interface was added for the Controlled
Substance package (PSD*3*24).  This interface sends notification to the
Controlled Substance package when a fill, refill or partial is returned
to stock.  It was discovered that the interface was done incorrectly and
caused an undefined error.  The interface was added to the routine
PSORESK. This patch corrects the problem.
 
4. Selecting 'HOLD' at the label prompt for a mail prescription with a
CMOP drug receives a reply of "HAS BEEN SUSPENDED FOR CMOP UNTIL xxxx".
This patch ensures that the 'HOLD' process prevents the Rx going into
CMOP.

2) While selecting a certain patient related title during the progress
notes entry when placing a medication order using the Patient
Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, it was erring out
due to an 'Undefined PSOID' error. This patch carries a fix for this
problem.
 
3) The INACTIVATION DATE field (#7) of DRUG INTERACTION file (#56) is
being populated by Pharmacy Data Management module, Enter/Edit Local Drug

2) If the option Edit Prescriptions [PSO RXEDIT] is used to edit the SIG,
this function generates a new order. It was reported that the new order
created had changed the dispensed drug totally. It had picked up the drug
of the patient who was last accessed prior to this patient using the
option Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH]. This could result in
dispensing the wrong drug to the patient. This problem was found to be
due to some of the variables not being cleaned up properly. This patch

2) The INACTIVATION DATE field (#7) of DRUG INTERACTION file (#56) is
being populated by Pharmacy Data Management module, Enter/Edit Local Drug
Interaction [PSS INTERACTION LOCAL ADD] option, to inactivate a
particular set of drugs that was once set up as interactive. This patch
ensures that the call to the routine EN^PSOORDRG provided by DBIA #2190,
checks for the inactivation date before building the drug-drug
interactions.
 
3) The following NOISs, CON-0300-11493, DUB-0400-31698, and NCH-0800-41306
reported a problem when editing prescriptions in a certain sequence was
being saved with the name of the patient from a previously edited
prescription. This error did not occur every time a prescription was
edited, but after using certain options and actions together where
variables were not being cleaned up appropriately. With the release of
PSO*7*36 and PSO*7*37 to the field the name-changing problem has no longer
been reported. In an effort to try an identify any possible prescriptions
where the patient name may have been changed inappropriately a new option,
Search For Mismatched Patient Orders [PSO RX SEARCH] will be sent out in
this patch. This new option will search the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and
produce a report with any possible problem prescriptions. This new option
will not be attached to any menu, but can be assigned to anyone Pharmacy
and IRM deems appropriate.

1.  Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) has requested that Technical
Services develop a software patch that would disable the DRUG file (#50)
lookup by Internal Entry Number (IEN) during order entry
processes.  The pharmacy software has always allowed IEN lookup and quick
code lookups at the request of field users.  A quick code is a
user-defined synonym for a drug (i.e., A325-&gt;Acetaminophen 325mg Tab).  PBM
provided guidance to VA Medical Centers in the past to not use low numbers
for quick codes and to inactivate the first 50 entries in the drug file to
reduce the chances of error.  This patch would eliminate drug selection in
the ordering processes by entry of the IEN.

billing purposes. This has been done for future enhancements.
 
6. With the release of PSO*7*40 an interface was added for the Controlled 
Substances V. 3.0 package (PSD*3*24).  This interface sends notification
to the Controlled Substances V. 3.0 package when a fill, refill or partial

preventing users who do not hold the PSDMGR key from updating vault
balances and returning controlled substances to stock. For this new

When editing the drug of a prescription using the Patient Prescription
Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, the TMP("PSORXDC",$J) global
created to store the duplicate prescription(s) that was requested to be
discontinued does not get deleted if either of the following action was
taken:
1. If the edit was terminated by up-arrowing at the point of accepting
a new prescription.
2. If the dispensed drug is changed to a drug which already exists in
the medical profile (in another prescription) that is tied to the same
orderable item with active/suspended status.
These occurrences are very rare and it could lead to the following:
1. As reported in NOIS MAN-1200-11563, the patient profile could change
to that of another patient and result in dispensing drugs to the wrong
patient (action 1 above).
2. As reported in NOIS MAN-0101-10680, it could end up patients having

[PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, if the user opts to address more than
one prescription at a time simultaneously, the word "Release" is being
displayed along with the routing type (Mail/Window) for each prescription
even though it is not released. It had picked up the release status of a
prior prescription. This is due to one of the variables not being killed.
This patch fixes this problem.
 
2) This patch corrects a problem of a refill request not being seen in
Outpatient Pharmacy when requested from Computerized Patient Record
System (CPRS). This problem only occurs when invalid data is found in the
PENDING OUTPATIENT ORDERS file (#52.41).
 
3) When renewing a prescription using Patient Prescription Processing
[PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, it was observed by some sites (set for
auto suspend), that the renewed prescription is getting suspended to the
wrong date. The renewal process calculates the FILL DATE field (#22)
based on the NEXT POSSIBLE FILL field (#102) of PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
It also checks to see if a record exits in RX SUSPENSE file (#52.5)
and its PRINTED field (#2) is set. For some reason (timing delay/system
problems), this field is not being set for CMOP drugs even when the drug
was released. In such situations the renewal process tends to set the FILL
DATE field (#22) to the LAST DISPENSED DATE field (#101) of PRESCRIPTION
file (#52). This patch ensures that, for these situations, if the
calculated FILL DATE field (#22) of PRESCRIPTION file (#52) is less than
the current date then it gets set to the current date unless a lesser date
than the current date is requested by the users.

 This is an emergency patch and should be installed as soon as possible.
 
 The Upstate New York HealthCare System reported a problem concerning
 outpatient pharmacy profiles containing prescriptions for patients other
 than the patient selected. The problem happened as a result of corrupted
 data in the PRESCRIPTION PROFILE sub-file (#55.03) of the PHARMACY
 PATIENT file (#55). This field links the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) to
 the PRESCRIPTION file (#52). The link to the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and
 the "A", cross-reference on this sub-file were corrupted for some
 patients. When the software displays a profile it uses the field and
 cross-references to gather the prescriptions to be listed. If a corrupted
 node pointed to a prescription for a different patient, the wrong
 prescription would display on the profile. In some cases, a prescription
 may have been discontinued because a Date of Death or an Admission was
 entered for the patient with a corrupt cross-reference. This patch
 ensures that all bad entries in the sub-file and corresponding "A",
 cross-references are deleted. During this process, it generates a mail
 message to the installer for each Outpatient Site entry, listing those
 patients that may have had a prescription discontinued because a Date of
 Death or an Admission was entered for the patient with a corrupt cross-
 reference. These prescriptions must be manually reviewed and if
 appropriate reinstated. The patch installer should forward the mail
 message to the Pharmacy Application Coordinator, or the appropriate
 Outpatient Pharmacy Personnel, for their review and correction. It will
 send summary information to G.PL2 PATCH TRACKING group on FORUM so that
 counts of bad nodes by site can be collected. This patch will also scan
 through the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) using the "AD" cross-reference and
 will check if a corresponding entry exists in the PHARMACY PATIENT file
 (#55). The software will provide a count of missing entries in a separate
 mail message that will be sent to G.PL2 PATCH TRACKING on FORUM for their
 review.
 
 We recommend re-indexing the "B" cross-reference of the PHARMACY
 PATIENT file (#55), during non-peak hours or when the number of pharmacy
 users on the system is at a minimum any time after completion of this
 job.
  
 A subsequent patch will be released to provide additional safeguards in
 the event that the cross-reference gets corrupted in the future.

1) The Pharmacy Ordering Enhancements (POE) project provides enhancements
to Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0, Inpatient Medications
V. 5.0, Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0, and Order Entry/Results Reporting
(OE/RR) V. 3.0 medication ordering dialogues to eliminate redundant entry
of drug information during medication order entry, provide a more
consistent medication order entry process, provide expanded order
checking, display documented drug formulary statuses and corresponding
restriction/guidelines to the provider and pharmacist at the time of order
entry, and improve the process of medication order transfer between
Inpatient Medications and Outpatient Pharmacy applications.  This project
directly supports Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), which is a
key component of Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) plan to expand
support for clinical operations. Additionally, order checks will be
provided for medication orders for which a dispense drug has not been
selected during the CPRS order entry process. It is also intended as a way
to help meet the goal outlined in Objective 8, Action 1 in the
Prescription for Change, which outlines the need to coordinate
national/Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) formularies and share
drug treatment guideline information. This project will promote system-
wide sharing of drug reviews and treatment guidelines thereby enhancing
patient safety.
 
This project consists of four patches that work together to accomplish
these goals listed in order of install:
 
     PSO*7*46
     OR*3*94
     PSS*1*38
     PSJ*5*50
 
 2) This patch corrects a problem as reported in CON-0300-11347.
When reinstating a Prescription an order alert was displayed for a
duplicate drug.  The alert was occurring incorrectly for the Prescription
that was being reinstated.
 
 3) As reported in NYH-0300-12247 and BIL-1100-30086 the NSC/SC prompt is
not asked consistently between Outpatient Pharmacy and Computerized
Patient Record System (CPRS) packages.  This patch provided an enhanced
interface for both packages to use when placing orders. 
 
 4) As reported in SAG-0500-41497 when renewing prescription request from
CPRS the screen was not displaying correctly.   This patch corrects this
problem.
 
 5) As reported in AMA-0900-71796 when renewing prescriptions that had
a cosigner tied to the provider and the cosigning provider changed the
cosigner was not being updated to show the new cosigning provider.
 
 6) As reported in NYH-0900-10553 cost in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) for
the drug would not allow a cost higher than 999 with 4 decimals.  This
patch will allow cost to be entered for all fills to be 9999 with 4
decimals.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
A problem has been found where it is possible for an Outpatient Pharmacy
order to be entered through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), and
the priority of the order to be deleted in CPRS, before the order is sent
to Outpatient Pharmacy. When finishing orders in Outpatient Pharmacy using
the Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option, Priority is one of
the sort selections. It has been reported that orders were not being
finished because orders had been sent without a priority, and all
finishing in Outpatient Pharmacy was done by priority, and not by any
other means of sorting.
 
As part of the Pharmacy Ordering Enhancements (POE) project (patch
PSO*7*46 for Outpatient Pharmacy) a change will be made to assign Routine
as the priority to an order received from CPRS that does not have a
priority.
 
What this patch will do is run a Post-Install routine that will look for
Pending Outpatient Orders that do not have a Priority assigned. A list of 
Patients with these orders will be sent in a mail message to the person
installing the patch. This mail message should then be forwarded by the
patch installer to the Pharmacy Application Coordinator, or the
appropriate Outpatient Pharmacy Personnel, for their review.

 requested by the NOIS ISH-0401-40089. The Data Dictionary is not changed
 here. The fix is made in the routine PSORXPA1.
 
 2) When using the Status of Patient's Order [PSO BINGO STATUS] option,
 or using the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
 option, and selecting the OTH (Other OP Actions) hidden action, and then
 selecting the DO (Display Orders' Statuses) option, there is a
 possibility of viewing prescriptions belonging to other patients. This
 patch fixes this problem.
 
 3) When deleting a device from the DEVICE file (#3.5), using FileMan and

 encounter an orphaned multiple (#59.30001). This multiple may have been
 used by Outpatient Pharmacy at some time, but they are no longer needed.
 This patch removes this multiple.

This patch reflects changes made to copay charges by Public Law 106-117, 
The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act. Public Law 106-117 
will not go into effect until early 2002. The exact effective date is not 
known at this time. Prior to the changes that will be implemented with 
Public Law 106-117, certain veterans paid a $2 copayment for each 30-day 
or less supply of medication furnished for the outpatient treatment of a 
nonservice-connected disability or condition. With Public Law 106-117, 
the copayment amount will increase from $2 to $7. An annual copayment cap 
of $840 will be set through calendar year 2002 for veterans in enrollment 
priority groups 2-6. Provisions are included to automatically increase 
the copayment and the cap amount under certain conditions.  
 
Effective on January 1, 2002, a medication is exempt from copay charges 
if it is used to treat the following conditions:
 
   Vietnam-era herbicide (Agent Orange) exposure
   Radiation exposure
   Exposure to environmental contaminants during Persian Gulf War Service
   Military Sexual Trauma 
   Cancer of the Head and/or Neck 
  
The Outpatient Pharmacy patch PSO*7*71 and Consolidated Mail Outpatient
Pharmacy (CMOP) patch PSX*2*35 must be installed and implemented by
facilities no later than December 31, 2001. On January 1, 2002, the new
medication copay exemptions provided by patch PSO*7*71 will go into
effect. Changes to increase the amount of medication copay and to
establish the annual copay cap will go into effect when the law is
approved and signed.
 
 
A post-installation routine is included in patch PSO*7*71 to review 
prescriptions entered over the last year and to populate, whenever 
possible, the new SERVICE CONNECTED field (#116) of the PRESCRIPTION
file (#52). This routine queues a background task to look at all
prescriptions entered over the last year and to attempt to populate the
new SERVICE CONNECTED field (#116) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) based on
the prescription data. If the COPAY TRANSACTION TYPE field (#105) of the
PRESCRIPTION file (#52) is set to "2," this indicates that the Service
Connected question was asked for this prescription, and the response was
"NO." In these cases, the software will set the new SERVICE CONNECTED
field (#116) to "NO." If the COPAY TRANSACTION TYPE field (#105) of the
PRESCRIPTION file (#52) is null, and the drug is not marked as a supply or
as an investigational drug, and the Rx Patient Status of the prescription
contains "50," and either the "&lt;" character or the words "LESS THAN" (for
'SC LESS THAN 50%'), and the COPAY INCOME EXEMPTION STATUS field (#.04) of
the BILLING PATIENT file (#354) is set to "NON-EXEMPT, " then the software
will set the new SERVICE CONNECTED field to "YES."
 
When the job is complete, a mail message will be sent to the person who 
installed the patch.
 
 
Complete information for all the changes included in this patch can be 
found in the Outpatient Medication Copay Release Notes document. In 
addition to the Release Notes, there are changes to the Outpatient 
Pharmacy Technical Manual and the Outpatient Pharmacy User Manual.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 1) When the PP Pull Rx (OP) protocol (hidden action) is used in the
 backdoor pharmacy to fill a suspended prescription early, it sometimes
 errors out. This is due to a bad "B" cross-reference entry for that
 prescription in the RX SUSPENSE file (#52.5). This patch will ensure that
 the corresponding entries of such a prescription in the RX SUSPENSE file
 (#52.5) are complete when building the patient medical profile. If
 the entries are incomplete this patch will clean up the bad "B"
 cross-reference entry in the RX SUSPENSE file (#52.5) and change the
 STATUS field (#100) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) to 0 (an active
 prescription).
 
 2) When entering a new prescription through backdoor pharmacy and if the
 prescription is put on hold then the label LABEL QUEUE/CHANGE
 PRINTER/SUSPEND or '^' to bypass Q// prompt is displayed. If the new
 prescription is the only order in the session then no label is required
 therefore, this prompt should not be displayed. This patch fixes this
 problem.
 
 3) In the API's OCL^PSOORRL and OEL^PSOORRL, provided by Outpatient
 Pharmacy V. 7.0, there is a possibility of an undefined error occurring
 when the "SIG" node of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) for the prescription
 in process is missing. This patch corrects this problem.

2. Central Texas Veterans Health Care System has received multiple
complaints from patients about their full Social Security Number (SSN)
printing on their prescription reorder documents.  Currently the SSN at
the top of the refill document shows the last 6 digits, however the full SSN
shows next to the patient's name on the last page, just above the
NARRATIVE REFILLABLE RX document.  This patch will change all
instances of the patient's SSN on the reorder documents to display only the
last 6 digits.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 When editing a prescription through the pharmacy backdoor, if the
 following fields are edited: QTY field (#7), DAYS SUPPLY field (#8) or #
 OF REFILLS field (#9), of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52), the software
 recalculates the EXPIRATION DATE field (#26) of the PRESCRIPTION file
 (#52) and also kills the corresponding "AG" cross-reference entry of the
 PRESCRIPTION file (#52). In the case when the expiration date remains the
 same after the edit process, it does not reset the "AG" cross-reference
 entry and therefore the link to the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) for that
 prescription from the "AG" cross-reference is lost. The Expire
 Prescriptions [PSO EXPIRE PRESCRIPTIONS] and the Manual Auto Expire Rxs
 [PSO MANUAL AUTO EXPIRE] options both use the "AG" cross-reference to
 flag prescriptions past the expiration date as expired and they do
 not flag those prescriptions that had a missing "AG" cross-reference
 entry. Hence, the expired prescriptions show as active, especially when
 using the Orders Tab protocol from the Computerized Patient Record System
 (CPRS) package. This patch ensures that the "AG" cross-reference is reset
 only when the expiration date changes.
 
 The Expire Prescriptions [PSO EXPIRE PRESCRIPTIONS] and the Manual Auto
 Expire Rxs [PSO MANUAL AUTO EXPIRE] options are patched to have an
 additional check to ensure that the expiration date subscript in the
 "AG" cross-reference is equal to the EXPIRATION DATE field (#26) of the
 PRESCRIPTION file (#52), and to flag those prescriptions that have
 expired in Outpatient Pharmacy but show as active in the CPRS Orders Tab
 as expired.
 
 The Expire Prescriptions [PSO EXPIRE PRESCRIPTIONS] option flags
 prescriptions that have passed the expire date as expired and sends an
 HL7 message across to CPRS to flag those prescriptions as expired.
 Currently, this functionality not only sends the expire message for
 expired prescriptions but also for discontinued prescriptions, and as a
 result in CPRS the discontinued prescriptions are flagged as expired,
 which is incorrect. This patch will ensure that only expired
 prescriptions are sent across to CPRS to be flagged as expired.
 
 Note: There is an optional site selectable post-install background job
 included in this patch. This job will make sure that the "AG"
 cross-reference of the EXPIRATION DATE field (#26) of the PRESCRIPTION
 file (#52) is properly set, starting from the date Outpatient Pharmacy V.
 7.0 was installed. It will also reset the statuses of all those
 discontinued prescriptions which were flagged as expired in CPRS by the
 Expire Prescriptions [PSO EXPIRE PRESCRIPTIONS] option back to
 discontinued statuses. At the completion of this job, a MailMan message
 with the subject "PATCH PSO*7*73 - 'AG' Cross-reference Cleanup
 Information", will be sent to the installer notifying the time of
 completion. The date/time to queue this job is site selectable and can be
 queued to run during the installation of the patch or at another time by
 calling the entry point BEG^PSOPOST from programmer mode. Also the site
 could use this entry point at any time to re-start the cleanup process in
 case the job was interrupted for any reason.
 
 For sites experiencing the problem reported above, i.e., prescriptions
 past the expiration date appearing as active, it is recommended that
 they also run the Manual Auto Expire Rxs [PSO MANUAL AUTO EXPIRE] option
 any time after the completion of the Post-Install run of this patch.

This is an EMERGENCY patch and must be installed within 24 hours.
 
CMOP patch PSX*2*39 is required before the installation of this patch.
 
 
 Problem: The release of the Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy
(CMOP) patch PSX*2*35 introduced a potential problem. If the OUTPATIENT
SITE file (#59) parameter 'BARCODES ON ACTION  PROFILES' for any
outpatient pharmacy site is set to "NO" or is null, all copay eligible
prescription fills released by CMOP for that outpatient pharmacy site,
after the installation of patch PSX*2*35, would not have been billed. This
patch identifies all such prescriptions and reprocesses them so that the
appropriate copay charges are generated.
 
 
 Resolution: This patch will identify all copay eligible released CMOP
prescription fills that were not billed since the installation of patch
PSX*2*35 and reprocess them so that appropriate copay charges are
generated. A MailMan message with a Subject of 'Outpatient Pharmacy
Copay Clean-up' will be sent to the patch installer and holders of the PSO
COPAY key documenting the number of CMOP prescription fills that were
successfully billed.
 
 
This patch will look at all CMOP prescription fills released since patch
PSX*2*35 was installed at your facility. If the prescription is copay
eligible and no charge has been generated, the fill will be reprocessed.
When determining whether a copy charge was missed for a CMOP prescription
done after the release of patch PSX*2*35, we check the patient's current
copay status.  If the patient's status changed from "no copay" to "copay"
since the installation of patch PSX*2*35 at the site, it is possible that
the patient could be billed for prescription fills that were not marked as
copay at the time they were originally released.
 
 
Note: This clean up is done in a post-install background job. It MUST be
queued to run and complete before 02/01/2002 as tracking for the annual
copay cap goes into effect then. If the background job has not been queued
to run by January 30, 2002 or if the background job has not completed by
January 31, 2002 @ 2359, the MailMan message generated will indicate that
the background job was stopped before completing the clean up.
 
When queuing the background job, the date that patch PSX*2*35 was first
installed at your facility will be displayed along with information as to
whether any OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) has the parameter 'BARCODES ON
ACTION  PROFILES' set to null or "NO". If so, and the estimated number of

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 Installation should take no longer than 5 minutes. Please do not queue
 the job of installing this patch. There is a post-install background
 job that will prompt for a date/time to run the clean up. You MUST
 respond with a date and time or NOW to queue the job. You will not
 be able to see what you are answering for the prompt, but will be given
 an opportunity to see what was entered before the clean up job queues.
 This post-install job can be run again at a later time by calling the
 entry point ^PSOCPIBF from programmer mode.
 
 An example of the install process is included here under the title
 "Example Installation". This must be run and finished before 02/01/02.
 
 
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
 
  2. Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
     be removed from the mapped set at this time.
 
  3. If the estimated number of prescription fills that will be billed as
     part of this clean up is extremely high, you may want to disable
     journaling for Integrated Billing and Accounts Receivable globals ^IB
     and ^PRCA.
 
  4. From the Kernel Installation &amp; Distribution System menu, select
     the Installation menu.
 
  5. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*93)
 
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
 
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
 
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
 
  6. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*93.
 
  7. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     YES//" respond NO.
 
  8. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
 
  9. When Prompted "Queue copay clean-up Job to run Date/Time:" respond
     with the date/time to queue the cleanup background job or "NOW".
 
 10. If Routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be returned
     to completion.
 
 11. If journaling was disabled for globals ^IB and ^PRCA in step 3, it
     should be re-enabled upon completion of the post-installation job.

The Outpatient Site (File #59) parameter, 'BARCODES ON ACTION PROFILES'
for one or more outpatient sites is either not defined or set to 'No'.
All copay eligible, released CMOP prescription fills from those outpatient
sites would not have been billed since the installation of PSX*2*35.
 
NOTE:  If the estimated number of CMOP prescriptions involved is high
based
on when the patch was first installed and the number of outpatient sites
involved, you may want to disable journaling for Integrated Billing and
Accounts Receivable globals ^IB and ^PRCA while the clean up job
is running.
 
When the background job is complete, a MailMan message will be sent to the
installer indicating how many copay eligible CMOP prescription fills were
successfully billed.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 1) When finishing pending orders using the Complete Orders from OERR [PSO
 LMOE FINISH] option, if PATIENT is selected for the sort prompt "Select
 By:", and ALL is selected for the prompt "All Patients or Single
 Patient:", it was found that the software does not show the medication
 profile of every patient who has pending orders. The problem is that if
 the software encounters a renewal and if that order is skipped by the
 user without completing it, then the process will quit instead of
 continuing with the rest of the patients. Also there is a possibility of
 getting an undefined error if the zero node of the PENDING OUTPATIENT
 ORDERS file (#52.41) is missing. This patch corrects these problems.
 
 2) When finishing pending orders through the backdoor or using the
 Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option, if multiple orders
 are selected, the BY Bypass ListMan action goes back to the patient
 profile instead of going to the next order in the selection list. This
 patch fixes this problem.

1. When using the Free Text Dosage Report [PSO DOSAGE REPORT] option, 
there is a possibility of a "string too long" error occurring when the 
date range selected is for a long period. This patch corrects this 
problem.
 
2. With programmer access only, most Outpatient Pharmacy options can be 
executed by entering the option name at the XUP routine's, "Select OPTION 
NAME:" prompt. On quitting from these options the software takes you back 
to the MUMPS programmer prompt except when using the Rx (Prescriptions) 
[PSO RX] option when it puts you back to the VMS prompt. This patch 
corrects this problem.
 
3. When multiple edits are done while finishing a pending order, there is 
a possibility of an undefined variable error occurring. This patch fixes
this problem.
 
4. When using the Rx Verification by Clerk [PSO VR] option, for pre POE 
orders that do not have a SIG, there is a possibility of the patient 
instructions not getting appended to the constructed SIG. This patch
corrects this problem.

This patch addresses the following concerns: 
 
1. When entering an outpatient pharmacy prescription a schedule is required
to complete the order. If the user enters a question mark at the "Schedule:"

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. There is the potential for an undefined error to occur when renewing 
prescriptions that were entered using the Outpatient Pharmacy v.7.0
package prior to installing the Pharmacy Ordering Enhancement (POE)
patch.  After POE has been installed and renewing these prescriptions from 
the PRESCRIPTION file (#52), the SIG field (#10) could be blank which causes
an undefined error when the software attempts to display these prescriptions to
the screen.  This error does not affect prescriptions entered using Computerized
Patient Record System (CPRS).  
 
In addition to correcting the problem, this install will loop through the 
entire PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and look for the ^PSRX(DA,"SIG") node
that has only an up-arrow (^), is a renewal, and has a pointer to the prescription
that was renewed and then copy the SIG to the prescription with the missing SIG. 
This looping that is a post-install routine could take up to an hour or more. 
It is recommended that this install be queued to a printer so a terminal is
available during the install.  
 
2. With the release of the Pharmacy Ordering Enhancement (POE) patch the List
Manager action, Other OP Actions [PSO LM HIDDEN OTHER] was mistakenly
Removed from the List Manager Protocol, Outpatient Pharmacy Hidden Actions #2
[PSO HIDDEN ACTIONS #2]. This patch restores Other OP Actions [PSO LM HIDDEN
OTHER] protocol as an item to the Outpatient Pharmacy Hidden Actions #2 [PSO 
HIDDEN ACTIONS #2] protocol.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. When renewing a prescription and editing it before finishing the order,
and if the nature of order was marked as "Verbal", there is a possibility
of the renewed order not triggering an alert to the provider for his 
signature. This patch fixes this problem.
 
2. When finishing a renewal entered through Computerized Patient Record 
System (CPRS) in Outpatient Pharmacy and answering YES to the prompt "Do
you want to enter a Progress Note?  No//", the software does not present
the pharmacist with the progress notes template. This patch fixes this
problem.
 
3. Prior to the Pharmacy Ordering Enhancements patches, the Dispense 
Drug of a prescription could be edited and not create a new order. This
would happen if the new Dispense Drug was matched to the same Pharmacy
Orderable Item as the old Dispense Drug. When this occurred, the drug was
not updated in Computerized Record Patient System (CPRS). If the order is
then renewed through CPRS after the install of the Pharmacy Ordering 
Enhancements patches, and if this order can have Possible Dosages, it is 
possible that Dosages are automatically assigned to the order by CPRS 
based on the original order information. When the Pending Renewal is 
displayed in Pharmacy, the Dispense Drug is always replaced with the 
current Dispense Drug of the order. This could lead to the Possible 
Dosages not matching the Dispense Drug on the Pending Renewal.
 
To fix this problem, when the Renewal is done in CPRS, Pharmacy will 
check the Drug from the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) against the Drug in the
ORDER file (#100), and if it is different, the order will be
Non-Renewable through CPRS.
 
This functionality of this patch will not be seen until both this patch 
(PSO*7*96) and the CPRS patch (OR*3*134) are installed. It will not cause
any problems if the Outpatient Pharmacy patch is installed without the 
CPRS patch, it's just that the functionality will not be seen until both
are installed.
 
4. When Renewing prescriptions that were entered prior to the 
installation of the Pharmacy Ordering Enhancements patches, it is
possible that the Verb from one Renewal is carried over to the next
Renewal. This patch will fix this problem.
 
5. A problem has been reported when finishing renewals entered through 
CPRS, and when processing renewals through Outpatient Pharmacy. The
Instructions field sometimes displays with incorrect Instructions. This 
is a result of a data problem that occurred prior to the Pharmacy
Ordering Enhancements project, and has since been fixed. But there is no
way to clean up any of the invalid data, so these invalid Instructions
still appear on the pending renewal screen. Since the Sig now shows on
the pending renewal screen, the software no longer needs to show the
Instructions, so the Instructions will now be removed from the display.

A problem has been reported of a status mismatch between Outpatient 
Pharmacy orders and the corresponding order in Computerized Patient

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. With the release of the Pharmacy Ordering Enhancement patch (POE), 
functionality was added to compute the quantity for prescriptions for
possible dosages.  During the testing phase for POE the computation of
quantity for CMOP prescriptions was not identified as being a problem.  The
problem for the CMOP prescription happens when, for instance a prescription
has a medication instruction that states to "TAKE 1 TABLET FOR 90 DAYS".
For non-CMOP prescriptions a quantity of 90 tablets would normally be
dispensed, but for CMOP prescriptions the quantity often times should be a
quantity of 100.  When the CMOP prescriptions are renewed the quantity is
reduced from 100 to 90.  The correction to the software is that the quantity
for all renewals will not be calculated, but use the quantity already
entered for the prescription being renewed.  
 
2. The prescription editing functionality that allows prescriptions to be 
edited has been enhanced to process all fields selected for editing and
verify that the edits do not cause a new prescription (order) to be created
before updating the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and CPRS ORDERS file (#100).
Currently the software will update the prescription being edited and the
changes to the new prescription.  
 
3. An additional order check was added when entering backdoor prescriptions
and finishing prescriptions entered by the provider.  If maximum dispense
units per day is entered in the MAXIMUM DOSE PER DAY field (#4), in the DRUG
file (#50) it is used as an order check when the day supply is entered for
backdoor prescriptions.  The problem is that the order check is not done
when the quantity is entered or when finishing orders entered using CPRS.
This patch now checks for maximum dispense units per day when the quantity
is entered through Backdoor Outpatient Pharmacy and when finishing
prescriptions entered by a provider.  
 
4. When entering prescriptions using the Outpatient Pharmacy package or the
Computerize Patient Record System (CPRS) for schedule 2 through 5 drugs the
maximum number of refills of 5 was being allowed.  A problem was discovered
that schedule 2 drugs should not allow any refills.  This patch corrects
this problem.  
 
5. When finishing orders from the Computerize Patient Record System (CPRS)
that have a dosage greater than 60 characters, pharmacy cannot finish those
orders without editing the dosage down to 60 characters or less. When the
dosage was edited the software was getting into a loop, which prevented the
edited order from being accepted.  This patch corrects this problem.  
 
6. When entering a backdoor order and an up-arrow is entered in the Route
field, the order entry process should abort but does not, which causes an
undefined error.  This patch corrects this.  
 
7. It appears that when a pharmacist is finishing orders and one is for a
possible dose, which would have units in parenthesis, and the second order
is for a local possible dosage, the units pointer variable is not killed
from the previous order and is displaying on the screen, but is not added
to the order.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
As a part of the Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Extract enhancement 
project, two new fields were added to the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55).  
They are FIRST SERVICE DATE (#.07) and ACTUAL/HISTORICAL FLAG (#.08).
With the addition of these two fields, Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 and
Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 have been modified to set this information when
the first order for a patient becomes active.  
  
This project consists of three patches combined in a master build.  
Installation of this master build should be coordinated among the three 
packages affected since only one installation is necessary.  The patches, in
order of install, are: 
  
       PSS*1*52  PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT V. 1.0 
       PSJ*5*68  INPATIENT MEDICATIONS V. 5.0 
       PSO*7*95  OUTPATIENT PHARMACY V. 7.0 
  
Upon completion of the installation of these three patches, the master build
will start a routine that will build the two new fields from historical data
in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55).  When the build is complete, the user
who initiated the install and the members of the PSU PBM mail group will
receive a message with a subject of BUILD OF FIRST PHARMACY SERVICE INFO
COMPLETE.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;100 SEQ #92</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2002-04-23 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1) When orders entered prior to the Pharmacy Ordering Enhancements patches
are renewed through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), CPRS will
sometimes automatically assign Possible Dosages to these orders, based on
prior order information. A problem was reported in that process that
involved CPRS passing an invalid dosage that began with "0..5", or another
dosage that started with "0..", to Pharmacy when the Dispense Units per
Dose contained a decimal point. When these pre-POE orders are renewed, the
Sig is brought into the order from the order being renewed. If this 
invalid dosage information is not edited, it stays with the order, along
with a Sig that can be valid, since it is from the previous order. The
problem occurs when that order is renewed again, because the Sig from that
point on is built from the Dosing information, which could produce an
invalid Sig.
 
 
To fix this problem, CPRS patch OR*3*134 will identify these orders to
Pharmacy in a mail message. Pharmacy should then go and act accordingly on
these orders. Please refer to patch OR*3*134 for complete information.
 
As an added precaution, this patch, PSO*7*100, is being released. This 
patch will check the dosages associated with an order when that order is 
renewed or copied through Outpatient Pharmacy, and if a Dosage is found in
the order that contains "0..", the process will not continue, and a
message will be given to the user giving the reason. In addition, when a
renewal of an Outpatient order is entered through CPRS, a call is made to
Outpatient Pharmacy that determines whether or not the order is renewable.
When this occurs, a check will now be in place to look for dosages that
contain "0..", and if found, the renewal will not be allowed through
CPRS. And to prevent any other invalid Sigs from being created as a 
result of invalid Dosing information automatically assigned to pre-POE
orders, this patch makes the change to the renewal process to always carry
over the Sig from the prescription being renewed, instead of building the
Sig from the Dosing information that could have been assigned improperly
when that prescription was originally renewed as a Pre-POE order.
 
Since the change has been made to always populate the Sig from the 
previous prescription on Renewals, a check will now be in place for a
missing Sig when prescriptions are renewed. If a prescription is renewed,
and that prescription is missing the Sig, the prescription will not be 
renewable, and a message will be given to the user giving the reason.
 
        
 
2) When using the Speed Renew function in Outpatient Pharmacy, after 
selecting the orders to renew, a number of prompts appear, one of those 
prompts being PATIENT STATUS. The response to that prompt is entered as 
the Patient Status in the PHARMACY PATIENT (#55) file, but the 
prescriptions that are renewed still have the same Patient Status of the 
prescriptions being renewed. This patch will make the change to update 
all of the renewals with the Patient Status entered at the PATIENT STATUS 
prompt.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1) A problem was reported where a Pending Outpatient Pharmacy Order did 
   not show up in the Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option.
   The problem occurs when the order is a "change" order from Computerized
   Patient Record System (CPRS), and it is a complex order with very long 
   Dosing Instructions. The order would show up in the Patient
   Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, but would not
   always show up in the Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH]
   option. This patch fixes the problem, and also as part of a post-init,
   will find all of these Pending Outpatient orders, if there are any, and
   generate a mail message to the patch installer, and to all holders of
   the PSNMGR key. This message should be reviewed by the appropriate
   pharmacy personnel. The orders will not automatically be fixed to show
   up in the Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option, since
   some of the orders may be old orders. But Pharmacy can review these
   orders from the mail message using the Patient Prescription Processing
   [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option to determine the appropriate action.
 
2) When a renewal is entered through CPRS for an outpatient pharmacy
   order, and that renewal is signed and sent to the Outpatient Pharmacy
   package, there are validation checks done on the renewal before the
   Outpatient Pharmacy package accepts the renewal. This patch will add
   two more validation checks.
 
   When the renewal is received in Outpatient Pharmacy, the software will
   now check the patient in the message against the patient in the
   PRESCRIPTION file (#52) from the previous pharmacy order number sent in
   the message, and if the patient does not match, then renewal will not
   be accepted by the Outpatient Pharmacy package. A previous order number
   check will also be added to this process. When the renewal is received,
   if the previous CPRS number does not match the CPRS number stored in
   the previous pharmacy order, then the renewal will not be accepted by
   the Outpatient Pharmacy package.
 
3) This patch fixes two problems with the Medication Profile [PSO P]
   option. If a profile is printed for a patient who has pending
   outpatient pharmacy orders, those pending orders print at the end of
   the report, but the patient name is not at the top of these pages. This
   patch adds the patient name to the top of those pages. Also, if a
   patient only had pending outpatient orders, and no prescriptions, the
   pending outpatient orders would not display. This patch fixes the 
   problem.

A problem was reported where certain Outpatient Pharmacy orders displayed

For the currents orders that already have this problem, this patch,
PSO*7*101, will search for all Outpatient Pharmacy orders with complex
Dosing Instructions. A background job will synchronize the medication 
instructions between CPRS and Pharmacy so the displays will be correct.  
When the post install completes, a Mailman message will be sent to the 
installer of this patch.  Other than installing these two patches, IRM 
does not need to take any additional action.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. With the release of PSO*7*78 and editing of the PHARMACIST field (#20) or
the DIVISION field (#23) in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) data can become 
corrupted by storing extra characters.  This patch prevents further corruption. 
 
 
2. Currently when editing the # OF REFILLS field (#9) in the PRESCRIPTION file
(#52) there is not currently a check to prevent a number from being entered
less than the number of refills already dispensed.  If the prescription was
originally entered with a total of 3 refills and 3 refills are dispensed, there
should be zero (0) refills remaining, but if a user were to edit the # OF
REFILLS field (#9) to 2 after dispensing 3, the refills remaining would show -1
refills remaining.  This patch will prevent a total number of refills entered
to be less than the number of refills already dispensed.  
 
3. When editing # OF REFILLS field (#9) in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) an 
undefined error could occur when doing a VA FileMan lookup on the DRUG file
(#50).  This patch corrects this problem.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 1. When placing a new order through Outpatient Pharmacy that generates a 
 duplicate drug check on another active order, if that new order is viewed
 through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) utilizing the Detailed 
 Display, the nature of order will show as "Duplicate", regardless of what
 nature of order was entered during the prescription entry process. This 
 patch corrects this problem.
 
 2. When finishing an order entered through CPRS in Outpatient Pharmacy, 
 and there is no Dispense Drug associated with the order, and the Pharmacy
 Orderable Item has Drug Text associated with it, then an error would 
 occur if the ListMan hidden action "DIN  Drug Restr/Guide (OP)" is used. 
 This patch prevents the error from occurring.
 
 3. This patch fixes the problem of patient names sometimes not displaying
 on the bingo board when the patient has window prescriptions released 
 through the Outpatient Pharmacy package.
 
 4. This patch changes the default Nature of Order response from WRITTEN
 to SERVICE CORRECTION when edits are made to pending orders and
 prescriptions that create a new order. (E3R 16682)
 
 5. When using the Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option, it
 is possible that the METHOD OF PICK-UP entered for one patient's
 prescription can be carried over as the default response to the METHOD OF
 PICK-UP prompt for the next patient's prescription. This patches fixes
 this problem.
 
 6. When a Renewal is done through Outpatient Pharmacy, a Nature of Order
 is prompted. The response to the Nature of Order prompt is sent to CPRS
 as the nature of Order for the new prescription, and also for the 
 prescription that was discontinued because of the Renewal. Sending the
 Nature of Order for the discontinued order can possibly require a
 signature for the original provider in CPRS. This patch makes the change 
 to not send the Nature of Order on the discontinued prescription.

Patch PSO*7*71 is required before the installation of this patch.
 
 
This patch is a follow-up to patch PSO*7*71 for the Mill Bill Medication
Copay functionality. Items included in this patch are:
 
1. Under the Reset Copay Status/Cancel Charges [PSOCP RESET COPAY STATUS]
option changes were made to:
  a. Display an informative message for any fills selected for
cancellation that have already been cancelled.
  b. Use the current value of the SERVICE CONNECTED field (#116) of the
PRESCRIPTION file (#52) instead of attempting to derive it from
information from a call to Integrated Billing.
  c. Added patient name on the line following the prompt "Select
PRESCRIPTION RX #:".
  d. Made correction to display the released date for the original fill
if it is present in the selection list for cancels.
  e. Display (RTS) beside original fills that have been Returned to Stock
since there will not be a released date.
  f. When choosing from the selection list for cancels, validate that the
response only includes items that are on the list.
 
2. At release of a fill changes were made to:
  a. Use the current value of the SERVICE CONNECTED field (#116) of the
PRESCRIPTION file (#52) instead of attempting to derive it from
information from a call to Integrated Billing.
  b. Unless the prescription is already exempt, always call Integrated
Billing to check for income exemption. (Before this change, some
prescriptions may appear in the copay activity log as being changed from
no copay to copay and then immediately changed back from copay to no
copay).
 
3. For the RETURN MEDICATION TO STOCK option changes were made for:
  a. If the last fill of a copay prescription has previously been
cancelled, a message to that effect is displayed instead of prompting
for the CHARGE REMOVAL REASON.
  b. If the last fill of a copay prescription has previously been
cancelled, Integrated Billing is not called to cancel the charge.
This will prevent an error message from IB.
  c. When an original fill for a copay prescription is returned to stock,
the IB node contains the IB cancellation number. Now that a new call to
Integrated Billing is available to check whether an IB number is a bill
number or a cancel number, a change was made to call IB to bill if the
fill is released again when the IB number present is a cancellation
number.
  d. Messages were changed from "No Action Taken!" to "Prescription Not
Returned to Stock!" if the return to stock action is not completed.
  e. Correction was made to cancel "potential charge" (charge exceeding
annual cap) if it exists for the fill being returned to stock.
 
4. The site number was added to the subject line of the MailMan message
generated when one or more copay exemption questions has never been
answered. e.g. Subj: RX COPAY STATUS REVIEW NEEDED (7121). Also a change
was made to the MailMan message to clarify. The "Providers:" section was
added and "Staff assigned to update the Prescription Copay Status:" was
added just before the instructions for follow-up. The new text appears as:
 
 
Providers:
Please respond with your answer to the question(s) as a reply to this
message. The prescription will be updated by the appropriate staff.
 
Staff assigned to update the Prescription Copay Status:
Please use the RESET COPAY STATUS/CANCEL CHARGES option to enter the
responses to the questions above, which may result in a Rx copay status
change and/or the need to remove copay charges.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses the following concerns: 
 
1. This patch corrects an undefined error that occurs when all the dosage 
information is not asked for by the software when entering new
prescriptions.  This was a random error that only happened on occasion.
When this error occurred it caused incomplete data to be added to the
PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
 
2. With the release of PSO*7*78 a prompt was added after editing a
prescription to ask the user, "Are You Sure You Want to Update Rx
#? Yes//", if the edits did not create a new prescription.  Updates
to the prescription do not occur now until after the user finishes making
changes to the fields selected for editing and accepts the changes at the
new prompt.  A problem was introduced with this patch in that when editing
free text fields and the input data contains a semi-colon (;), an error would
occur when trying to update the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) entry.
This patch corrects this problem. 
 
3. When editing prescriptions that cause new prescriptions to be created,
prescription numbers were being skipped.  For example, if the last number
used for a prescription was 5 and the next number to be used was 6.  A
prescription is edited in that it causes a new prescription to be created, the
next number was defaulting to 7 instead 6.  This patch corrects this problem.

Central Texas Veterans Health Care System has received multiple complaints
from patients about their full Social Security Number (SSN) printing on
their prescription reorder documents.  Currently the SSN at the top of the
refill document shows the last 6 digits, however the full SSN shows next to
the patient's name on the last page, just above the NARRATIVE REFILLABLE RX
document.  This patch will change all instances of the patient's SSN on the
reorder documents to display only the last 6 digits. This patch will change
all instances of the patient's SSN on the reorder documents and to the
section that shows any possible allergies and adverse reactions to display
only the last 6 digits.  
 
Please Note: If your site is using any class 3 software that requires the
full social security number, it may be necessary to make that this patch will
not cause that software to malfunction if installed.

1. If a site has the External Interface outpatient site parameter set to
   either "2:SEND ALL ORDERS AND DON'T PRINT LABEL" or "3:SEND MARKED 
   ORDERS AND DON'T PRINT", a problem can occur when issuing a partial
   prescription. If there is already an original fill or refill suspended 
   for a prescription, and a partial prescription is issued, the suspended
   fill will be removed from suspense, and the status of the prescription
   will be set to Active when the partial prescription is sent to the 
   external interface. The prescription fill should remain in suspense,
   and the status of the prescription should remain Suspended. This patch
   will make that correction.
 
2. This patch will fix errors that can possibly occur when the external
   interface encounters bad prescription data.
 
3. It was reported by some sites that if the site has multiple dispensing
   machines, when the prescription is entered at one of these machines,
   the same prescription gets transmitted to the other machines. This
   patch is setting the HLL("LINKS") array to dynamically specify one or
   more recipients for the HL7 message to insure that the prescription
   entered at one of the devices will not be transmitted to the others.
 
 
                        ***** NOTE *****
The new software design will be using the Dynamic Addressing setup as
described in the following steps:
 
1. It is recommended for the site to have only one Client and one Server
   Protocol, and to delete the LOGICAL LINK (LL) field (#770.7) of the
   PROTOCOL file (#101) for those Client and Server Protocols. Then the
   site would need to create a LL for every "machine" that it has.
 
2. Deriving the LL for each prescription using the following methods:
 
 a) The software will use the LL entry from the CPRS ORDERING INSTITUTION
    subfile (#59.08) multiple of the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) if there
    is a Clinic associated with the prescription, and the Institution
    derived from that Clinic has an entry in this CPRS ORDERING
    INSTITUTION subfile (#59.08) multiple of the OUTPATIENT SITE file 
    (#59) with an associated LL.
 
 b) The LL on the top level will be used for the prescription in
    the following cases:
    - If there is no Clinic associated with the prescription.
    - If there is a Clinic associated with the prescription, but the
      Institution derived from that Clinic does not have an entry in the
      CPRS ORDERING INSTITUTION subfile (#59.08) multiple of the 
      OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) with an associated LL for that Outpatient
      Site entry.
 
 c) If the LL can't be derived through the previous steps then it's
    defaulted to "PSO LLP1" (sent out with Outpatient Pharmacy package).

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. When finishing a pending order entered through Computerized Patient
Record System (CPRS), and fields are edited during the finish process that
are used in the automatic Quantity calculation such as Days Supply or
Schedule, a recalculation is done on the Quantity of the prescription,
whether the edits created a new order or not. A request has been made to
not recalculate the Quantity based on these edits when finishing a pending
order from CPRS if any of the Schedules associated with the order contain
PRN, or if the drug is a Schedule 2, 3, 4, or 5, meaning the DEA,
SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file (#50) for the drug associated
with the order contains a 2, 3, 4, or 5. This patch makes this change. A
message has also been added that will be displayed during the finish
process only when the quantity is automatically updated by the software,
due to edits of any of these fields.
 
2. There are occurrences throughout the Outpatient Pharmacy package where 
Possible Dosages and Dispense Units per Dose are displayed, and if that 
numeric data begins with a decimal point, such as ".5," then that is how
it is displayed, as ".5". This patch will make change to add a leading
zero to these displays, so ".5" will now be displayed as "0.5". This
change will not apply to Local Possible Dosages. It will only apply to
Possible Dosages and Dispense Units per Dose.
 
3. When prescriptions are entered that contain Possible Dosages, the Noun 
that is applied to the Dosing Instruction comes from the DOSAGE FORM file 
(#50.606). If that Noun ends in "(S)" or "(s)", such as TABLET(S) or 
CAPSULE(S), the software will adjust the Noun based on the Dispense Units 
per Dose. For example, if the Noun is TABLET(S), then the software will 
change the Noun to TABLET if the Dispense Units per Dose is one or 
less, and the software will change the Noun to TABLETS if the Dispense 
Units per Dose is greater than one. When prescriptions and pending orders 
are edited, this conversion of the Noun does not always take place. This 
patch makes the change to convert the Noun to it's proper form when edits 
are made.
 
4. When finishing a pending order using either the Patient Prescription 
Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, or the Complete Orders from
OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option, an undefined error could occur if the
ListMan action "EA Enter/Edit Allergy/ADR Data" is selected to add or edit
allergy information. This patch fixes this problem.
 
5. There is an order check for drugs with data entered in the MAXIMUM DOSE
PER DAY field (#4) of the DRUG file (#50), that divides Quantity by Days
Supply, and if that's greater than the MAXIMUM DOSE PER DAY, an order
check is given. A problem occurred when this order check was given when
finishing an order entered through Computerized Patient Record System
(CPRS). If an '^' is entered at the 'Do You Want to Edit Days Supply and
Quantity Fields?' prompt, the user will exit the process, but the
subsequent prompts for that order are still given, even though the order
will not be finished because of the '^' that was entered. This patch will
suppress those remaining prompts after the '^' is entered.
 
6. When an active prescription is copied using the CO Copy (OP) hidden
action in Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option,
and if the CONJUNCTION field (#5) of the MEDICATION INSTRUCTIONS sub-file
(#52.0113) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) is deleted using the @ key, then
the software does not trigger the duplicate drug check and as a result
duplicate active prescriptions are created. Also it was observed that
deleting this field by using the @ key during the process of
creating/editing a prescription, the software prompts the question
"Deleting this conjunction will delete the dosing sequence that follows!",
even when no conjunctions are defined. In such a situation this patch will
display a message "Invalid Entry - nothing to delete" and will loop back
to the CONJUNCTION field (#5) of the MEDICATION INSTRUCTIONS sub-file 
(#52.0113) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) prompt.

2. When finishing a pending order for a Clozapine drug using either the 
Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, or the
Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option, the software sets the
default DAYS SUPPLY field (#8) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) to a maximum
of 7 days even if the pending order had 14 days supply. This patch ensures
that the DAYS SUPPLY field (#8) is set to a maximum of 7 or 14 days

1. A potential patient safety issue is being addressed in this patch.
Currently when a date of death is entered into the Date Of Death field
(#.351) in the Patient file (#2), all active prescriptions are automatically
discontinued.  The patient safety issue is when a date of death is entered
in error, which can cause the patient to missed their next fill because the
Outpatient Pharmacy system has no way of determining which prescriptions were
Discontinued and which ones should be reinstated.  This patch and the
DG*5.3*455 patch will correct this.
  
 
2. This patch corrects a problem where prescriptions are automatically
discontinued by a date of death entry or 3 days after a patient has been
admitted to the medical center.  The problem occurred when the
prescriptions are reinstated.  The fill dates are not being reset correctly
to the dates prior to being automatically discontinued.

This patch is in support of the HUI/VHA CIO SD&amp;D Pharmacy Data 
Interchange project. The project provides a method for the one-way 
electronic transfer of prescription orders from an external system to 
VistA.
 
This patch exports the PSO RECEIVE ORDER Protocol, the PSO RECEIVE HL7 
Application Parameter, and the PSO LLPO HL Logical Link. These can be 
used to recieve new orders and cancel orders from an outside source into 
the Outpatient Pharmacy Vista database. If sites do not wish to utilize 
this functionality, nothing needs to be done besides installing the 
patch. If sites want to utilize this functionality, more information on 
the setup and the data elements are documented at:
 
 
This patch also fixes a problem of an undefined error that can occur 
when entering a new prescription. At the PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS prompt, if 
text is entered greater than 32 characters in length, without any spaces,
an error will occur. This patch will fix the error, and the user will now 
be re-prompted for PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS when this occurs.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
1. If a returned to stock prescription is put on HOLD, then UNHELD and a
   label prints, the label is not marked as a reprint, so the
   prescription cannot be released until the label reprint option is used.
   This patch will mark the label as being a reprint and also will set the
   reprinted label indicator in the prescription file so that a returned
   to stock prescription can be released when unheld.
 
  
2. If a prescription is put on HOLD and later on is UNHELD, the user is
   always prompted for "FILL (or REFILL) DATE" and "MAIL/WINDOW". This 
   was allowing the user to overwrite the original fill/refill date on
   file, even after the prescription had already been released. This  
   was misleading, giving users the impression that the prescription
   would be filled and the labels would print. Since the prescription
   had already been released, the fill and the label print did not 
   happen. Once this patch is installed, these two fields will only be
   asked if the prescription (or refill) has NOT yet been released.
 
3. If one of the copay exemption questions applies to a patient, but has
   never been answered, under the RESET COPAY STATUS/CANCEL CHARGES
   [PSOCP RESET COPAY STATUS] option, the default for the question: "Do
   you want to enter/edit any copay exemption flags? N//" will be changed
   from N to Y.
 
4. The MailMan message which is generated when a copay exemption question
   applies but has not been answered generated errors at at least one
   site when there was no provider in the prescription. This patch adds a
   check for the provider field being null and if so, does not attempt to
   queue the MailMan message to a non-existent provider.
 
5. When using Backdoor Orders, if the user selected to edit the 'PATIENT
   STATUS' and '# OF REFILLS' (5,11) of a prescription, the possible 
   range for number of refills was showing as '(0-999999999999)'. This 
   allowed the user to enter any value between '0' and '999999999999'.
   Once this patch is installed this problem will be corrected and the
   actual maximum number of refills will be shown as the maximum value 
   for the range.
   
6. When the user tried to delete a single dosage from a set of 4 or more
   dosages (complex dosage), the system was not deleting. It would accept
   the deletion, but when the user tried to accept the changes, it would 
   block with the message "dosage missing!". This patch will fix this 
   problem and the user will be able to delete such dosages.
 
7. When an order entered through Computerized Patient Record System
   (CPRS) is finished in Pharmacy, and an edit is made that generates an
   automatic recalculation of the quantity of the prescription, a message
   is displayed to the screen indicating that the quantity has been
   updated. There are also occurrences when the quantity is updated
   automatically and that message is not displayed, such as editing after
   a Copy, or editing after entering a new prescription but prior to
   accepting, or editing after accepting an edit that creates a new order.
   With this patch, the quantity update message will display every time an
   edit is made and a new quantity is automatically calculated.
 
8. When entering a new prescription, at the PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS prompt,

Associated patches: (v)PSO*7*95  &lt;&lt;= must be installed BEFORE `PSO*7*115'
 
PSO*7*115 fixes a problem which may have caused some entries from the
PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) to be deleted. This patch also provides a
post-install clean-up routine to rebuild any missing entries.
 
 
Before this patch, an example of how this problem could happen is:
1) Place an order in CPRS for a brand new outpatient pharmacy patient (not
in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55)).
2) Then place an order from CPRS for an outpatient pharmacy patient
already in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55), but is missing the PATIENT
STATUS field (#3) in that file.
3) Then finish the orders in outpatient pharmacy for the patients in 1)
and 2) in that order, entering "^" for the Patient Status prompt for the
second patient. The entire entries for the second patient will be deleted
from the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55), because a local variable from the 
last new patient still existed.
 
This patch ensures that the local variable is killed between each patient.
 
Since the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) can contain both inpatient and
outpatient pharmacy information, the post-install routine will handle
rebuilding both types. It will send a MailMan message upon completion
indicating whether any missing entries were found and rebuilt for the
Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 orders or Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0
cross-references. The message will also show the global(s) that contain
the affected entries.

PSO*7*115 fixed a problem which may have caused some entries from the
PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) to be deleted and a post-installation routine
in that patch reset the missing entries.
 
Patch PSO*7*129 should not be installed until the post-install job of
patch PSO*7*115 has run to completion. When it is complete, a MailMan
message is sent to the installer of PSO*7*115 with a subject line of:
Subj: PHARMACY PATIENT File (#55) search for missing entries
 
 
Patch PSO*7*129 will create a MailMan message containing a list by patient
name of any cross references that were rebuilt by PSO*7*115. The subject
of the MailMan message will be one of the following:
 
Subj: PHARMACY PATIENT File (#55)  NO ENTRIES TO LIST
Subj: PHARMACY PATIENT File (#55)  LIST IN USE
Subj: PHARMACY PATIENT File (#55) listing of rebuilt entries
 
A MailMan message with the first subject would occur if there was nothing
in the temporary global created by patch PSO*7*115. That temporary global
is kept for 30 days. The second subject would occur if the post-install
job for patch PSO*7*115 is currently running. In this case, the
post-install job for patch PSO*7*129 can be queued later by running
^PSOPOST8 from programmers mode.
 
The MailMan message is sent to the installer of the patch and holders of
the PSNMGR key.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The Deputy Undersecretary for Health for Operations and Management (10N) 
convened a task force in April 2002 to review the controlled substance 
process in VHA. The task force returned several recommendations. One of 
the recommendations was to modify the Outpatient Pharmacy package to 
provide a record of all address changes.
 
Medical Center Pharmacy Managers are encouraged to contact their IRM and 
arrange the regular auditing of changes to address and temporary address 
fields in the Patient file (#2). Pharmacy Managers should monitor these
audits to discover and correct any patterns of inappropriate address
changes. An option created with this patch will facilitate the review of
the audits.
 
Audits consume disk space on the VistA system so audit results cannot be 
stored indefinitely. Pharmacy Managers should negotiate a timeframe for 
the regular review of the audits so that the audits can be purged from 
the system when no longer needed. The suggested fields for auditing are:
 
STREET ADDRESS [LINE 1]    (#.111)
STREET ADDRESS [LINE 2]    (#.112)
STREET ADDRESS [LINE 3]    (#.113)
CITY                       (#.114)
STATE                      (#.115)
ZIP CODE                   (#.116)

TEMPORARY ZIP CODE         (#.1216)
TEMPORARY ZIP+4            (#.12112)
 
 
The new option exported with this patch is named Patient Address Changes
Report [PSO ADDRESS CHANGE REPORT], and will be placed under the
Supervisor Functions [PSO SUPERVISOR] menu option. This option prints a
report that shows changes made to the various address fields listed above
from the PATIENT file (#2), over the date range specified. The report can
be run for one patient, or for all patients. A field can only be tracked
and shown on this report if the VA FileMan AUDIT function was turned on
for the field at the time the field was edited.

Description:
===========
 
 
1. Currently, if a non-controlled substance prescription is entered with
   a day supply less than 5 days and there are no refills, the expiration
   date defaults to 5 days from the issue date.  If a controlled substance
   prescription is entered with a day supply less than 5 days without
   refills, the expiration date is the Issue Date plus the Days Supply.
   The primary problem is that when these prescriptions were being
   transmitted to the CMOPs and they were behind on dispensing, the
   prescriptions were being rejected because the prescriptions had
   already expired. The default of 5 is being changed to 30 to
   accommodate the CMOPs and to allow the patients to receive their
   medications in a timely manner. Prescriptions will no longer expire
   before 30 days elapses from the Issue Date when the day supply is
   less than 30 days and there are no refills.  If a minimum of 1 refill
   is entered the one year/six month rule still applies.
 
 
2. This patch also includes a correction to initialize the line 
counter for the "SIG1" entries in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52). Before 
this fix, the count could be incorrect sometimes which could cause
problems for external interfaces.
 
3. This patch corrects a problem that caused a null subscript error.  
This would happen if records were being created in the PENDING OUTPATIENT
ORDERS file (#52.41) and an attempt was made to pull up the patient's
medications in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) at the same
moment.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1) When an order entered through Computerized Patient Record System 
(CPRS) V. 3.0 is finished in Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0, fields can be
edited during that finish process. One of those fields is the PATIENT
STATUS field (#3) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52). When this field is
edited during the finish process, not only does that field get updated for
that prescription, but the PATIENT STATUS field (#3) of the PHARMACY
PATIENT file (#55) also gets updated. Then when the next prescription is
entered for that patient, the PATIENT STATUS field (#3) of the PHARMACY
PATIENT file (#55) is used as the default Patient Status, and that
includes default and maximum values for various fields during the order
entry process, whether the order is being entered through CPRS V. 3.0 or 
Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0. A request has been made to not update the
PATIENT STATUS field (#3) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) when the
Patient Status is edited during the finish process if ADMINISTERED IN
CLINIC was entered as the Pick Up for the order in CPRS V. 3.0.
 
2) Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 patch PSO*7*111 introduced new functionality
that enables the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 package to receive New and
Discontinue Pharmacy orders from an external system. When these orders are
received, an immediate update is then sent from Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0
to CPRS V. 3.0. A problem has been reported on the Discontinue orders,
when the update is sent from Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 to CPRS V. 3.0. In
some cases, CPRS V. 3.0 will enter the current user into the DC'ed BY
field (#62) in the ORDER file (#100). Since the only defined user on the
system for this process could be the person who started the HL7 filers,
this patch makes the change to send the requesting provider as the current
user when the discontinue messages are sent to CPRS V. 3.0. This fix will
only affect orders received from an external system using the interface
introduced in patch PSO*7*111.

When performing drug lookups, two issues were identified. First, the user
was not aware of which item was being matched. For example, was the match
for the GENERIC NAME of the drug or was it the SYNONYM. The second issue
had to do with the search matching to the NATIONAL DRUG CLASS NAME first,
before checking for a GENERIC NAME. This patch makes two changes to the
drug lookup. First, the search will display the item being searched on.
Second, if one or more matches are found on an item, but the user doesn't
select one of the matches displayed, the search will continue through all
other items. A sample screen display follows:

1. When actions are not allowed to be taken on a specific order in
   Outpatient Pharmacy because that order is being acted upon by another
   user, a message is sometimes displayed that does not say who the other
   user is that has that order locked. This patch will change the message,
   wherever possible, to display the name of the user that has that order
   locked. All of the places where this message is displayed within the
   Outpatient Pharmacy package could not be fixed with this patch, because
   some of the routines were already in other patches. The changes will be
   made in those other places by those other patches.
 
2. When completing renewal orders entered through Computerized Patient
   Record System (CPRS), there is a possibility of getting an undefined
   variable PSOX("STATUS") error. This error occurs if the prescription 
   was originally entered through Outpatient Pharmacy, and the DEA,
   SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file (#50) of the drug made it
   renewable, but not refillable. Then if that order is renewed through
   CPRS, the error can occur when Pharmacy finishes that order. This patch
   fixes this problem.
 
3. Duplicate active prescriptions are being found in Outpatient Pharmacy,
   due to an order being renewed through CPRS at the same time a fill for
   that prescription is being transmitted to Consolidated Mail Outpatient
   Pharmacy (CMOP). A check is being added with this patch to not allow
   the renewal of an Outpatient order through CPRS if that order has a
   fill being loaded for transmission to the CMOP. The message that will
   show to the provider will be "Rx is loading into a CMOP transmission".

1. One site has reported an excessive number of prescriptions getting
automatically (incorrectly) changed at release from Copay to No Copay
with a reason of "Service Connected". It was determined that this is
happening because the Service Connected question does not apply for the
patient anymore, but the Computerized Patient Record System V. 1.0(CPRS)
passes the Service Connected question's answer from the renewed from or
copied from prescription to Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0.
 
Solution:
 
This patch corrects the problem but will not do any back-billing.
Information gathered from the results of this patch will be used by the
VHA Central Office to determine whether back-billing will be done for
these fills. A subsequent patch may be released to perform this
back-billing.
 
  a. At release of a fill, if the Service Connected flag has a "Yes"
answer, a call will be made to Integrated Billing to see if the Service
Connected question even applies for this patient anymore. If not, the
answer will be set to null in Outpatient Pharmacy and an update
transaction will be sent to CPRS to change their copy of the answer to
null.
 
  b. A post-install job will loop through all released prescriptions
starting from 02/04/2002 (the date that the $7 copay amount went into
effect) and will tally the number of fills that could have been billed.
The results of this patch will be maintained in a temporary location for
a limited time in order to speed the processing of any eventual
back-billing.
 
 
A MailMan message with a subject of "Subj: Patch PSO*7*137 Copay tally"
will be sent to the patch installer and holders of the PSO COPAY key
indicating the number of fills that have a potential for being
back-billed.
 
A second MailMan message will be sent to developers of the patch on FORUM
with a subject of "Subj: 'institution' - COUNTS. This message will
contain formatted tallies of fills eligible to be back-billed for 2002
and 2003.
 
The MailMan messages will not contain any patient information.
 
2. A problem was encountered when a patient who had previously reached
his annual copay cap had activity that brought his copay amount below the
annual cap. When that happens, Integrated Billing (IB) will look for any
previous fills that weren't billed because of the cap and will attempt to
bill for those. The problem occurred when the previous unbilled fill had
been returned to stock, Outpatient Pharmacy had an error in the process
that should have sent a cancel for those "potential bills" (fills that
would have been billed if the patient had not already reached his annual
copay cap), so IB attempted to initiate a charge for those. On returned to
stock refills, the refill level is removed from the prescription file, so
filing the IB-initiated charge caused undefined errors.
 
Solution:
The canceling portion of the return to stock processing was corrected to
handle "potential charges".

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
One site reported an excessive number of prescriptions getting
automatically (incorrectly) changed at release from Copay to No Copay
with a reason of "Service Connected". It was determined that this was
happening because the Service Connected question does not apply for the
patient anymore, but the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 3.0
sends the Service Connected question's answer from the renewed from or
copied from prescription. For non-service connected veterans, prescription
fills that were flagged as Service Connected were not charged a copay when
they should have been.
 
Solution:
The post-install job for patch PSO*7*137 identified potential prescription
fills that should have charged a copay. The starting date for examining
whether the released fills should have been charged a copay was
02/04/2002 (the date that the $7 copay amount went into effect). A
post-install job for this patch will use the global created by patch
PSO*7*137 to do the back-billing for the identified fills. If the global
has been removed from the system, the identification portion will be done
again by the post-install of this patch before doing the back-billing.
 
A MailMan message with a subject of "Subj: Outpatient Pharmacy Copay
Clean-up" will be sent to the patch installer and holders of the PSO COPAY
key indicating the number of fills that were successfully billed. If any
fills were billed, the MailMan message will contain information on how to
print a report by patient name of prescription fills that were billed.
 
A second MailMan message will be sent back to FORUM to some outpatient
pharmacy developers. This MailMan message's information will be compiled
with messages from other sites and forwarded to the Austin Automation
Center for their use in addressing a mail-out to the veterans affected by
the back-billing.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;119 SEQ #125</dt>

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. This patch contains a post-install job, which will correct a status
   mismatch between Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 orders which have been
   deleted and the corresponding orders in the Computerized Patient Record
   System (CPRS) V. 1.0. The initial problem could have occurred if the
   Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 package mistakenly sent an "active" message
   to CPRS V. 1.0 on an old order, making it active in CPRS V. 1.0 when it
   should be Discontinued, Expired, or Canceled. Patch PSO*7*86 updated
   the status in CPRS V. 1.0 for orders that were Canceled or
   Discontinued.
 
   For deleted Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 orders, the post-install 
   job will change CPRS V. 1.0 orders with an active status to a status of
   deleted and will also change the stop date in CPRS V. 1.0 to the date
   deleted if the CPRS V. 1.0 status is Discontinued by Provider.
 
2. This patch also corrects the problem of an extra delimiter being
   stored in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) if an up-arrow (^) was entered
   for the LOT# field (#24) when editing a prescription. A symptom of this
   problem is a null subscript error when trying to access the DIVISION
   field (#20) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
 
   The post-install job will look for any entries with a null division and
   if the positions of the date fields appear to be shifted, it will
   remove the extra delimiter from the PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
 
    
   Upon completion of the post-install job a MailMan message will be sent
   to the patch installer with a subject of "Subj: Outpatient/CPRS Status
   clean-up". The message will indicate how many mismatched statuses were
   corrected and how many prescriptions with missing divisions were
   corrected.
 
    
 3. During the building of the Patient Profile through the Patient 
    Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR] option, one of the 
    criteria for forcing the Status to SUSPENDED of prescriptions 
    that had an entry in the RX SUSPENSE file (#52.5) was at times
    found to be incorrect. If the entry in the RX SUSPENSE file
    (#52.5) was flagged as not printed, the software would force the
    prescription status to SUSPENDED. After this patch is installed,
    the software will also check if the prescription has already been
    transmitted to Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) V. 2.0
    system, and if so, the status will not be changed.
 
4. When trying to edit a prescription, and the edit is not allowed 
   because either the order or patient is locked by another user, the 
   message indicating that the order or patient is locked will not always 
   contain the person's name that has the lock. This patch corrects the 
   problem.
 
5. When the user edited a prescription in such a way that caused a new
   prescription to be created, the new prescription was not being 
   displayed in the Bingo Board. This patch corrects the problem.
   The prescription number from the previous edit could be associated to
   the next patient's list of prescriptions to be listed on the Bingo
   Board.  This patch also corrects this problem.

problem with the entry of 'y' at the prompt "Print adhesive portion of 
label only? ". The lowercase 'y' was being treated as a NO response. This 
patch corrects this problem by handling either upper or lower case YES, 
YE or Y as yes.
 
2. A problem was found with the documentation of the Integration 
Agreements in routine PSOLLU2. This patch corrects this problem.
 
3. In preparation for future enhancements to language handling within 
label print, a change was necessary to allow the bottle label information 
to print in a different language from the one on the pharmacy fill 
document. This patch makes this change.
 
4. The final contract award for the laser label stock made a slight 
modification to the location of the perforation about the fill document. 
This patch makes the modification to the printer setup routine to 
accomodate this change.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. This patch provides new functionality that allows the Veteran Affairs 
Medical Centers to print a patient's prescription bottle label in another 
language.  This functionality is accomplished by identifying which patients
have another language preference. To identify patients as having another
language preference use the Update Patient Record [PSO PAT] option and the
Patient Record Update [PSO PATIENT RECORD UPDATE] protocol action and enter
Yes in the new field OTHER LANGUAGE PREFERENCE field (#106) in the PHARMACY
PATIENT file (#55).  
 
2. This patch also addresses the following NOIS issues: 
 
a) ISB-0702-32646 
 
For drugs that have possible dosages, if the dosage is edited using Patient
Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, the software
calculates the new DISPENSE UNITS PER DOSE field (#1) of the MEDICATION
INSTRUCTIONS sub-file (#113) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52), accordingly. At
the confirmation prompt that follows immediately if you respond "NO",
meaning not to accept the new value, the software does not revert the
DISPENSE UNITS PER DOSE field (#1) back to it's original value. This patch
fixes this issue.  
 
b) CAH-0402-31866 
 
When entering a new prescription using the Patient Prescription Processing
[PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, if that prescription is discontinued before
it goes to the label queue prompt, currently, the label "LABEL QUEUE/CHANGE
PRINTER/SUSPEND or '^' to bypass Q//" is prompted. If this is the only order
in that session then there is no label to print and therefore the label queue
prompt should not be displayed. This patch fixes this problem.  
 
c) ISH-0902-40182 
 
Between the time an order was placed in Computerized Patient Record System
(CPRS) V.1.0 and the time the order is processed in the backdoor pharmacy,
if the dispense drug is made inactive, then there is a possibility of
getting an undefined error if a "?" is entered when editing the dosage
prompt . Since the drug is inactive the software does not gather the
available dosages and as a result the undefined error. In order to process
such an order (avoiding the undefined error), this patch will provide the
user the option of making a free text dosage entry.  
 
d) LIT-1102-71356 
 
When a site merges two patients together, the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55)
contains all of the prescriptions from the "merged from" patient and the
"merged to" patient under the internal entry number of the "merged to"
patient. The old patient's internal entry number is kept in the PRESCRIPTION
file (#52) for any prescriptions that were originally filed with that
number. If a new prescription is ordered for a drug that is already in the
prescription profile, the order entry process will discontinue the old
prescription correctly.  The problem is that if the discontinued order
belongs to the old patient internal entry number, the new prescription order
is filed with the old patient's internal entry number in the PHARMACY
PATIENT file (#55) and the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and doesn't appear on the
prescription profile. This patch corrects this problem.  
 
3. A more descriptive message will now be given to the user when an order is
accessed, and that order is locked by another user, when copying a 
prescription, selecting a pending order, discontinuing a prescription, and
processing a non-verified prescription.  
 
4. If pre-POE prescriptions are renewed or edited to create a new prescription,
the resulting prescription may have a missing SIG. This patch corrects the
problem.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch is a partner patch with the Consolidated Mail Outpatient
Pharmacy V. 2.0 (CMOP) patch PSX*2*41. PSO*7*126 must be installed before
the CMOP patch at remote facilities. This patch will be adding new data 
dictionaries to be used in conjunction with the CMOP patch PSX*2*41.
 
1. Problem: VISNs have been combining facilities and the running time of
transmissions is becoming very long.  The number of divisions has grown
to about fifty in the largest VISN.  This means 100 transmissions must be
processed each day.
 
Solution: Several steps have been taken to reduce the time needed for
transmissions.  A special index built with 'type' and 'division' has been
added to CMOP INDICATOR field (#3) in the RX SUSPENSE file (#52.5) that
optimizes the picking of prescriptions for each transmission.
 
2. Problem:   In support of the Hawaii DoD project, Pharmacy Data 
Management (PDM) needs to know when changes are made to entries in the 
DRUG file (#50). To meet this need a call needs to be made to PDM V. 1.0 
routine PSSHUIDG at line tag DRG whenever an edit is made to the DRUG 
file (#50).
 
Solution: The routine PSOCMOP has been modified to call the PDM routine 
PSSHUIDG
when an edit is made to the DRUG file (#50).
 
Environmental Check:
====================
An environmental check routine will run to check if the RX # (#.01) field
in the RX SUSPSENSE file (#52.5) is populated before continuing with
install.  If this field is missing, the following message will appear:
 
Checking the RX Suspense file for missing .01 fields.
 
667    (A list of entry numbers that are missing the #.01 field)
...
 
The Suspense file #52.5 has been found to have entries without a .01
field.
Please call NVS to clear this problem.
&lt;CR&gt; - to continue:
 
You will need to log a NOIS to National Vista Support (NVS) to have this
problem resolved before the installation can continue.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
This patch provides a report listing all back-billed patients from patch
PSO*7*123. For each back-billed copay fill it indicates whether the
patient had prescription insurance coverage as of the release date and/or
billed date for the fill. If the copay charge has been cancelled since
patch PSO*7*123 was installed, that information appears instead of the
insurance information.
 
If the patient had prescription insurance coverage on the billed date,
the copay charge is held for 90 days before going out in the patient
statement. If the patient had coverage on the release date, the copay
bills and insurance bills should be reviewed to determine if the
copayment charge is applicable because of possible insurance payment.
 
If the copay charge should be credited, it can be removed by using the
Reset Copay Status/Cancel Charges [PSOCP RESET COPAY STATUS] option.
 
The temporary global ^XTMP("PSOCPIB3" from the patch PSO*7*123 install is
kept for 90 days, so this report must be run within that time frame. To
run the report, enter D ^PSOCPIB5 from the programmer's prompt. It prints
in 80-column format and can be queued to print.

Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Strategic Healthcare Group in 
collaboration with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), requested
the development of the first Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) VistA pilot
project, named Electronic Prescription Order Entry for Schedule II
Controlled Substances. The objective is to develop an electronic order
entry system for Schedule II controlled substances using digital
signatures. To make this project viable, modifications to the following
packages were identified:
National Drug File (NDF) V. 4.0
Kernel V. 8.0
Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0
Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0
Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) V. 7.0
Controlled Substances (CS) V. 3.0
 
This is the PSO patch that provides the following new functionality.
 
1. This Outpatient Pharmacy patch contains the software changes to process
   digitally signed orders entered via the Computerized Patient Record
   System (CPRS) V. 1.0 for schedule II controlled substances. This patch
   lays the foundation for the future implementation of the Public Key
   Infrastructure (PKI) once the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA)
   regulations are revised and published, and will not be fully functional
   in this patch.
 
2. This patch will ensure that no refills will be allowed for any
   Outpatient Pharmacy prescription for a drug that contains an "F" in the
   DEA SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file (#50). This NON REFILLABLE
   ("F") code was introduced by the Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0
   patch PSS*1*61.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This is the Phase I patch of the Transitional Pharmacy Benefit Project
(TPB). This project provides functionality for the "Medication Prescribed 
by Non-VA Physicians" to accommodate the Veterans Health Administration 
(VHA) Directive 2003-047 that allows Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
to furnish medications from non-VA physicians. It mandates that for
eligible veterans that meet certain criteria, VHA will fill prescriptions
written by non-VA physicians and dentists. To determine eligibility, a
patient must meet the following criteria:
 
1) The patient must be a veteran.
 
2) The veteran must be enrolled for VA health care system before
   July 25, 2003.
 
3) Before July 25,2003, the veteran must have requested their first 
   primary care appointment with the VA.
 
4) The veteran must have no active prescriptions dispensed by the local 
   VHA pharmacy, excluding Supply and Investigational items, for the past 
   485 days from October 22, 2003.
 
5) The veteran must be waiting more than 30 days for their first 
   appointment with a Primary Care Physician on or after October 22, 
   2003, or the veteran is deemed eligible via an Electronic Wait
   List/Scheduling extract run at each local site.
 
 
 
This patch is being sent out as a combined build, along with patch 
SD*5.3*300.
            
 
Outpatient Pharmacy will provide the following functionality in this 
patch:
 
1. A Post-Install routine will scan through the PATIENT file (#2)
and the SD WAIT LIST file (#409.3), and will populate the new Outpatient
Pharmacy TPB ELIGIBILITY file (#52.91) with patients eligible for the
Transitional Pharmacy Benefit. Patients will either be entered into the
file as eligible, or ineligible. If they are entered into the file as
ineligible, an exclusion reason will also be entered into the file. Please
refer to the documentation for more details.
  
The average run time of the Post-Install at the test sites was 1 hour.
 
 
2. The following new options are provided in this patch:
   a. A new report option, TPB Patient Report [PSO TPB PATIENT REPORT], 
      will be provided to display the patients in the TPB ELIGIBILITY file
      (#52.91). Various sort criteria are provided.
   b. The Transitional Pharmacy Benefit Patient Enter/Edit [PSO TPB  
      PATIENT ENTER/EDIT] option will allow sites to add new patients, and
      edit existing patients. Note: This option will be set initially to
      "Out of Order", until the post-install runs to completion.
   c. The TPB Institution Letter Enter/Edit [PSO TPB INSTITUTION LETTERS]
      option allows the user to edit each TPB institution's information
      elements that are to be printed on the letters to be sent to the
      patients.
   d. The Report TPB Patients Letters Printed/NOT Printed [PSO TPB LETTERS
      PRINTED REPORT] option provides the user the ability to generate a
      report of patients' letters printed or not printed.
   e. The Print TPB Patient Letter(s) [PSO TPB PRINT LETTERS] option
      provides the ability to print TPB letters to be sent to patients.

This is the Outpatient Pharmacy patch, (Phase II), for the Transitional
Pharmacy Benefit Project (TPB).
 
1. An Environment check routine is included in the patch, and the install 
will be aborted if either of the following 2 conditions are met. If you
already have an entry named 'NON-VA' in the RX PATIENT STATUS file (#53),
the install will be aborted, because this patch exports an entry with that
same name. If you have not created an entry in the DOMAIN file (#4.2) 
named "TPB-AUSTIN.DOMAIN.EXT", the install will be aborted, because that
domain is needed for the Health Level Seven (HL7).
extracts of the TPB Patient information.
 
 
2. A Post-Install routine is included that will scan the TPB ELIGIBILITY
file (#52.91) and check each patient to see if that patient is flagged
with a DATE OF DEATH entry in the PATIENT file (#2). If that patient has a
DATE OF DEATH entry, and the patient is still active in the TPB
ELIGIBILITY file (#52.91), that patient will be marked inactive in the TPB
ELIGIBILITY file (#52.91).
 
 
3. A new 'NVA' code has been added to the SC/A&amp;A/OTHER/INPATIENT field
(#6) of the RX PATIENT STATUS file (#53), to distinguish prescriptions 
entered as part of the TPB project. The field will now be named
SC/A&amp;A/OTHER/INPATIENT/NVA. The 'NVA' code will automatically be assigned 
to the 'NON-VA' Rx Patient Status entry that is being exported with this 
patch.
 
 
4. A new field named TPB RX, field (#201), has been added to the 
PRESCRIPTION file (#52). The software will automatically set this field 
to 'Yes' for any prescription that meets all of the TPB requirements.
 
 
5. The following fields were added to the NEW PERSON file (#200) by Kernel
patch XU*8.0*311:
 
53.91     NON-VA PRESCRIBER
53.92     TAX ID
53.93     EXCLUSIONARY CHECK PERFORMED
53.94     DATE EXCLUSIONARY LIST CHECKED
53.95     ON EXCLUSIONARY LIST
53.96     EXCLUSIONARY CHECKED BY
 
The following Outpatient Pharmacy options have been modified to allow the 
editing of these new fields in the NEW PERSON file (#200):
 
Add New Providers [PSO PROVIDER ADD]
Edit Provider [PROVIDER EDIT]
View Provider [PSO PROVIDER INQUIRE] 
   
 
6. The following fields have been added to the PHARMACY SYSTEM file 
(#59.7). These fields will be used by the HL7 extracts of TPB Patient 
information:
 
46.1    TRANSMISSION START DATE
46.2    TRANSMISSION END DATE
46.3    BATCH CONTROL ID
46.4    NUMBER OF MSH COUNT
46.5    NUMBER OF LINES COUNT
 
The HL7 extract will automatically be done on all patients upon initial 
patch install, then the job will be automatically queued to run every 
evening at 6:00pm, and the extract will check the day of the week, and 
only send data on Sundays. In addition to the fields listed above, the 
patch also exports the following to enable the HL7 extracts:
 
OPTION:
   PSO AUTOQUEUE JOBS 
   PSO TPB HL7 EXTRACT
 
PROTOCOL:
   PSO TPB EV 
   PSO TPB SUB
 
HL7 APPLICATION PARAMETER:
   PSO TPB-AAC   
   PSO TPB-PHARM
 
HL LOGICAL LINK:
   PSOTPBAAC   
 
 
The TPB HL7 Data Extract/Transmission [PSO TPB HL7 EXTRACT] option has 
been added to the jobs that can be requeued from the Queue Background 
Jobs [PSO AUTOQUEUE JOBS] option.
                                  
 
7. A new stand-alone option, PSO TPB RX ENTRY [TPB Rx (Prescription)
Entry], is being exported with this patch. This option will provide the
capability to enter TPB prescriptions for TPB eligible patients. Included
in this option will be the ability to enter/edit Provider Information, 
and the ability to enter/edit Allergy information. Only patients eligible
for the TPB benefit will be selectable through this option. When entering
the prescription information, the RX Patient Status must be 'NON-VA', and
the Provider that is selected for the prescription must meet the following
2 criteria: the NON-VA PRESCRIBER field (#53.91) in the NEW PERSON file
(#200) must be set to 'Yes', and the ON EXCLUSIONARY LIST field (#53.95)
in the NEW PERSON file (#200) must be set to 'No'. Any prescription
entered, verified, or completed through this option will be flagged as a
TPB RX.
 
 
8. When patients or prescriptions  are selected or presented in the 
following options, and the patient is eligible for the TPB benefit, a 
warning will be given that this patient is eligible for the Transitional 
Pharmacy Benefit. This warning is given because any new order created 
through these options for a patient eligible for the TPB benefit will not 
be flagged as a TPB prescription, since the new option, PSO TPB RX ENTRY
[TPB Rx (Prescription) Entry] was not used:
 
Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH]
Edit Prescriptions [PSO RXEDIT]
Barcode Batch Prescription Entry [PSO BATCH BARCODE]
 
 
9. Anytime a prescription is discontinued, a check will be done on that 
prescription and patient. If the prescription is a TPB prescription, and 
the patient is still eligible for the Transitional Pharmacy Benefit, and
that patient has no more active TPB prescriptions, then the INACTIVATION
OF BENEFIT DATE field (#2) of the TPB ELIGIBILITY file (#52.91) will
automatically be set to the current date, making that patient ineligible
for the benefit. Also, the INACTIVATION REASON CODE field (#3) of the TPB
ELIGIBILITY file (#52.91) will automatically be set to 'ALL RX'S 
INACTIVE'.
 
 
10. Anytime a patient is inactivated in the TPB ELIGIBILITY file 
(#52.91), a check will be done on the default Rx Patient Status for that 
patient on the PATIENT STATUS field (#3) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file 
(#55), and if that Rx Patient Status is 'NON-VA', it will be set to null.
 
 
11. When entering new prescriptions through either the Patient 
Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] or the Complete Orders 
from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH], the Rx Patient Status of 'NON-VA' will not 
be selectable, since these orders cannot be flagged as TPB prescriptions.

 Problem: 
 ========
 
   The Patient Merge process was not updating entries in the PRESCRIPTION 
   file (#52) with the new patient's internal entry number (IEN).
 
 Solution:
 =========
 
   The Patient Merge patch XT*7.3*73 fixed this problem to appropriately
   update the PATIENT field (#2) in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) for
   future patient merges. Patch PSO*7*136 has a environment check routine
   PSOPI136 to update this field with the correct patient's internal
   entry number ("merged to").  At the completion of this job, a MailMan
   message with the subject "PSO*7*136 PRESCRIPTION file (#52) - Patient
   Merge clean up", will be sent to the installer notifying the start
   time and time of completion.  The message will provide a list of
   prescriptions with the corrected patient's internal entry number.
   It will also list prescriptions that had the CPRS status adjusted to
   match the Pharmacy status.

        -DSM-I-ECODE, MUMPS error code: M6
 
   The routine was corrected to reinitialize the variable if it does not

2. CLA-0303-20198
   The Manual Auto Expire Rxs [PSO MANUAL AUTO EXPIRE] option was
   initially provided to synchronize the expired order status between
   Outpatient Pharmacy prescriptions and Computerized Patient Record
   System (CPRS) V. 1.0 order entries. And as such, the start date was set
   to the date Outpatient Pharmacy Version 7.0 was installed minus 120
   days. A few sites have reported that some of the very old
   prescriptions, specifically those that are 120 days prior to the date
   Outpatient Pharmacy Version 7.0 was installed, show an active status
   when viewed via FileMan. In order to scan the PRESCRIPTION file (#52)
   and flag such orders as expired, this option has been modified to
   provide the user the flexibility to select a start date and the default
   is set to the date Outpatient Pharmacy Version 7.0 was installed minus
   120 days.
 
3. CLE-0303-42391
   This NOIS call reported that the PROVIDER COMMENTS field (#39) of the
   PRESCRIPTION file (#52) was being lost when a prescription was renewed
   from Outpatient Pharmacy. A correction was made to send the comments to
   CPRS when the prescription is renewed from Outpatient Pharmacy.
 
4. ISB-0403-31630
   This NOIS call reported a problem in the display of Allergy severity
   in the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
   option, on the Detailed Allergy Display screen. The content of the
   field "Severity:" was limited to one, and only one, value. The possible
   values were: MILD, MODERATE or SEVERE. The first Severity on file was
   displayed. Since it is possible to have more than one Severity per
   Allergy, this display was changed to show all the Severities on file,
   along with the dates on which each one was observed. See example below:
 
        Before:     Severity: MODERATE
 
        Now:        Severity: 04/07/03 MODERATE
                              04/15/03 MILD
                              04/17/03 SEVERE
 
   Besides the changes to this display, the HL7 message for External
   Interfaces was also changed. The ZAL segment will have one for each
   severity observed. Before, it would have only one entry for the
   oldest severity observed. Furthermore, the date the severity was
   observed is being added as field #8 of this segment. From the same
   example from above, here is how the ZAL segment will look:
 
     Before:
      ZAL|530|NIACIN 100MG TAB |ALLERGY|DRUG|VERIFIED|MODERATE
 
     Now:
      ZAL|530|NIACIN 100MG TAB |ALLERGY|DRUG|VERIFIED|MODERATE|20030407|
      ZAL|530|NIACIN 100MG TAB |ALLERGY|DRUG|VERIFIED|MILD|20030415|
      ZAL|530|NIACIN 100MG TAB |ALLERGY|DRUG|VERIFIED|SEVERE|20030417|
 
5. ANN-0902-40951
   An undefined error was reported when using the Patient Prescription
   Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option. If the drug of an active
   order is edited, but the user quits without saving the changes and a
   new order for the same drug is placed immediately afterwards, the error
   could occur. This patch fixes this issue.
 
6. LAS-0503-60830 &amp; BRX-0603-11755
   The "NTE|2|" segment in the HL7 message generated for external
   interfaces is composed by the concatenation of the following Freetext
   fields from the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) in this order:
 
       Field #   Name
       ------------------------------------------
       1005      NARRATIVE FOR REFILLABLE RX
       1006      NARRATIVE FOR NON-REFILLABLE RX
       1004      NARRATIVE FOR COPAY DOCUMENT
 
   When building this segment, the routine PSOHLSG2 was skipping one line
   between the content of each field. This line is being interpreted by
   some external interfaces, such as Optifill, as the end of the "NTE|2|"
   segment, because all it contains is a carriage return character. This
   caused the external interface to reject messages with only a carriage
   return in the line. To solve this problem a blank space will be
   inserted between the content of each field. In the example below, the
   blank space will be added where the arrow ("-&gt;") is pointing.
 
        :
       NTE|2|
       Call in your refill on your touch-tone phone.
       Outside the metropolitan area: 1-800-123-4567.

       The copay required is $7.00 for every 30 day or less supply of
       medication or $21.00 for a 90-day supply. Be sure to indicate your
       complete SSN on your check.

7. WIM-0603-20338
   The Print from Suspense File [PSO PNDLBL] option allows an user
   to queue the printing of the labels at a later time by Taskman. A
   problem was found when the original task was re-queued through the
   Taskman Requeue Tasks [XUTM REQ] option by a different user. Once
   the labels printed, the label print activity log for the prescription
   was recorded as being performed by the second user, the one who
   re-queued the Taskman task, which is wrong. This patch makes the
   correction to keep the user who queued the label print through the
   Print from Suspense File [PSO PNDLBL] option in the label print
   activity log.
 
8. MAC-0603-60315
   Patch PSO*7*124 introduced the following change:
 
         Currently, if a non-controlled substance prescription is entered
         with a day supply less than 5 days and there are no refills, the
         expiration date defaults to 5 days from the issue date. If a
         controlled substance prescription is entered with a day supply
         less than 5 days without refills, the expiration date is the
         Issue Date plus the Days Supply. The primary problem is that
         when these prescriptions were being transmitted to the CMOPs and
         they were behind on dispensing, the prescriptions were being
         rejected because the prescriptions had already expired. The
         default of 5 is being changed to 30 to accommodate the CMOPs and
         to allow the patients to receive their medications in a timely
         manner. Prescriptions will no longer expire before 30 days
         elapses from the Issue Date when the day supply is less than 30
         days and there are no refills.  If a minimum of 1 refill is
         entered the one year/six month rule still applies.
 
   This created a problem for some sites with a rehab unit where some
   patients go out on Authorized Absence every weekend. The site then
   enters a prescription with a patient status of AUTHORIZED ABSENCE and
   no refills and a small number for days supply (3 or 4 days). Before,
   such prescriptions expired within 5 days from the issue date and no
   longer showed on the Medication Profile screen. Now, after PSO*7*124
   was installed, such prescriptions remain active for at least 30 days.
   The result is that multiple prescriptions for a single drug are listed
   in the Medication Profile screen. Active prescriptions with a patient
   status of AUTHORIZED ABSENCE can contain the same drug already in
   another active prescription for the same patient.
   Once this patch is installed, prescriptions with a patient status of
   AUTHORIZED ABSENCE and no refills will have the expiration date
   calculation reversed to a minimum of 5 days from the issue date,
   instead of the 30 days introduced by patch PSO*7*124.
 
9. PUG-0603-50491
   This NOIS call reported a problem with the patient security check for
   the Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option. An example of
   a patient security check is when an employee tries to get access to
   his own medical record and is denied. In the case of the menu option
   mentioned above, such security checks were not being performed when
   the user selected to process ALL the patients with pending orders.
   Also, when processing by clinic, route or priority, there were no
   security checks performed. The only time the security checks were
   performed was when the user selected to process a single patient.
   When this patch is installed, this problem will be resolved and the
   Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option will perform the
   security checks consistently for all the possible selections when
   finishing pending orders.
 
10. CON-0703-11685, MAR-0703-21567 &amp; SBY-0703-31538
    When trying to reinstate discontinued prescriptions for a patient that
    had the DATE OF DEATH field (#.351) in the PATIENT file (#2) entered
    and then deleted, the user was getting an "Undefined variable DA"
    error. This problem was introduced by patch PSO*7*117, more
    specifically by the changes described in item #2b which was made to
    address NOIS call CAH-0402-31866. This patch corrects the problem
    with the use of that variable.
 
11. MIN-1202-40079, FRE-0303-60233 &amp; RIC-0603-21344
    In some situations where a patient is being accessed by Inpatient
    Pharmacy Version 5.0, if an attempt is made to finish orders in
    Outpatient Pharmacy Version 7.0, a message is received that the
    patient is in use. Then if an "^" is entered for the PATIENT STATUS
    prompt, the cross-reference entries in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55)
    could be deleted for that patient. This patch corrects the problem.  A
    follow-up patch will provide a clean up to rebuild missing
    cross-references.
 
12. HUN-0603-21419 &amp; WPB-0803-30273
    There has been some instances where a prescription from one patient
    was being displayed on the Bingo Board for a different patient. This

is installed, run the routine PSOLLU3 in programmer mode. Once you have
updated all current laser label devices, the routine may be deleted.

This patch contains routines, new options, new Data Dictionary fields, and
documentation for implementing the ScripTalk(R) 'talking' prescription
labels functionality, which will greatly benefit visually impaired
veterans.
 
Thanks to Rob Silverman at Hines for his extensive research and
development work for a class III solution, upon which this patch is based.
 
ScripTalk(R) Talking Prescriptions will provide the ability for VA points
of care to purchase and distribute adaptive equipment to patients who are
unable to read the traditional label on prescription bottles. This patch 
provides a way to print to a microchip-embedded label that can be applied 
to a medication bottle. When the label is held next to a ScripTalk(R) 
reader, the reader will read the contents of the label aloud to the 
patient. This improves patient safety for patients with substantial loss 
of vision as it allows them to safely determine the contents and 
administration schedules of their medications.
 
ScripTalk(R) is a registered trademark of En-Vision America.
 
In addition to the ScripTalk changes, this patch corrects some laser
labels formatting problems in the warning label and method of pick-up
sections. 
 
NOTE: As part of the laser labels corrections, the utility routine that 
was used in patch PSO*7*141 has been modified. A correction for the return
mail initialization control code in the TERMINAL TYPE file (#3.2) has been
added. Once the patch is installed, run the routine PSOLLU3 in programmer
mode. Once you have updated all current laser label devices, the routine
may be deleted.

1. A new code has been added to the INACTIVATION REASON CODE field (#3)
of the TPB ELIGIBILITY file (#52.91). The code is PATIENT UNREACHABLE.
This code will now be selectable when manually inactivating a patient
from the TPB ELIGIBILITY file (#52.91). It will also display, when
appropriate, on the reports generated by the Report TPB Patients Letters
Printed/NOT Printed [PSO TPB LETTERS PRINTED REPORT] option, and the TPB
Patient Report [PSO TPB PATIENT REPORT] option.
 
2. Every Sunday, Transitional Pharmacy Benefit (TPB) patient data is sent
in an HL7 message to Austin. This patch exports a new mail group, PSO TPB
HL7 EXTRACT. Members of this mail group will receive weekly mail messages
concerning the HL7 extract of TPB patient information. These messages
will either display information that the message generation was
successful, or display information that the message generation was
unsuccessful, along with a reason why it was unsuccessful. Upon install,
the installer will be prompted for the coordinator of the mail group. The
Post-Install routine of this patch will automatically add the patch
installer as a member of the mail group.
 
The Post-Install routine PSO153PS will also set the AUTOSTART field (#4.5)
of the HL LOGICAL LINK file (#870) of the PSOTPBAAC HL Logical Link to
"Enabled".
 
A correction has been made to the HL7 message to distinguish between
a new record and an edited record.
 
3. The weekly HL7 transmission to Austin is found to cause problems at few
sites due to some bad "AX" cross-references of the TPB ELIGIBILITY file
(#52.91). This patch fixes this issue.
 
4. There is a possibility of getting a null subscript error when using the
View Provider [PSO PROVIDER INQUIRE] option to view the provider details
after either of the following circumstances:
 
a. When a new provider was added using the Add New Providers [PSO PROVIDER
   ADD] option, and "No" was the response to the NON-VA PRESCRIBER field
   (#53.91) of NEW PERSON file (#200).
b. When a Provider was edited using the Edit Provider [PSO PROVIDER EDIT]
   option, and "No" was the response to the NON-VA PRESCRIBER field
   (#53.91) of NEW PERSON file (#200), and then an "^" was entered prior
   to responding to the prompts for these fields of the NEW PERSON file
   (#200):
   TAX ID field (#53.92)
   EXCLUSIONARY CHECK PERFORMED field (#53.93)
   DATE EXCLUSIONARY LIST CHECKED field (#53.94)
   ON EXCLUSIONARY LIST field  (#53.95)
   EXCLUSIONARY CHECKED BY field (#53.96)
 
This patch corrects the error.
 
5. When selecting a provider using the TPB Rx (Prescription) Entry [PSO
TPB RXENTRY] option, if the provider is unauthorized to write med orders
or flagged as inactive, there are currently no alerts or warnings
indicating that the provider cannot be selected. This patch will provide
one of the following messages during provider selection if such conditions
are encountered:
 
a. This Provider is not Authorized to Write Med Orders. Use the Edit
   Provider [PSO PROVIDER EDIT] option to change the Authorization flag.
 
b. This Provider is flagged as Inactive. Use the Edit Provider
   [PSO PROVIDER EDIT] option to change the Inactive Date.
 
c. This Provider is not Authorized to Write Med Orders and flagged as
   Inactive. Use the Edit Provider [PSO PROVIDER EDIT] option to change
   them.
 
6. The FAX NUMBER field (#.136) of the NEW PERSON file (#200) has been
added to the following options, for display and for editing:
Add New Providers [PSO PROVIDER ADD] option
Edit Provider [PSO PROVIDER EDIT] option
View Provider [PSO PROVIDER INQUIRE] option
 
This enhancement is requested by E3R 18457.
 
7. This patch provides an API to the Scheduling V. 5.3 package that
returns a list of all patients eligible for the TPB, to be used for
reporting purposes.

1.  Currently, the HealtheVet system invokes the Outpatient Pharmacy
V. 7.0 application to order a prescription refill and to check the status
of the prescription refill process. The required input parameters include
Integration Control Number (ICN), Social Security Number (SSN), and
Prescription number (Rx #). This has caused a duplication in functionality
and slow response time. To help speed up the process, a minor enhancement
has been requested that will eliminate the use of ICN and remove the cross
checking of SSN because the HealtheVet system itself verifies the accuracy
of the SSN and supplies the patient number. This patch would provide this
enhancement.
 
Furthermore, besides the information that Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 
currently returns to the HealtheVet system, it is also requested that two
new fields be made available to them: Outpatient Pharmacy Division and
Prescription Refill Status. This patch provides this information in the
requested format.
 
2. The HealtheVet team has requested an additional Outpatient Pharmacy
V. 7.0 Application Program Interface (API) to provide Outpatient Pharmacy
division information. The information requested is Inactive Status,
Division Name, Area Code, Phone Number, and Refill Narrative Text. This
patch makes the required information available.
 
Note: Sites installing this patch will not notice any changes unless they
are using the HealtheVet Internet Prescription Refill system.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Since the release of patch PSO*7*146, Transitional Pharmacy Benefits 
(TPB), there has been an increase in the number of prescriptions which 
have a pharmacy patient status of Non-VA. Pharmacy's current AMIS Report 
option [PSO AMIS] and Daily AMIS Report option [PSO DAILY AMIS] do not 
include Non-VA prescriptions in any of their counts. 
This patch will modify the Compile AMIS Data (NIGHT JOB) option [PSO AMIS 
COMPILE] and the Recompile AMIS Data option [PSO AMIS RECOMPILE] to 
include the Non-VA prescription counts in a new NVA field (#17) in the 
DIVISION multiple (#59.11) of the OUTPATIENT AMIS DATA file (#59.1). 
Pharmacy's AMIS Report option [PSO AMIS] and Daily AMIS Report option 
[PSO DAILY AMIS] will be modified to display this field in a new NVA 
column.
 
If you install this patch and wish to include all past prescriptions with 
a Patient Status of Non-VA for past dates, you must run the Recompile 
AMIS Data option [PSO AMIS RECOMPILE].
 
Keep in mind that if you ran the AMIS report in the past, the counts will 
be different when you re-run the report for that past date, since the 
compile will now include prescriptions with a pharmacy patient status of 
Non-VA. Also note that the recompile is system intensive and should be 
run after hours.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This is the Outpatient Pharmacy patch for the Transitional Pharmacy Benefit
(TPB) project. This phase consists of automated processes and additional
tools designed to assist the sites for which Transitional Pharmacy Benefit
data have not been accurately reported.
  
Two of the most common events that have contributed to the discrepancies
in the TPB data are:
  
   a) TPB prescriptions have been entered for TPB eligible patients via the
      wrong Outpatient Pharmacy prescription processing options, such as
      the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR] option and Complete
      Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option.
  
   b) Patients who did not wish to take advantage of the TPB benefit or who are
      not prescribed medication after a VA appointment are still active for
      the TPB benefit in the system.  The inactivation of the TPB benefit is 
      automatic when the last active TPB prescription is discontinued either 
      through an Outpatient Pharmacy package action or through an action taken
      in CPRS. The entry of a prescription/order will not inactivate the 
      benefit unless the result is that the last active TPB prescription is
      discontinued as a result of the new entry. 
   
This patch is comprised of four components that will help the sites identify
and fix the data discrepancies described above. It will also provide them 
with new tools to monitor events that could have an impact on patient's TPB
eligibility. And in some cases the patient's TPB eligibity will be updated
automatically.
  
Below is a detailed description of each component:
 
   1) MARKING TPB PATIENT Rx's AS TPB (ONE-TIME PROCESS - POST INSTALL)
      -----------------------------------------------------------------
      Problem: Because some prescriptions have been entered through the
               wrong menu options (see item a) above), these Rx's have not 
               been correctly identified as TPB prescriptions. In other 
               words, they have a different patient status than "NON-VA" AND
               do not contain a TPB flag in PRESCRIPTION file (#52), and 
               therefore, are not identifiable as prescriptions filled
               under the TPB program.
 
      Solution: A Post-Install process will search for prescriptions filled
                under the TPB program which are not marked as such and
                will mark these prescriptions as TPB. The two requisites 
                that must be fulfilled for a prescription to be marked as 
                TPB, are:
    
                  a) The prescription was entered during the period that
                     the patient's TPB benefit was active.
 
                                      AND
 
                  b) The provider for the prescription is a "NON-VA"
                     provider.
                   
                If the requisites above are fulfilled, the following 
                updates will be done for the prescription:
 
                  a) Patient status will be changed to "NON-VA".
                  b) If an UNIQUE TPB clinic is identified (STOP CODE
                     equals 161) for the site, clinic will be changed to
                     this clinic.
                  c) The TPB flag will be set in PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
     
      Report: At the end of this process, a Mailman message will be sent
              to the newly created mail group called PSO TPB GROUP. The 
              patients reported on this message had at least one Prescription
              edited by the Post-Install process. The sites will have the
              ability to enter the coordinator of this new mail group at time
              of installation of this patch. Even if the coordinator is not
              entered, this patch assures that at least the installer of the
              patch is a member of the mail group. The fields reported on this
              Mailman message are: PATIENT NAME(LAST4SSN), Rx#, DRUG NAME, 
              PROVIDER NAME, CLINIC (Old and New) and the Rx PATIENT STATUS
              (Old and New).
   
      Important: If the site identifies prescriptions on this report that
                 have been wrongly flagged as TPB, it is possible to manually
                 remove the TPB flag from  such prescriptions through FileMan.
                 Just repeat the steps below for each prescription you wish
                 to remove the TPB flag (as in this example):
 
                 VA FileMan 22.0
    
                 Select OPTION: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES

                 Select PRESCRIPTION RX #: 123457690A  TYLENOL 250MG
                 TPB RX: YES// @
                    SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE? Y  (Yes)
    
  
   
   2) INACTIVATING PATIENT'S TPB BENEFIT (ONE-TIME PROCESS - POST INSTALL)
      --------------------------------------------------------------------
      Problem: Since not all patients eligible for the TPB program chose to
               take advantage of the TPB benefit or, after seeing the VA 
               provider the patient was not prescribed any medication, his/her
               TPB eligibility remained active, when in reality it should have 
               been inactivated.
  
      Solution: A Post-Install process will search for TPB eligible patients 
                and automatically inactivate the TPB eligibility of the 
                patients that fulfill both of the following
                requisites:
                   
                  a) Patient does not have any "active" TPB prescription(s) on
                     file. The prescription statuses considered as "active"
                     are the following:
                     ACTIVE, NON-VERIFIED, HOLD, DRUG INTERACTIONS, SUSPENDED
                     and PROVIDER HOLD.  
    
                                          AND
    
                  b) Patient has had an appointment at a designated TPB Clinic
                     (determined through a set of clinic stop codes) since the
                     date his/her TPB benefit began.
     
      Report: At the end of this process, a Mailman message will be sent to
              the new mail group PSO TPB GROUP. The patients reported on this 
              message were inactivated as TPB patients by the Post-Install
              process The fields reported on this message are: PATIENT NAME,
              LAST 4 DIGITS OF SSN, APPOINTMENT DATE/TIME, VA CLINIC NAME.
   
   3) PATIENT'S TPB BENEFIT INACTIVATION (ENHANCEMENT - CONTINUOUS PROCESS)
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      Outpatient Pharmacy software will be notified by the Scheduling software
      every time a patient has an appointment at a VA clinic. If the patient
      is eligible for the TPB benefit, the appointment was at a designated TPB 
      Clinic (determined through a set of clinic stop codes) AND the patient
      does not have any "active" (see list of statuses on item #2a above) TPB 
      prescription(s) on file, this patient will have the TPB eligibility 
      automatically inactivated. A Mailman message will be sent to the PSO TPB
      GROUP mail group with the following information:
       
          The following patient had the TPB (Transitional Pharmacy Benefit)
          Benefit automatically inactivated because the following appointment
          was found: 
   
                     Patient         : LAST,FIRST(9999)
                     VA Clinic       : EAST MIDWAY CLINIC
                     Appointment Date: DEC 02, 2003@11:15
  
   4) REPORT OF PATIENTS WITH TPB AND NON-TPB Rx's (NEW REPORT)
      [PSO TPB PATIENT RX REPORT]
      ---------------------------------------------------------
      This new report is being released as a stand-alone option. It will 
      print a list of TPB eligible patients that have "active" TPB and
      Non-TPB prescriptions on file. The report can be for ALL or selected 
      institutions, as well as for ALL or selected TPB patients. It will be
      sorted by the INSTITUTION NAME first, then by the PATIENT NAME. There
      will be a page-break for each individual institution. The column
      headings on the report are: PATIENT NAME (LAST4SSN), VA Rx#, TPB Rx#, 
      DRUG NAME. This report should be assigned to the site TPB Coordinator,
      Pharmacy ADPAC and any other individual deemed appropriate by the site.
      
In order to allow the unflagging of TPB prescriptions as described in 1) 
above, the TPB RX (#201) field in the PRESCRIPTION (#52) file is being 
changed from "UNEDITABLE" to "EDITABLE".

PSO*7*139 corrected the following problem:
    In some situations where a patient is being accessed by Inpatient
    Medications Version 5.0, if an attempt is made to finish orders in
    Outpatient Pharmacy Version 7.0, a message is received that the
    patient is in use. Then if an "^" is entered for the PATIENT STATUS
    prompt, the cross-reference entries in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55)
    could be deleted for that patient.
 
This patch has a post install clean-up routine that will:
 
1. Look for entries in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) affected by the
   problem above and will rebuild the missing cross-references.
 
2. Once the cross-reference is rebuilt for a specific patient, the post
   install will check if the patient has been merged and in case the
   patient's prescriptions still contain the old patient internal entry 
   number, it will correct them with the new patient number in the 
   PRESCRIPTION file (#52). The database problems caused by
   patient merges have been fixed by PSO*7*136, however, patient entries
   in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) with the problem above, could have
   been missed by PSO*7*136 cleanup job. 
   This step of this cleanup will make sure these entries are fixed.
 
During Installation of this patch the user will be asked: "Queue the
Post-Install to run at what Date@Time: ". If the prompt is not 
answered, the patch WILL NOT be installed. After the post install
routine is run to completion at the time the user indicated, a MailMan
message with the subject "PHARMACY PATIENT File (#55) missing entries"
containing the list of prescription cross-references rebuilt will be sent
to the person installing the patch. The prescriptions will then appear in
the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option and
the CPRS Meds Tab if they are not past their expiration date.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
There is one occasion where in the Outpatient Pharmacy application
where the PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS field content from one prescription 
can be carried over to another prescription automatically. This 
problem was identified in the Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE
FINISH] and Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR] menu 
options. The scenario that this problem happens is the following:
 
   Patient has Rx A, which is active and the Patient Instructions 
   field is not NULL (e.g. "FOR ALLERGIES"). Two new prescriptions
   are entered through through CPRS, Rx B and Rx C. Rx B is a 
   duplicate of Rx A. When finishing Rx B, an order check happens
   and Rx A is DC'd. Select Rx C and select to edit the Patient 
   Instructions field. If this field was NULL before, it will now
   show a default value, which is the content of the Patient 
   Instruction field from Rx A ("FOR ALLERGIES").
   
This problem will be corrected by installing this patch.

Application Programmer Interface calls (APIs) that will be used to get the
patient appointment information from the new GOTS database. This is the
Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 patch that replaces all direct references to
the patient appointment information in the Action Profile (132 COLUMN

it also shows discontinued med orders. This patch ensures that if the
cutoff days is zero, only the active med orders will be listed. For
all other cutoff days the report will show the discontinued and expired

   When using the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
   option to edit the dispensed drug on an active order, if there is more
   than one drug tied to that Orderable item, if a different drug is
   selected from the displayed drug list, the software prompts 'Do You
   want to Edit the SIG? NO//'. On selecting 'Yes' you are prompted for
   these fields: dosage, verb, dispense unit, noun, route, schedule,
   duration or the conjunction. If changes are made to any of these
   fields, you are prompted  'Are You Sure You Want to Update Rx 999999?
   Yes//'. When selecting 'Yes', the software does not update the changes.
   This patch fixes this problem.
 
2. MOU-1202-31080
   Using Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option,
   when the drug of an active order is edited, the software checks for the
   change and prompts 'Do You want to Edit the SIG? NO//' and accordingly
   alerts the user with the message 'This change will create a new
   prescription!'. During the completion process of new orders entered
   through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), if the drug is
   edited, the software currently does not make any such checks on the
   edited drug. This patch ensures that the same functionality that is
   provided to the drug edits of an active order, is incorporated into the
   drug edits during the completion of orders entered through CPRS.
   Also the completion of pending order process is enhanced in this patch
   to display the message "Pending Order Not Updated!" in the message box
   when an up-arrow (^) is entered at any of the dosage prompts to quit
   the process. This is similar to "Prescription Not Updated!" message
   that is provided when quitting during an edit of an active order with
   an up-arrow (^).

4. HWH-0303-40364
   When entering complex orders using Patient Prescription Processing
   [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, if an up-arrow (^) and 3 characters
   are entered at the conjunction prompt in order to correct one of the
   dosage fields, the software goes into an endless loop going back to the
   beginning of the complex dosage. This happens only if the 3 characters
   entered do not point to one of the dosage fields. This patch fixes this
   problem. We also fixed the following related issue: Currently, to jump
   to the Limited Duration field within the dosage edit, you need to enter
   "^DUR" or "^dur", not "^LIM" or "^lim", as expected by many users. This
   patch provides the option of entering "^LIM" or "^lim" or "^DUR" or 
   "^dur", to jump to the Limited Duration field.
 
5. SBY-0503-30615
   Using Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option,
   when the Orderable Item of an active order is edited to a different

   the order checking. During order checking process if it encounters any
   drug interactions with other active prescriptions, it will display the
   following:
 
     '***CRITICAL*** Drug Interaction with RX #9999999'
     'DRUG: ASPIRIN BUFFERED 325MG TAB' (the drug it had interaction with)
     'Do you want to Continue? Y// '.
 
   At this prompt if you enter 'No' or up-arrow (^), or you enter 'Yes'
   and for the next prompt 'Do you want to Process medication METHOTREXATE
   2.5MG TAB: P// ?', (drug that is tied to the Orderable Item you

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The Chief Business Office (CBO) is requesting modifications to several
Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
packages to support implementation of VHA Directive 2002-049 - "Combat
Veterans Are Eligible For Medical Services For 2-Years After Separation
From Military Service Notwithstanding Lack Of Evidence For Service
Connection", which iterates VA's policy to provide medical care and other
medical services to combat veterans despite the absence of proof of
service connection.
 
Software to support the Combat Veteran (CV) initiative is being developed
and introduced in a phased implementation strategy. The reason for this
type of deployment is due to the complexity of the functionality and the
number of product line dependencies. Phase I: Combat Veteran Interim
Solution (CVIS) was a VistA only solution that involved development in
the Integrated Billing (IB) and Registration/Enrollment product lines.
It provided the logic to identify those veterans who met the criteria for
the combat veteran eligibility and provided billing reports
cross-referenced against this identifier to aid in the copayment billing
process. Phase II of this initiative will involve multiple product lines
and additional VistA only development. The main goals of Phase II will be
to fully automate the copayment billing processing of combat vets based on
episode of care by providing the appropriate questions at check-out as
supplied by CPRS.
 
Product lines that have a stake in Phase II development include
Enrollment/Registration (VistA), IB, Outpatient Pharmacy, Consolidated
Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP), CPRS/TIU, Patient Care Encounter (PCE),
Ambulatory Care, Event Capture, Scheduling and PTF. The National Patient
Care Database (NPCD) will also require modifications to capture workload
reporting. The patches are listed below in the order that they must be
installed:
Outpatient Pharmacy
    PSO*7*157
    PSX*2*50
PCE/PTF/Event Capture/Scheduling  - PIMS Host file
    PX*1.0*130
    SD*5.3*325
    DG*5.3*565
    EC*2.0*54
Integrated Billing
    IB*2.0*247
CPRS
    OR*3.0*190
Product Features
There are three main areas addressed by this enhancement:
a. Identification/Notification of a CV Status veteran seeking medical care
   - The clinical applications shall obtain the CV Status for those
     veterans who qualify as such per the directive.
   - The CV Status identification shall be displayed to the appropriate
     audience (pharmacist, clinician providing care, intake personnel,
     schedulers, etc.).
   - Provider shall be able to identify whether care provided CV veteran
     was for a condition potentially related to combat service in the same
     manner as identification of exposure related care; care for SC
     conditions, etc.
b. Assistance in the communication of a treatment being determined as
   Combat Related
   - Provide a means for the billing and pharmacy software package to
     identify these patients and services provided care for a combat
     related condition.
c. Automatically precludes inpatient and outpatient medical care,
   prescription and Long-term care copayments for CV Status veterans whose
   treatment/service has been deemed combat related.
 
This is the Outpatient Pharmacy patch PSO*7*157 that provides the
functionality changes to accommodate the new copay classification called
"Combat Veteran".
 
1. For the following options, when creating a new order, renewing an
existing order, copying an existing order to a new order, or editing an
existing order that results in a new order, the copay status of the
prescription needs to be determined for billing purposes.
 
a. Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
b. TPB Rx (Prescription) Entry [PSO TPB RX ENTRY]
c. Barcode Batch Prescription Entry [PSO BATCH BARCODE]
d. Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH]
 
Depending on the patient eligibility, the software currently provides
the following copay exemption questions to the pharmacist during
prescription finishing process:
 
"Is this Rx for treatment of Vietnam-Era Herbicide (Agent Orange)
exposure?"
 
"Is this Rx for treatment of ionizing radiation exposure?"
 
"Is this Rx for treatment of environmental contaminant exposure during the
Persian Gulf War?"
 
"Is this Rx for treatment of Military Sexual Trauma?"
 
"Is this Rx related to treatment of Head and/or Neck Cancer?"
and/or Neck Cancer veterans;
 
To fulfill the Directive 2002-049, this patch will add the following
Combat Veteran (CV) copay exemption question to the current copay list:
 
"Is this Rx potentially for treatment related to Combat?"
 
In the event that a patient is eligible for more than one copay
exemption, the CV prompt will be presented to the pharmacist first.
 
A 'YES' or 'NO' response will be stored in the COMBAT VETERAN field
(#122) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52). This is a new field introduced in
this patch.
 
2. The Integration Agreement (IA) 2534 provides CPRS the copay related
questions that need to be asked during the outpatient medication order
entry process. This IA is modified to include the CV copay classification,
if applicable.
 
3. The PENDING OUTPATIENT ORDERS file (#52.41) that stores the pharmacy
orders (new/renew) entered via CPRS is modified to include the provider
response to the CV question. The provider response will be stored in the
COMBAT VETERAN field (#110.1) of the PENDING OUTPATIENT ORDERS file
(#52.41). The COMBAT VETERAN field (#110.1) is a new field introduced in
this patch.
 
4. During the release of a prescription, medication copay exemptions are
re-evaluated to see if there is a change in the billing status. This logic
is modified to include the CV copay classification. If a copay exemption
question applies and is unanswered, a MailMan message is generated. This
message is sent to the pharmacist, ordering provider, and holders of the
PSO COPAY key, to get answers to the exemption questions and reset the
prescription copay status if needed, using the Reset Copay Status/Cancel
Charges [PSOCP RESET COPAY STATUS] option .
 
5. The Reset Copay Status/Cancel Charges [PSOCP RESET COPAY STATUS] option
is modified to include the CV copay classification wherever applicable.
 
6. During label printing of a prescription, if a prescription is deemed
billable then the software does a check on the following copay exemption
fields of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52):

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch will fix two similar issues regarding missing text
on the printed prescription labels.
 
The two issues this patch resolves are:
 
1.  When printing prescription labels there is a potential that part 
    of the Narrative Text lines will be truncated.  Modifications
    have been made to resolve this problem while preserving the 
    narrative text format entered by the customer.  The text that 
    was previously truncated will now be moved to a new line.
 
2.  When printing prescription labels there is a potential that some 
    lines will be skipped from printing on the prescription in the
    warning label section.  This issue was happening in rare cases
    when lines in the warning label had been deleted and new lines
    were added.  Modifications have been made to print the warning
    labels lines when this scenario is encountered.

   An internal problem in the software was causing the content of the
   comment field, entered when a prescription was discontinued, to be 
   replaced by a 0 (zero). This problem was detected when printing the
   Activity Log for the discontinued prescription. The comment field for
   the DISCONTINUED activity was displaying a 0 (zero) instead of the 
   original comments entered by the user who discontinued the
   prescription. Once this patch is installed this problem will be
   resolved.

   Once this patch is installed this problem will be resolved.

Joint Commission for Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)
requires that patients' use of OTC medications, Herbal supplements,
medications prescribed by the VA but purchased by the patient at an
outside pharmacy, and medications prescribed by providers outside the VA
be documented in patients' medical records.  These four categories of
medications will hereafter be referred to as Non-VA Meds. In September
2002, a team with members from different applications was put together to
come up with a national solution to address this requirement. The
applications involved in this project are Computerized Patient Record
System (CPRS), Outpatient Pharmacy, Pharmacy Data Management, Inpatient
Medications and National Drug File (NDF).

This patch addresses the problem introduced by the Outpatient Pharmacy
patch PSO*7*155.
 
In the Action Profile (132 COLUMN PRINTOUT) [PSO ACTION PROFILE] option,
the print by 'Clinic' function was not working correctly after installing
the patch PSO*7*155. One of the problems was related to queuing the report
to the printer. The report would show on the screen instead of the
printer. It also resolves the problem "device or file not open" reported
in NOISs LEB-0404-21298 and NCH-0404-41348. This patch fixes all problems
introduced by patch PSO*7*155.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 If a Pharmacist selects Multiple prescriptions in the Patient
 Prescription option ([PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]) and one or more of these
 prescriptions are 'Pending', the possibility exists that another
 Pharmacist could have previously run the Complete Orders from OERR
 ([PSO LMOE FINISH]) option and already selected one of these orders to
 finish.  Locking on the pending order does not occur until the
 pharmacist pulls up that order to edit it. Once an order is finished,
 it is removed from the PENDING OUTPATIENT ORDERS file (#54.21). If the
 very last entry in the pending file is the one being finished by the
 other pharmacist, once it is removed, the next entry added to the 
 ending file will contain the same internal entry number. If this new
 entry is a new order  (instead of a discontinued order or something
 else), when the first pharmacist gets to that item from his selection
 list, the information that is displayed is from the "New" order. So the
 pharmacist could unknowingly finish the prescription thinking it was
 for the patient that he is viewing on the profile . The order does get
 filed under the correct patient, just not the patient that the 1st
 pharmacist was processing. This patch corrects this problem by
 verifying that the pending order is for the same patient that the
 pharmacist is viewing.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The VistA Fee Basis Package will be replaced by a new application in a 
phased approach. The new application will be hosted by the Health 
Administration Center, which is located at Denver, CO. A future phase of 
the VistA Fee replacement project will have the pharmacy invoices entered 
and processed using the Fee replacement system.
 
The Nightly Management Data Compile Job [PSO MGMT NIGHTLY COMPILE] option
is scheduled to run nightly. This option populates the OUTPATIENT PHARMACY
MANAGEMENT DATA file (#59.12) with cost related data from the PRESCRIPTION
file (#52), and the local VistA FEE BASIS PHARMACY INVOICE file (#162.1)
for fee basis patients. Accessing the FEE BASIS PHARMACY INVOICE file
(#162.1) by Outpatient Pharmacy is provided by Integration Agreement (IA)
203. With the VistA Fee Basis Package migrating to a new platform, the Fee
Basis Encapsulation project is replacing IA 203 with IA 4395. IA 4395 will
provide Outpatient Pharmacy with the fee basis prescription count and cost
data either from the local VistA Fee Basis file or from the Fee 
Replacement system. This will isolate the Outpatient Pharmacy from future
changes as the fee replacement system is implemented. This patch will
modify the Nightly Management Data Compile Job [PSO MGMT NIGHTLY COMPILE]
option, to make a call to the new API, $$RXSUM^FBRXUTL(), documented by IA
4395 that provides the fee basis prescription count and cost for a given
date.
As the VistA Fee Basis Package is moving towards a National database, the
new API may also return a string value of 
"-1^exception_number^exception_text", indicating an exception has 
occurred. To accommodate this exception, this patch will also generate a
new mail message to the holders of the PSORPH security key. Following is
an example of this mail message:

Note:
The Cost of Prescriptions [PSO MGMT REPORT RX COSTS] option and the Cost
of Prescriptions [PSO MGMT MONTHLY RX COSTS] option, provides the daily
and monthly prescription cost report. While testing this patch it was
observed that the average participating pharmacy prescription cost under
the column heading "AVG PARTIC PHARM RX", was incorrect and displays a
zero value even with data present. This patch fixes this problem.

   Currently, if the NARCOTICS NUMBERED DIFFERENTLY (#1000) field in the
   OUTPATIENT SITE (#59) file is set to Yes, all prescriptions that have
   a drug with a DEA, SPECIAL HDLG (#3) field if file DRUG (#50) that contains
   an "A" (Narcotics) are numbered differently than other prescriptions.  This
   patch will change the check of the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG (#3) field in
   the DRUG (#50) file to check for all Schedule II drugs, denoted by
   a "2" in the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG (#3) field, instead of just an "A".

   The functionality exists to modify the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG (#3) field
   of the DRUG (#50) file to contain an "F".  This code signifies that
   this drug in not refillable.  If the # OF REFILLS (#9) field of the
   PRESCRIPTION (#52) file is modified after the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG (#3)
   field has been changed to an "F", the # OF REFILLS (#9) field for
   the prescription is automatically reset to 0.  This is causing the
   prescription display to show the 'Refills Remaining' as a negative
   number. This patch will change how this situation is handled.  If a
   prescription has refills and the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG (#3) field has been
   changed to include an "F", the # OF REFILLS (#9) field will be changed to
   the actual number of refills given and the following message will be
   displayed:
   "The drug has been changed and no longer allows refills."
   If no refills had been given, the # OF REFILLS (#9) field will be set to
   0 and the following message will be displayed:
   "No refills allowed on this drug."
 
3. FGH-1203-31351
   If a prescription was transmitted to CMOP, then put on hold, it
   removes the fill date. It is then released and when the hold is
   removed, it does not prompt for a fill date since it is released,
   therefore the possibility exists that if the Fill Date is blank the
   subsequent fills will be rejected by the CMOP transmission.
   This patch will prompt the user for a fill date with a default of
   the released date if a prescription is unheld after it is released
   and fill date field is blank.

 There are three patches to support the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation 
 Interface project. These patches should be installed separately in the 
 following order: 
                   PSO*7*156      Outpatient Pharmacy 
                   PSS*1*82       Pharmacy Data Management 
                   PSN*4*84       National Drug File 
 
 They contain routines, templates, options, and data dictionary changes to 
 implement the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface features.  Please 
 refer to the individual patch description of the other patches to get the 
 names of the documentation files.  
 
 Each patch will share the same starting description with more detail 
 for each patch in the corresponding namespace patch number.  There is 
 only one installation guide.  It can be found on the anonymous 
 directory.  The name of the installation guide is 
 PS_OUTPATIENT_AUTOMATION_INTERFACE_IG.doc.  
 
 
 The patch enhances the current Health Level Seven (HL7) interface to 
 ensure that the interface is compatible with all current Outpatient 
 Pharmacy V. 7.0 automation systems used by the Veterans Affairs 
 Medical Centers (VAMCs).  The current national VISTA HL7 interface is 
 written to HL7 standard V. 2.2.  Automated dispensing systems, such as 
 the Baker APS Pharmacy 2000, are currently using an interface written to 
 V. 2.3.1 standard using locally developed software.  The automated 
 dispensing systems have committed to be HL7 V. 2.4 compliant.  
 
 This patch includes the following new features: 
 1. Enhance the current Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 HL7 interface to 
    the current HL7 V. 2.4 standard.  
 2. Creates a bi-directional interface.  The interface transmits 
    outpatient pharmacy data to multiple vendor systems utilized by VAMCs 
    and receives dispensed prescription data from the vendor systems.  
 3. The dispense completion message received back from the vendor will 
    automatically release the prescription in VISTA if the FILE RELEASE 
    DATE/TIME field (#105.1) is set to YES in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52).  
 4. The interface sends outpatient pharmacy prescription release 
    information to the vendor once a prescription is manually released.  
 5. The BusinessWare interface engine at each medical center is used 
    to pass the HL7 data through from VISTA to the dispensing system.  
    There is no data manipulation on BusinessWare's part.  
 6. Enhance the activity log entries for the sequence of events for a 
    prescription's activity in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52).  
 7. Add a fourth selection to the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59), EXTERNAL 
    INTERFACE field (#5).  This selection is titled 'SEND MARKED ORDERS 
    AND PRINT LABEL'.  
 8. This patch allows dispensing system printer(s) to be entered and used
    when selected, and the interface is in use, sending an HL7 message
    to the dispensing system.
 9. This patch added new functionality for reprinting Rxs and using the 
    external interface.  If a reprint of an Rx is requested the user is 
    asked if they want to resend the Rx to the external interface.

PATCH OVERVIEW
Gail Graham, Director of Information Assurance requested that a process
of Patient Identity Management (PIM) be created that uniquely identifies a
patient prior to providing care. In order for the Health Data Repository
(HDR) to receive clinical data about patients the patient must have an
Integration Control Number (ICN) and Treating Facility (TF) List. VistA
under certain circumstances allows backdoor entry of clinical activity to
be recorded for a patient without "requiring" a patient to have an ICN.
The immediate needs of the HDR have identified several issues within the
existing PIM to uniquely identify patients through the ICN enumeration
process. PIM services are tied into VistA at several points. In the
current VistA structure, up front identity management is done only within
Registration via several different menu options, as that has been the
traditional entry point of patients into the system. In addition, there
are "hooks" within Appointment Management, which assign a local ICN after
the patient has received care. Subsequently, the national ICN is obtained
through a nightly job or via manual resolution of the local ICN. The
requester states that the current method does not support good business
practices for updating patient identity traits at appropriate entry points
and does not provide the full functionality of the benefit of the ICN in
linking all patient data together.
 
This is the Outpatient Pharmacy patch PSO*7*185 that places the ICN check
(hooks) within the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 options, to dynamically
assign a local ICN for a patient if one was not found.
 
Outpatient Pharmacy will not make any changes to options where the
patient look up is done via the FileMan DIC call on the PATIENT file
(#2). As part of the PIM project, the Master Patient Index V. 1.0 package
will send out a separate patch that will have the ICN "hooks" in place.
 
In Outpatient Pharmacy, the following options do not use the standard
patient lookup (FileMan DIC call on the PATIENT file (#2)), as the
primary input for selecting orders.
 
Release Medication [PSO RELEASE]
Return Medication to Stock [PSO RETURNED STOCK]
Reset Copay Status/Cancel Charges [PSOCP RESET COPAY STATUS]
Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH]
Barcode Batch Prescription Entry [PSO BATCH BARCODE]
Discontinue Prescription(s) [PSO C]
Edit Prescriptions [PSO RXEDIT]
Reprint an Outpatient Rx Label [PSO RXRPT]
View Prescriptions [PSO VIEW]
Pull Early from Suspense [PSO PNDRX]
 
For these options, a check is put in place to see if the INTEGRATION
CONTROL NUMBER (ICN) field (#991.01) of the PATIENT file (#2) is populated
by calling the API #2701, $$GETICN^MPIF001(DFN). If it is not populated
then a call is made to the API #3300, $$MPIQQ^MPIFAPI(DFN) that will
populate the INTEGRATION CONTROL NUMBER (ICN) field (#991.01) of the
PATIENT file (#2).
 
Note: This patch also carries a fix for NOIS PAL-0804-60841.
Patch PSO*7*175 - FEE REPLACEMENT ENCAPSULATION PROJECT, calls the API
#4395, $$RXSUM^FBRXUTL(DATE,STATION_NUMBER), to collect the fee basis
prescription count and cost for a given date and the approving Veterans
Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) station number. The station number that is
passed to the API is the STATION NUMBER field (#99) of the INSTITUTION
file (#4), which constitutes a 3 digit station number plus any modifiers.
The API #4395 requires only the first 3 digits of the station number
otherwise it will return an error message, "Valid station number not
specified". This patch fixes this problem.

The routine PSOVDFK is used as the KIDS Post-Install routine to install 
specific components for the Outpatient Pharmacy package in several VDEF
namespace globals that VDEF uses to construct a message.  It uses the VDEF
API POSTKID^VDEFVU to do this.  The specific components that are sent to
Post-install routine are:
 
1.      HL7 Message Type
2.      HL7 Event Type
3.      VistA Domain Subtype
4.      HL7 Protocol Event Driver name

6.      Name of the routine that does the message extraction
7.      VDEF Event Description
8.      VDEF Event Subtype description
 
The POSTKID^VDEFVU routine uses the components to create event-specific
parameters in VDEF files.
 
The patch cannot be installed until VDEF 1.00 is installed. 
 
 
** IMPORTANT **
 
Sites should not install this software prior to your assigned HDR
installation date; doing so may cause complications with your BCMA
application with versions prior to PSB*3*4. You will be contacted
approximately two weeks prior to your HDR installation date and provided
with instructions on when and in what order to install these patches and
the VDEF software. Additionally, sites should not configure or attempt to
utilize the VDEF software associated with these patches prior to your
assigned HDR installation date, at which time Technical Support Office
personnel will work with you to activate that application and start your
data transmissions to the HDR database. (If you do not know your HDR
installation date, you can find that information by going to 
&lt;http://vaww.teamshare.domain.ext/hdr_implementation/&gt; and selecting 
"Implementation Schedule" from the Quick Launch panel on the left side of

This patch is part of the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 Laser Labels
Phase II project for printing prescription labels.
 
***** NOTE TO SITES USING AUTOMATED FILLING EQUIPMENT *****
This patch changes the format and content of the laser labels print 
stream. If you are using automated dispensing equipment that relies on 
the data stream sent to the laser labels port, you have 2 options:
  1. Implement the Outpatient Automation Interface (OPAI) (available with
     released patch PSO*7*156) or 
  2. Contact your vendor to make adjustments based on the new data stream.
 
Although implementing OPAI is not mandated at this time, it is expected 
to be in the future, so option 1 is the preferred solution. By 
implementing OPAI, future changes to the label format will not affect the 
dispensing equipment interface.
*************************************************************************
 
To fully implement all portions of the new functionality, the 
following are needed:
  1. Patch PSS*1*87 from Pharmacy Data Management V. 1.0 (PDM),to provide 
an API for retrieving warning labels from the new data source.
  2. Patches PSN*4*86 and PSN*4*88 from the National Drug File V. 4.0
(NDF) to create and populate a new gender field in the WARNING
LABEL-ENGLISH file (#50.625) and the WARNING LABEL-SPANISH file (#50.626).
  3. Patch PSX*2*54 from the Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy V. 2.0
(CMOP) to modify the way warnings are sent to CMOP.
 
 
 This patch includes:
  1. Referencing a new commercial data source for printing prescription 
warning labels.        
  2. Printing warning labels and Patient Information Sheets (PMI) by the
patient's PMI language preference setting.
  3. A new MAILING COMMENTS field (#.081) is added to the OUTPATIENT SITE
file (#59.7) to be used for a site to enter anything they would like to 
show on the Mail Address label. (i.e. whether mailing is "Forwarding 
service requested" or  "Address service requested"). The PSO SITE INPUT 
TEMPLATE for the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59.7) is changed to allow the 
input of data into the new mailing comments.
  4. A new Manual Print of Multi-Rx Forms [PSO LM MULTI-RX PRINT] option
is added under the Rx (Prescriptions) [PSO RX] option as well as under 
the OTH hidden action while in the patient's profile to reprint the 
Multi-Rx Refill Request form on laser label stock without having to
reprint the entire prescription's labels. The functionality is also
changed to stop printing the Multi-Rx refill form on reprints.
  5. Various changes to the content/format of the labels - detailed below
under each label section.
  6. Correction to only print one ScripTalk label when SIG is continued.
(NOIS CLE-0304-40723. (The other part of this NOIS is addressed in patch
PSO*7*182, so this NOIS is not included in the associated patch list 
below)).
  7. A new Signature Log Reprint [PSO SIGLOG REPRINT] option is added
under the Rx (Prescriptions) [PSO RX] option. (Added for HIPAA/NCPDP).
  8. A change was made to not keep exact duplicates of the control code 
settings (e.g. when running the set-up routine as a test site and again 
when the patch is installed in production). NOIS PUG-1103-52110
  9. The other NOIS's listed below were for items already included in the
Laser Labels Phase II specifications.
 
Bottle label section changes:
============================
  1. Currently long SIG's that do not fit on one bottle label print only 4
lines of SIG on the first bottle label and up to 4 lines on each 
continuation label. This patch increases the number of lines of the SIG 
that print on each bottle label to reduce the total number of labels
needed. This also will allow the overlapping of the multiple labels on the
bottle to eliminate the need for cutting the labels to make them fit.
  2. The text "Mfr_________" will print for all prescriptions on the same 
line as the "Discard after" information.
  3. The text "May refill nX by MMM DD,YYYY" or "NO REFILLS LEFT" or "NO 
REFILL" was added between the "Discard after..." line and the Qty: line.
  4. On the trailing documents, a signature log will print in the bottle 
label section for the patient to sign for the medications received. 
(Added for HIPAA/NCPDP).
  
Warning label section changes:
=============================
  1. A new API will be called to determine which warnings to print.
  2. Warnings will print in English or Spanish depending on the patient's 
PMI preference.
  3. If there are fewer than five warning labels, the warning labels will 
be bottom-justified.
  4. If the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) in the DRUG file (#50) begins
with numbers 1,2,3,4 or 5. The NO TRANSFER warning label from the RX
CONSULT file (#54) entry number 20 will print in the appropriate 
language.
  5. The new data source contains some lengthy warnings, especially the 
Spanish translation. For the smallest font, this patch allows a 4th line
of text to print, if needed.
  6. The top warning label was sometimes printing on or over the 
perforated line. For some fonts, this patch reduces the white space 
between the lines of the first warning to make it fit.
 
Mail address section changes:
============================
  1. The current date will print in the upper right corner.
  2. If there are any mailing comments defined, they will print after the 
MAIL field (#.03) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55).
  3. Patient name will print first name first instead of 
lastname,firstname.
  4. When the routing is "Window", the word "Window" will be bolded.
 
Pharmacy fill card section changes:
==================================
  1. Seconds will be removed from the label date/time.
  2. A new API will return the text for the DRUG WARNING list. The DRUG 
WARNING entries will be separated by commas. If an entry in the list does 
not have an "N" (for "New"), it is from the RX CONSULT file (#54).
Otherwise it is from the WARNING LABEL-ENGLISH (#50.625) or the 
WARNING LABEL-SPANISH (#50.626) file.
  3. A new line containing the patient location and status is being added
beneath the DRUG WARNING list, so the list is being moved up slightly on
the label.
  4. Patient name and last portion of the social security number are 
bolded.
  5. If the bottle cap is "non-safety", it will be bolded.
  6. Currently long SIG's that do not fit on one pharmacy fill card label
print only 4 lines of SIG on the first label and up to 4 lines on each
continuation label. This patch increases the number of lines of the SIG 
that print on each pharmacy fill card label to reduce the total number of
labels needed.
  7. The words "3rd Party Rx" and the NDC number are added when that 
information is available. (Added for HIPAA/NCPDP).
 
Patient fill section changes:
============================
  1. The barcode will print every time even if there are no refills.
  2. The site telephone number will print when the "PHONE IN OR MAIL THIS 
REFILL REQUEST" prints.
  3. The text "n refills left until MMM DD,YYYY is changed to "May refill 
nX by MMM DD,YYYY".
 
Prescription Document PMI section changes:
=========================================
  1. The PMI will print in the patient's language preference.
  2. The white spaces between sections of the PMI document will be 
reduced to result in a few more lines fitting on the page.
  3. If there are more than 5 warning labels, the additional warnings 
will print at the top of the PMI section.
 
Trailing document changes:
=========================
  1. The patient's phone number followed by an underline will print on 
the address change form.
  2. In the Allergies/ADR section, the name and last six digits of the 
social security number will be made larger and will be bolded.
  3. In the Allergies/ADR section, if the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44), 
TYPE field (#2) type equals "W" for any prescription printed for this 
patient in the current print job, then the word "INPATIENT" will print 
on the line following the patient name.
  4. In the Allergies/ADR section, if some sections do not have data, the 
header will not print. If no information exists, "No Assessment Made" 
will print after the Verified Allergies heading.
  5. In the refill narrative or copay narrative sections, if there are 
more than seven lines from the original text, only the first seven lines 
will print. (They could appear as more than seven lines if there is some 
wrapping of the text).
  6. If the Multi-Rx refill section is blank, the SITE NUMBER field 
(#.06) from the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) will print bottom right
justified.
 
A utility routine is included in this patch to change some of the control
codes in the TERMINAL TYPE file (#3.2). 
Once the patch is installed, running the routine PSOLLU4 in programmer
mode will make slight adjustments to PATIENT FILL INITIALIZATION, 
PHARMACY FILL DOCUMENT WARNING, MAILING LABEL INITIALIZATION, and RETURN 
MAIL INITIALIZATION settings.
Note: you must have your FileMan access set to '@' to run the routine.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. My HealtheVet team in preparation for the My HealtyVet V. 1.0
    package (Internet Prescription Refill project), requested an
    additional Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 Application Program Interface
    (API) #4687, to provide details of all (active, verified, on hold,
    suspended, discontinued, pending and expired), prescriptions for a
    patient within a given date.
 
 2. Also the existing API #3768 has been modified to provide the following
    status for Internet refill requests (used internally):
 
    Calling AP1 component will return the following status:
 
   -5      DFN does not match RX
   -4      Unable to resolve patient
   -3      Unable to resolve prescription
   -2      Status is pending
   -1      Result is back but not picked up
    0      Other error
    1      Filed in PRESCRIPTION REFILL REQUEST file (#52.43)
 
    Calling AP2 component will return the following status:
 
    -6     RX not in file #52.43
    -5     DFN does not match RX
    -4     Unable to resolve patient
    -3     Unable to resolve prescription
    -2     Status is pending
    -1     Result is back but not picked up
     1     Filled
     2     Not Filled
     n^x   n - Date the refill request was processed.
           x - The result of the processing. This will be either FILLED or
               NOT FILLED.
 
     Calling AP5 component will return the following status:
 
     -6     RX not in file #52.43
     -4     Unable to resolve patient
     -3     Unable to resolve prescription
     -2     Status is pending
      0     The update was not successful. This will occur if any of the
            information provided (DFN, RX #) are invalid.
      1     The update was successful.
 
 3. A new PATIENT field (#9) was added to the PRESCRIPTION REFILL REQUEST
    file (#52.43) that is a pointer to the PAITENT file (#2).  A new
    "AC" cross reference was added, to index the file by PATIENT field
    (#9) and PRESCRIPTION IEN field (#8). The existing "AA", and "AB"
    cross references were removed.
 
 Note: This patch carries a Pre-install routine that will delete the
 Data Dictionary (DD) of the PRESCRIPTION REFILL REQUEST file (#52.43)
 before the install of the new DD. This file is not in use currently,
 however, it will not destroy any data in the test systems.
 For more details, please refer to the installation guide or the technical
 manual of the My HealthyVet V. 1.0 package.

This patch is a follow up for Outpatient Pharmacy Clinical Indicator Data
Capture (CIDC) patch PSO*7*143.
 
Functional Description:
----------------------
This Outpatient Pharmacy patch PSO*7*219 corrects the following issues:
 
1.  The Application Program Interface (API) that is provided to 
Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) with the service connection (SC)
and environmental indicator (EI) questions was not set correctly for non
service connected (NSC) patients, as a result the following issues were
reported:
 
a. In CPRS, the SC related questions were incorrectly prompted for NSC
patients, and it should not have done so. It should prompt SC/EI question
only if applicable.(remedy ticket 114219).
 
b. Holders of the PSO COPAY key, the ordering provider, and the finishing
pharmacist were receiving increased volumes of mailman messages in 
Outpatient Pharmacy.  Mailman messages were incorrectly sent for NSC
patients upon refill, new, and renewed orders (remedy ticket 114219).
These messages have been eliminated.  Mailman messages will still be
generated for the following scenarios:
 
                 SC percentage
                 - age changed   E/I question
     Type        to &gt;0%          added?          Mailman Message sent?
     ---------   --------------  -------------   -------------------------
     NSC         N               N               N        
 
     NSC         N               Y               Y only if question was
                                                     not answered before
                                                     the prescription is
                                                     released
 
     NSC         Y               N/A             Y if question was not
                                                     answered before the
                                                     prescription is
                                                     released
 
     SC=&gt;0%&lt;50%  N/A             Y               Y  however, NO mailman
                                                      message will be sent
                                                      if any SC/EI = YES
                                                      on the original
                                                      prescription 
 
     For SC&gt;50% prescriptions and if patient has a new SC/EI added, the
     appropriate questions will be asked upon RENEW or COPY of the
     original prescription. At release, a MailMan message will not be sent
     if the patient, patient status, or drug is exempt from copay.
 
Because the information requested by these Mailman messages are used to 
determine the final VA copay and/or insurance billable status, the text 
and format has changed.  The subject line was changed from "RX COPAY 
STATUS REVIEW NEEDED" to "PRESCRIPTION QUESTIONS REVIEW NEEDED" and the
body of the message has additional information.  Also, the eligibility and
disability information is now included after the patient name. The
following is an example:

37 lines
From: OUTPATIENT PHARMACY PACKAGE  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1  *New*

Due to a change in criteria, additional information listed below is needed
to determine the final VA copay and/or insurance billable status for this 
Rx so that appropriate action can be taken by pharmacy personnel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
This message has been sent to the provider of record, the pharmacist who
finished the prescription order, and all holders of the PSO COPAY key.
 
Providers:
Please respond with your answer to the question(s) as a reply to this
message. The prescription will be updated by the appropriate staff.
 
Staff assigned to update the Prescription responses:
Please use the RESET COPAY STATUS/CANCEL CHARGES option to enter the 
responses to the questions above, which may result in a Rx copay status
change and/or the need to remove VA copay charges or may result in a
charge to the patient's insurance carrier.
 
Note: The SC question is now asked for Veterans who are SC&gt;49% in order to
determine if the Rx can be billed to a third party insurance. These 
Veterans will NOT be charged a VA copay.
 
Supply and investigational drugs are not charged a VA copay but could be
reimbursable by third party insurance.
 
Enter message action (in IN basket): Ignore// 
 
c.  In CPRS, SC/EI related questions were not asked for supply items 
and investigational drugs (remedy ticket 11421). CPRS and backdoor 
Outpatient Pharmacy users will be required to complete SC/EI questions for
supplies and investigational drugs. Supply items and investigational drugs
could be reimbursable by third party insurance. Also, a VA copay will not
be charged for these.
 
2.  During use of Complete Orders from OERR option [PSO LMOE FINISH], the
default answers for SC/EI's for CPRS SC&gt;50% renewed orders were
occasionally displaying the previous orders answers during the finish
process.  A modification was made to display the SC/EI information entered
during the CPRS renewal process.  This anomaly was encountered during
unit testing, and there is no associated remedy ticket.
 
3.  For renewal orders in Complete Orders from OERR option [PSO LMOE 
FINISH] and Patient Prescription Processing option [PSO LM BACKDOOR 
ORDERS], a message was erroneously displayed after the SC/EI prompts for
SC&gt;50% prescriptions.  The following is an example of the message
displayed when eligibility is changed or the user enters an up arrows (^)
at an outpatient classification prompt.  Note that the bracketed
information can be SERVICE CONNECTED or NON SERVICE CONNECTED depending
upon the user's response to the question.  Or if the user up arrows (^)
out of the prompt, the default answer determines the value.
 
           Was treatment for a Service Connected condition? YES// ^
           This Renewal has been designated as [SERVICE CONNECTED]
           Please use the 'Reset Copay Status/Cancel Charges' option to
           make corrections.
 
The "Please use the 'Reset Copay Status/Cancel Charges' option to make
corrections" sentence will no longer be displayed for supply items,
investigational drugs, and SC&gt;50% patients.  The first sentence will
remain in order to continue to inform the user of the answer stored for
the prompt.  Note that similar messages are displayed for environmental
indicator prompts and this change applies to them. The associated remedy
tickets are 11393 and 113931.
 
4.  For CPRS prescription orders finished using the Complete Orders from
OERR option [PSO LMOE FINISH] or the Patient Prescription Processing
option [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS], a copay related message was displayed for
SC&gt;50% patients, supply items and investigational drugs.  The following is
an example, and please note that bracketed information can be either COPAY
or NO COPAY depending on the providers response to the clinical indicator.
 
     Do you want to enter a Progress Note? No//   NO
 
            SC Percent: 40%
            Disabilities: NONE STATED
 
     This Rx has been flagged by the provider as: [NO COPAY]
 
     Was treatment for Service Connected condition? YES
 
The "This Rx has been flagged by the provider as: [COPAY/NO COPAY]"
message will no longer be displayed for SC&gt;50% patients, supply items, 
and investigational drugs.  There is no associated remedy ticket.
 
5.  When an edit that creates a new order is performed in Outpatient 
Pharmacy, a message is displayed to notate that the orderable item was
changed.  This message is displayed in the Complete Orders from OERR
[PSO LMOE FINISH] option and the Patient Prescription Processing option
[PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]. The following is an example:
 
      CARBAMAZEPINE 100MG TAB
      PROVIDER,NAME           PROVIDER,NAME
      # of Refills: 3
 
      The Pharmacy Orderable Item has changed for this order. Please
      review any existing medication copay exemption defaults carefully
      for appropriateness.
 
      SC Percent: 40%
      Disabilities: NONE STATED
 
      Was treatment for Service Connected condition? YES// 
 
The above message has been modified to the following:
 
      The Pharmacy Orderable Item has changed for this order. Please
      review any existing SC or Environmental Indicator defaults carefully
      for appropriateness.
 
Technical Description:
----------------------
The following correlates to each sequence in the Functional Description 
above and the routines modified are shown in parentheses by each function:
 
1.  The SCNEW^PSOCP API was returning PSOTG("SC")="" variable for NSC
patients which caused CPRS to erroneously prompt for them.  Also due to
this, Mailman messages for "RX COPAY STATUS REVIEW NEEDED" information was
sent in error for NSC prescriptions at release of the prescription. These
issues were corrected, and the PSOCPE routine was modified to show the
patient's eligibilities and disabilities as well as impart more accurate
information.
 
 2.  Modified renewal routines to always pull SC/EI information from the
data passed on the renewed order from CPRS (PSORENW1, PSORN52, PSORN52D).
This change affects renewals from CPRS and backdoor Outpatient Pharmacy
orders.
 
3.  For SC&gt;50% prescriptions, supply items and investigational drugs,
eliminated the display of "Please use the 'Reset Copay Status/Cancel
Charges' option to make corrections." sentence (PSOCPB, PSOMLLD2,
PSOMLLDT), but it will continue to be displayed for SC&lt;50% prescriptions.
 
4.  For SC&gt;50% prescriptions, supply items and investigational drugs,
eliminated the display of "This Rx has been flagged by the provider as:
[COPAY/NO COPAY]" (PSOCPB, PSONEWF, PSORN52).  This message will continue
to be displayed for SC&lt;50% patients.
 
5.  For SC 0-100%, supply items and investigational drugs, modified the 
wording of the message displayed when a prescription edit that creates a 
new order is performed (PSOCPB, PSONEWF, PSONEWG).

This patch will create and populate a new NCPDP NUMBER field (#1008) in
the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59). This field is needed for the Remote Data
Interoperability Department of Defense (DoD) Clinical/Health Data 
Repository (CHDR) application.
 
NCPDP stands for the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs
formerly referred to as the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy
Number (NABP). The numbers being used to populate the field come from a
spreadsheet provided for this project dated 2/11/05.
 
The PSO SITE INPUT TEMPLATE is changed to include the new field. Through
the PSO SITE PARAMETERS [Site Parameter Enter/Edit] option, the user can
add, edit, or delete the NCPDP assigned licensed pharmacy number.
 
When the patch is installed, a post-install job will be queued to
populate the NCPDP number and a MailMan message will be sent indicating
the NCPDP numbers for each active division and site. If there is already
a value in the NCPDP number field, this patch will not overwrite it.

direct M-based global reads or writes to these files must be replaced by 
calling the APIs provided in this patch. When the new data source is in 
place, the calling applications will not be required to make any changes, 
because these APIs will be flexible enough to retrieve the requested data 
from the new data source, when the time comes.
 
These are the files that are affected. If any application is making 
direct global reads or writes to any of these files, they must be 
replaced by using the APIs exported with this patch.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch adds the capability of doing order checking between local VA 
facilities and remote VA or Department of Defense (DoD) facilities where 
veterans have received prescriptions. This Remote Data Interoperability 
(RDI) functionality includes receiving data from the Health Data
Repository (HDR) in order to perform the order checking against remote
data.
 
After the release of this patch, a Computerized Patient Record System
(CPRS) patch will turn on a flag which enables the remote order checking
to occur. When turned on, the remote order checking includes checks for
duplicate drugs, duplicate drug classes, drug interactions, and drug
allergies.
 
In addition to the new functionality, there are several help desk tickets
related to erroneous drug interactions with non-VA meds. The problem
and fix have been identified as a variable being carried over from prior 
drug checks that should have been killed in between. Because the routine
that needs to be fixed is already being changed as part of the RDI
project, the change to kill the variable at the end of the interaction 
checking will be included in this RDI patch.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This is the second follow up patch for Outpatient Pharmacy Clinical
Indicator Data Capture (CIDC) patch PSO*7*143.  The first follow-up patch
was PSO*7*219, and the follow-up patches were split into two patches in
order to quickly get the issues resolved by patch PSO*7*219 into the field
immediately.
 
Functional Description:
=======================
This patch PSO*7*226 corrects the following:
 
1.  For only edited prescriptions ordered prior to patch PSO*7*143 being 
installed, the routine that passes information from Outpatient Pharmacy to
CPRS was passing an extra value and was not passing the Combat Veteran
indicator.  An edit to days supply, quantity, etc. on a prescription 
results in a background transmission of data to CRPS.  This type of data
was passed and updated in CRPS correctly.  Because CPRS does not 
currently update SC/EI's for edited prescriptions, there were no adverse
affects.  However, Outpatient Pharmacy sends all data for consistency, and
this was corrected.  There are no associated remedy tickets for this
change.
 
2.  A dollar sign ($) was being displayed for exempt from copay
prescriptions, and it was being displayed up until the prescription was
released.  Also, 'COPAY' was being printed on the label for this type 
of prescription.
 
3.  Copays were erroneously being charged for non-service connected (NSC)
prescriptions fills that had an environmental indicator flagged as
"Yes".   And, copays were charged for some service connected (SC) &lt;50%
prescriptions, and this was due to a "RX COPAY STATUS REVIEW NEEDED"
Mailman message being sent instead of prompting the user for the SC/EI
information.  Patch PSO*7*219 corrected this issue, but PSO*7*226 cancels
the erroneously billed copay(s) as well as restores the copay related
fields in PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
 
When installing this patch, the 'copay correction' portion of this patch
is optional.  Each site can determine if they would be better suited to
run this automated process or correct them manually.  If you answer N (No)
to running the copay correction process and change your mind later, then
have your IRM run ^PSOCIDC1 from the programmers prompt.  Please keep in 
mind that by not running the copay correction process that those
prescriptions where the IBQ node was not stored correctly will continue to
generate a copay until the fill is copied or renewed.
 
 
Technical Description:
======================
The following correlates to each sequence in the Functional Description:
 
1.  In background processing, the PSOHLSN2 routine passes information from
Outpatient Pharmacy to CPRS when orders are created, edited, copied or
renewed from backdoor order entry.  Even though CPRS does not 
currently update SC/EI information for edited prescriptions, Outpatient
Pharmacy passes them for consistency.  The code that handles pre-CIDC
edited prescriptions passed an extra value and did not pass the Combat
Veteran indicator.  Because CPRS does not update SC/EI's for edited
prescriptions, there were no adverse affects.  A change was made to pass
the Combat Veteran indicator and not pass the extra value.
 
2.  Because a value denoting copay was allowed to remain in the COPAY 
TRANSACTION TYPE field (#105) for exempt from copay prescriptions, the
$ sign was incorrectly being displayed and "COPAY was being printed on 
the prescription label.  Modifications were made to eliminate the display
of the $ sign for exempt from copay fills which in turn eliminates the
printing of 'COPAY' on the label.  Also, modifications were made to
eliminate this value for NSC and SC&lt;50% prescriptions for all affected
fills finished between the installation date of patch PSO*7*143 until
present. This patch re-examines the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) for any NSC
and SC&lt;50% prescription that has an ICD node and does not have an IBQ
node.  Using the SC/EI answers stored on the ICD node, the IBQ node is
defined and the COPAY TRANSACTION TYPE field (#105) is defined
appropriately.
 
3.  For those prescriptions that were erroneously billed a copay from 
the installation of PSO*7*143 until present, this patch evaluates any
prescription that was billed, that has an ICD node, but does not have an
IBQ node.  Using the SC/EI answers stored on the ICD node, the IBQ node is
defined.  Then, if a yes answer is defined for any SC or EI, IB is
notified to cancel copay for the fill.
 
This patch prompts the user during installation when to run the copay
correction process.  The job name for this process is 'CANCEL COPAY'.  It
provides summary Mailman messages, and a detailed Results Report by
Veteran that can be run from Programmer mode.  Also, a Query Status of Job
function as well as a Stop Job Command function is provided.  See the
reports and samples section below for details and images of these
features.
 
 
Reports Section:
================
 
* See the sample section below for images of these features.
 
1.  The CANCEL COPAY process will produce a summary mail message of its 
findings and display instructions on how to print a detailed report by 
Veteran.  This MailMan message will be sent to all users that hold the 
'PSO COPAY' security key and the installer of the patch.  This message 
contains results by year and 30, 60, and 90 day fills for total 
released, total un-released, and total cancelled copays.
 
2.  A summary Mailman message will be sent to Management for their 
review.  It can be cut and pasted into a .TXT file.
 
3.  A detailed report by Veteran and fill number can be produced on 
demand by entering D RPT^PSOCIDC3 at the programmers prompt. 
 
4.  To check the status of the COPAY CANCEL background job while it is
running, then type from the direct programmers prompt the command 
D STATUS^PSOCIDC1.
 
5.  If you need to stop the COPAY CANCEL background job for any reason,
then from the direct programmers prompt, type the command D STOP^PSOCIDC1.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The Transitional Pharmacy Benefit (TPB) project that was providing
functionality to furnish medications prescribed by Non-VA Physicians
needs to be shut down as the period for its eligibility expired on
October 22, 2004.  Inactivation of the TPB functionality will be done in 2
steps, a manual step and a automatic step.
 
Step I-To make sure that the Health Level Seven (HL7) data transmission
      of TPB eligible patients to the Austin Automation Center (AAC) is
      shutdown.
Step II-The installation of this patch will automatically inactivate all
     the TPB functionality.

1. This patch disables the following menu options by placing them to
   be out of order:
      - TPB HL7 Data Extract/Transmission [PSO TPB HL7 EXTRACT]
      - TPB Institution Letter Enter/Edit [PSO TPB INSTITUTION LETTERS]
      - Report TPB Patients Letters Printed/NOT Printed

         [PSO TPB PATIENT RX REPORT]
      - Print TPB Patient Letter(s) [PSO TPB PRINT LETTERS]
      - TPB Rx (Prescription) Entry [PSO TPB RX ENTRY]
 
2. Inactivation of all active TPB patients
   This patch will scan all the entries in the TPB ELIGIBILITY file
   (#52.91) and will stuff the INACTIVATION OF BENEFIT DATE field (#2)
   of the active patients with today's date and the INACTIVATION REASON
   CODE field (#3) with the code "10-PROGRAM ENDED".
 
3. When a prescription is discontinued, routine PSOTPCAN is called to
   check if that's the last active TPB prescription for an Active TPB
   patient, and if so, the patient TPB patient is inactivated from TPB
   ELIGIBILITY file (#52.91). Based on the fact that there will be no
   active TPB patient upon installing of this patch, routine PSOTPCAN is
   modified to quit without checking for last active TPB prescription.
 
4. Prior to this patch, Outpatient Pharmacy software used to be notified
   by the Scheduling software every time a patient has an appointment at a
   VA clinic. If the patient is eligible for the TPB benefit, the
   appointment was at a clinic defined as primary care for the TPB program
   (determined through a set of clinic stop codes) AND the patient does
   not have any "active" TPB prescription(s) on file, this patient will
   have the TPB eligibility automatically inactivated (introduced by
   PSO*7*160). As all active TPB patient's will be inactivated (item #2
   above), there is no need for this functionality to continue. This patch
   will stop this functionality by removing the PSO TPB SD SUB protocol
   entry from the SDAM APPOINTMENT EVENTS Scheduling protocol.
 
5. This patch will set the AUTOSTART field (#4.5) of the HL LOGICAL LINK
   file (#870) of the PSOTPBAAC Logical Link to "Disabled", to prevent
   restarting of the PSOTPBAAC logical link by TaskMan after a system
   reboot.
 
6. The TPB data extraction job is queued to run daily and transmit
   data to the AAC every Sunday. This patch will remove the TPB HL7 Data
   Extract/Transmission [PSO TPB HL7 EXTRACT] option from the Task
   Manager.
 
Note:
     - The post install routine (PSO227PO) included in this patch
       addresses all items in step II except #3.
     - Most of the TPB routines that are transported in this patch are
       modified to "QUIT" if they are ever called by any other routine.

information to the HDR (Health Data Repository). This will help avoid 
errors that can occur when special delimiting characters are found in 
Vista fields.
 
This patch also makes modifications to the trigger events that send 
prescription information to the HDR, using the VDEF. A problem was
reported where the Clinical ID information was not being sent in some
messages. This patch fixes that problem.
 
A request has also been made add two new trigger events, those being when
the status of a prescription changes from Active to Suspended, and from
Suspended to Active. This patch add those trigger events.
 
The name of the Institution has also been added to the message.

The National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) standard was
adopted under the Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA) for pharmacy claims. The HIPAA NCPDP - GLOBAL project involves six
different applications that have been significantly changed to enable VA
Medical Centers to perform third party electronic billing for prescriptions
using the NCPDP standard. 
 
Below is a list of all the applications involved in this project along with
their patch number:

Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
software applications and infrastructure were enhanced, in order to allow the
electronic transmission of outpatient pharmacy prescription claims (WINDOW
and MAIL fills) to third party payers via the network connections available
through the Austin Automation Center (AAC). VistA will be enhanced to receive
electronic adjudicated responses from the third party payers, which include
real-time processing for Drug Review Utilization and Refill Too Soon rejects.
Reject information will be displayed to the pharmacist as the prescription is
being processed. The pharmacist will have the capability to take the
appropriate action to ensure patient safety or to override the reject and
resubmit the claim to the payer for payment. When a status of "PAYABLE" is
returned by the payer for a released prescription, VistA will automatically
create the bill in IB, authorize it and immediately create the receivable in
the AR application. Since the exact amount being paid by the payer is known,
a decrease adjustment will be automatically generated and applied so that the
receivable is equal to the net amount due from the payer.
 
The system also provides electronic payment matching capability (for
electronically billable outpatient pharmacy prescriptions) using the existing
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Lockbox functionality which processes other
electronic payments from third party payers. This real-time electronic claims
processing capability will be provided in accordance with the HIPAA, EDI
and the NCPDP mandated format standards, specifically NCPDP Telecommunication
Standard V. 5.1. Additional functionality delivered with this project 
includes:
 
   . Auto-Release/Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI) Integration.
   . Back-billing capability to allow electronic billing of claims from within
     the IB application.
   . Capability to MOVE a group of subscribers from one insurance plan to
     another while automatically "expiring" the old plan, which is a major
     time saver.
   . Pharmacy Dispensed As Written (DAW) prescription processing.
  
Overview of the Process:
  
When a prescription is about to be filled and dispensed by the pharmacy, the
OP application submits the prescription to the new ECME application. ECME then
contacts IB to verify whether or not the prescription is electronically
billable. If so, ECME gathers the information necessary to generate a NCPDP
claim. The claim information is passed to the VistA Health Level Seven (HL7)
package. The HL7 package then sends the billing information to the AAC, where
it is routed to the corresponding third party insurance via Emdeon (formerly
WebMD).
  
Once the payer processes the information, the response coming back from the
payer is passed back to the site that made the request, and the information
is stored in the ECME package. If the third party payer accepted the claim,
the adjudicated information is passed along to IB. If the claim was rejected
the problem can be worked on and a new claim can be submitted to the payer.
  
For electronically billable CMOP prescription processing, the third party
claim is sent before the prescription information is transmitted to the
CMOP facility to be filled. Once the adjudicating response is electronically
received from the third party payer, if there are no Drug Utilization Review
or Refill Too Soon rejects, the prescription is then transmitted to the CMOP
facility. When the CMOP center sends the dispensing information back to VistA,
the National Drug Code (NDC) information is checked against the NDC sent to
the third party payer and, if different, a new claim is generated in the
background and is sent to the third party payer. In case the CMOP facility
indicates that it is unable to fill a "PAYABLE" prescription fill, a reversal
is automatically submitted to the third party payer for the corresponding
fill.
 
This patch modifies the OP application to perform real-time electronic claim
submission to third party payers. It will also enable OP users to see and act
on third party payer rejects such as Drug Utilization Review (DUR) and Refill
Too Soon rejects along with their daily normal prescription processing 
activities. The following areas of OP have been changed:
  
1.  Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option 
 
    At the point that the prescription is verified, the New Order, Edit,
    Renew, Refill, and Pull Early from Suspense functions will begin the
    third party billing evaluations. If IB determines that the
    prescription is third party billable, a message will be displayed on
    the user's screen stating that the claim is being submitted to ECME
    and it will also show the progress of the claim. If the payer rejects
    the claim for DUR or Refill Too Soon, the payer's information will be
    displayed, and the user will be given the opportunity to either ignore
    the payer's response and move on with the filling process; override
    the reject by resubmitting the claim or postpone the processing of the
    prescription by taking no action when the reject is received. For
    prescriptions that have been electronically submitted to the third
    party payer, an indicator is displayed on the Patient Prescription
    Processing screen. This indicator will take the form of "e" next to
    the prescription number (e.g.,"2090303$e").  
  
    A new section called REFILL TOO SOON/DUR REJECTS (Third Party) has
    been created in the Medication Profile screen to single out
    prescription that had an electronic claim rejected by third party
    payers for REFILL TOO SOON or DUR reasons. Prescriptions under this
    section have certain restrictions. Basically, they cannot be renewed,
    refilled, reprinted, copied or released until the REJECT is resolved.
    When an individual prescription is selected, the user will have a new
    hidden option called REJ - View Reject, which will allow them to
    resolve the REJECT and remove it from the REFILL TOO SOON/DUR REJECTS
    (Third Party) section.
   
    The prescription release option was modified to perform NDC (National
    Drug Code) validation for electronically billable prescriptions. When
    the user selects a new NDC a new claim is submitted to the payer
    before the prescription is released.
   
    In the OP Medications screen, a new DAW CODE field (#81) of the 
    PRESCRIPTION file (#52) was created for electronically billable
    prescriptions and can be edited by selecting '21' at the 'Select
    Action' prompt. For non-electronically billable prescriptions this
    field is not displayed at all.
    
    When the electronically billable prescription is released, this option
    will allow the user to edit the NDC code for the prescription. In the
    OP Medications screen the NDC field is listed under the Drug field
    and can be edited by selecting '2' to edit the drug at the 'Select
    Action' prompt. For sites that do not allow Drug editing, the option
    '2' will allow editing of the NDC only.
 
2.  Return Medication to Stock [PSO RETURNED STOCK] option 
 
    The Return Medication to Stock function was modified to notify the
    third party payer that a previously billed prescription was not
    actually filled. If the prescription was previously billed to a third
    party payer and a payable response was received, the claim will be
    reversed, and the pharmacy user will see messaging stating that the
    third party claim was submitted for reversal. If a claim for the
    prescription was previously rejected by the third party payer, the
    user will see a message indicating that no reversal was required. If
    the prescription was not previously billed to a third party payer, no
    message regarding electronic billing will be displayed.
 
3.  Delete a Prescription [PSO RXDL] option 
 
    The message for Delete a Prescription was modified to perform in the 
    same manner as the Return Medication to Stock function described
    above.
  
4.  Pull Early from Suspense [PSO PNDRX] option 
  
    The Pull Early from Suspense function was modified to submit a third 
    party claim for the prescription. A message will display to notify the
    user of the status of the claim as it is going through the submission 
    process.  
 
5.  Print from Suspense File [PSO PNDLBL] option 
 
    This option was modified to submit third party claims in the same
    manner as stated above except the Print from Suspense File function
    will be performed in the background. No user interaction will occur.
  
6.  ePharmacy Menu [PSO EPHARMACY MENU] menu
 
    This new menu was created for electronic billing related options. It
    is being placed under the Rx (Prescriptions) [PSO RX] menu. Two new
    options are being added under this new menu:
 
    6.1 Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] option
 
        This option is used to process third party payer rejects that have
        clinical significance. For now, only DUR (Drug Utilization Review)
        and REFILL TOO SOON rejects are being considered as having
        clinical significance.
 
    6.2 Third Party Payer Rejects - View/Process [PSO REJECTS 
        VIEW/PROCESS] option
 
        This option performs the same functionality as the option above.
        However, the user has more filtering capabilities through this
        option. In addition, closed/resolved rejects can only be viewed by
        using this option.
          
7.  Release Medication [PSO RELEASE] option 
 
    The prescription release process was modified to perform NDC (National
    Drug Code) validation for electronically billable prescriptions. When
    the user selects a new NDC, a new claim is submitted to the payer
    before the prescription is released. Besides this option, the 
    prescription can be released from the Medication Profile screen and
    from the Outpatient Rx's [PSD OUTPATIENT] option in the Controlled
    Substances application.
   
8.  View Prescriptions [PSO VIEW] option
  
    This option was changed to include two new sections: ECME Log and ECME
    REJECT Log. Information about third party payer submission and rejects
    will be displayed under these sections.
    
9.  Edit Prescriptions [PSO RXEDIT] option
 
    The new DAW CODE field (#81) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) was
    created for electronically billable prescriptions and can be edited
    through this option. For non-electronically billable prescriptions,
    the field is not displayed at all.
    
    Once an electronically billable prescription is released, this option
    will allow the user to edit the NDC code. The NDC code is displayed on
    the screen just below the Drug field, and can be edited by selecting
    field '2' to edit the Drug. For sites that do not allow Drug editing,
    the field '2' can be used to edit the NDC code only.
 
10. The NDC field (#4) under the CMOP EVENT multiple (#52.01) of the
    PRESCRIPTION file (#52) has been renamed to NDC RECEIVED. This field
    holds the NDC that was received from the CMOP facility with the
    dispensing message. The renaming was necessary due to the addition of 
    the NDC SENT field (#12) under the same multiple that is being created
    by this project (see below item 11).
  
11. A new NDC SENT field (#12) is being created under the CMOP EVENT 
    multiple (#52.01) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52), to store the NDC
    that was transmission to CMOP. This field is used for electronic 
    billing purposes to analyze the difference between the NDC sent to
    CMOP and the actual dispensed NDC by the CMOP facility.
 
12. A new DAW CODE field (#81) is being created on the PRESCRIPTION
    file (#52) and also under the REFILL multiple (#52.1) of the
    PRESCRIPTION file (#52). This field contains the NCPDP DAW used in the
    electronic claims submission to third party payers (insurance
    companies).
 
13. A new RE-TRANSMIT FLAG field (#82) is being created on the 
    PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and also under the REFILL multiple (#52.1) of 
    the PRESCRIPTION file (#52). This field is used to indicate that a
    claim should be electronically re-transmitted to the 3rd party payer
    (insurance company). It will be primarily used by CMOP and local mail
    prescriptions.
   
14. A new multiple REJECT INFO field (#52.25) has been created on the
    PRESCRIPTION file (#52) to store information about DUR and Refill Too
    Soon Rejects returned by 3rd party payers. 
    The following fields are part of this multiple:
 
        .01   NCPDP REJECT CODE      
          1   DATE/TIME DETECTED     
          2   PAYER MESSAGE          
          3   REASON                 
          4   PHARMACIST             
          5   FILL NUMBER            
          6   GROUP NAME             
          7   PLAN CONTACT           
          8   PLAN PREVIOUS FILL DATE
          9   STATUS   
         10   CLOSED DATE/TIME 
         11   CLOSED BY
         12   CLOSE REASON
         13   CLOSE COMMENTS
         14   REASON FOR SERVICE CODE
         15   PROFESSIONAL SERVICE CODE
         16   RESPONSE ID
         17   OTHER REJECTS     
         18   DUR TEXT          
         19   RESULT OF SERVICE CODE
         20   INSURANCE NAME    
         21   GROUP NUMBER      
         22   CARDHOLDER ID 
         23   RE-OPENED
 
    Two new cross-references named "REJDAT" and "REJSTS" were created for
    this multiple in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52). The "REJDAT" uses the
    DATE/TIME DETECTED field (#1) and the "REJSTS" uses the STATUS field
    (#9).

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;149 SEQ #212</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2006-07-11 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The Registration application has released enhancements designed to
provide a more accurate and cleaner update of the patient address. One
of the things included in the enhancements is the automatic population
of city, state, and county based on entry of a zip code. For more
detailed information about this and the other enhancements recently 
released by the Registration application, please refer to the patch 
description of DG*5.3*522.
  
This patch is responsible for updating Outpatient Pharmacy with the new
functionality made available by the Registration application. More
specifically, the update of the patient permanent address through the
Outpatient Pharmacy application will be enhanced with the new 
functionality that was recently released by the Registration application
with the patch DG*5.3*522.
 
For sites that have patch IVM*2*108 installed, the address history will
captured in the IVM ADDRESS UPDATE LOG File (#301.7).
 
Two places in the Outpatient Pharmacy application will be affected by
this change:
 
 1) Menu option: Update Patient Record    [PSO PAT]
 2) Patient Information screen, option PU - Patient Record Update
 
 Note: The Patient Information screen can be reached through the menu 
       options Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
       and Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH].
 
The examples below show how the patient permanent address edit was before
and how it is going to be changed after this patch is installed:

    - A new prompt "Do you want to update the Permanent address/phone?
      //N" will be displayed before editing the permanent address/phone
      information to give the user a chance to skip it. If the user
      responds with "N", the control will go to the CNH CURRENT field
      prompt. Otherwise, the user will go through editing the
      address/phone information fields.
 
    - When entering a new or updating an existing patient permanent
      address, the information is not saved to the database until the
      prompt above "Are you sure that you want to save the above changes?"
      is answered YES. If the application times out or an '^' (up-arrow)
      is entered in any of the permanent address fields above, the changes
      are NOT saved.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch supports the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) 
standard which was adopted under the Healthcare Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) for pharmacy claims. This patch is one of six to be
released.  Three patches will be released in a KIDS multi-build distribution 
containing: BPS*1*3, PSO*7*247, and IB*2*342.  Three patches will be released
individually and they are: PRCA*4.5*247, PSX*2*62, and PSS*1*115.  There is no 
recommended order to installing the stand-alone patches and they can be 
installed independently of the multi-build as there is no dependency between 
the multi-build distribution and the stand-alone patches.  For more specific 
instructions please refer to the installation steps provided in each of the 
stand-alone patches.
 
Enhancements included in the release of the six patches are a new option that 
will enable the user to reopen a closed Electronic Claims Management Engine
(ECME) claim; updates to the Rx Activity Log; and permanent storage of Claims
activity information as reported by the ECME Billing Events Report.   
    
This patch modifies the Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) V. 7.0 application in the
following areas: 
 
1. When the DAW CODE was edited on a released Consolidated Mail Outpatient 
   Pharmacy (CMOP)  prescription it was not triggering an automatic claim 
   reversal/re-submit to the third party payer. This patch corrects the 
   problem. Editing the DAW CODE on a released CMOP prescription will work
   similar to editing a WINDOW prescription, it will reverse/re-submit a
   claim.
 
2. The ECME Reject section of the prescription activity log was changed in
   the following ways: 
   
   2.1) The column header "Date/Time" was changed to "Date/Time Rcvd" because
        a new column is being created (see 2.3).
   2.2) "DRUG UTILIZATION REVIEW" in the "Reject" column will now display as
        "DUR" for space saving purposes.
   2.3) A new column is being created called "Date/Time Resolved" on the
        right hand side to display the Date/Time the reject was resolved.
 
3. The option Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST]
   is being changed to allow the user to print a label for window
   prescriptions after a reject is resolved. The label print prompt will only
   be available if the prescription is active and no label was printed for
   the fill which reject was resolved. The following prompts will be 
   presented to the user:
 
      Print Label? YES // YES
    
      Select LABEL DEVICE:
 
4. When the user resolved a third party reject using the 'Override Reject'
   action from the Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS 
   WORKLIST] option, the entry in the Prescription activity log 
   corresponding to this event was not displaying the NCPDP override codes
   entered by the user. Before this fix the comment displayed as 
   'Submitted to ECME:REJECT WORKLIST-E PAYABLE'. After this patch is
   installed the comment will be logged as 'Submitted to ECME:REJECT 
   WORKLIST-DUR OVERRIDE CODES(NN/AS/1B)-E PAYABLE', as an example.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The Department of Veterans Affairs National Clozapine Coordinating Center
(NCCC), is requesting modifications to Veterans Health Information Systems
and Technology Architecture (VistA) Outpatient Pharmacy and Mental Health
applications to meet revisions in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
monitoring requirements for blood monitoring in patients being treated
with Clozapine.
 
This patch PSO*7*222 is associated with the MENTAL HEALTH V. 5.01 patch
YS*5.01*90 and patch YS*5.01*90 is a required patch for PSO*7*222. Please
read the patch description of YS*5.01*90 for complete details of this new
enhancement.
 
This Outpatient Pharmacy patch PSO*7*222 contains the following
must-do-work enhancements for Clozapine dispensing:
 
1. Adjust the business rules to disallow prescription processing without
   override if 3500/mm3&gt;WBC&gt;3000/mm3 and 2000/mm3&gt;ANC&gt;1500/mm3.
   These levels require twice weekly blood testing until the WBC
   stabilizes above 3500/mm3 and ANC above 2000/mm3 with no signs of
   infection.
2. Modify routine logic to recognize the new monthly status and apply the
   appropriate restrictions for lab draw checks.
3. Add a new field to the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) to store ANC value and
   modify routine logic to require both a WBC and ANC be drawn and
   reported before drug dispensing is allowed.
4. Modify routine logic to prevent local users from editing the Patient
   Status within Clozapine module.
 
This patch transports the following fields:
1. The field length of the WBC RESULT field (#302) of the PRESCRIPTION
   file (#52) is modified from 3 to 5 digits to accommodate values up to
   99999 as these values will be stored in 1000s.
2. A new field ANC RESULTS field (#304) is added to the PRESCRIPTION file
   (#52) to store the ANC test value.
3. The field name of REASON FOR LOCKOUT field (#4) of the CLOZAPINE
   PRESCRIPTION OVERRIDES file (#52.52) is changed to REASON FOR OVERRIDE.
   The set of codes have been modified and three new codes were added. The
   modified Data Dictionary (DD) is as follows:
 
   52.52,4       REASON FOR OVERRIDE    0;5 SET (Required)
                        '1' FOR NO WBC IN LAST 7 DAYS;
                        '2' FOR NO VERIFIED WBC;
                        '3' FOR LAST WBC RESULT &lt; 3500;
                        '4' FOR 3 SEQ. WBC DECREASE;
                        '5' FOR LAST ANC RESULT &lt; 2000;
                        '6' FOR 3 SEQ. ANC DECREASE ;
                        '7' FOR NCCC AUTHORIZED;
 
 
The Outpatient Pharmacy patch PSO*7*227, TRANSITIONAL PHARMACY BENEFIT
(TPB) inactivation, was placing the TPB HL7 Data Extract/Transmission [PSO
TPB HL7 EXTRACT] option out of order. Sites testing patch PSO*7*227
recommended that we remove this task totally from the OPTION SCHEDULING
file (#19.2). Therefore, a post-install routine (PSOP222) is included in
this patch PSO*7*222 to delete the TPB HL7 Data Extract/Transmission [PSO
TPB HL7 EXTRACT] option from the OPTION SCHEDULING file (#19.2).
The post-install routine will also provide the following changes:
1. As the patch PSO*7*227 inactivated the TPB functionality, the security
   access codes for the TPB ELIGIBILITY file (#52.91) still remains open.
   These codes will be changed to "@" sign restricting access to
   programmers only.
2. The read access code of the PRESCRIPTION REFILL REQUEST file (#52.43)
   is currently set to "@" sign (programmer access). As per the
   Electronic, Error and Enhancement Report (E3R) 19725 request, this will
   be changed to "Pp" (Pharmacy Package) access.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch enhances the usage of Application Program Interfaces (APIs) to
the Registration Package V. 5.3 to check the setting of the BAD ADDRESS
INDICATOR field (#.121) in the PATIENT file (#2) and to update the
permanent and temporary addresses. The BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR (referred to
as BAI in this description) is one of the fields presented when using the
API to update permanent address fields.
 
Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 options are modified to not print the 
patient's address if a bad address is indicated and to prompt to update
the patient's address when appropriate. If the patient has the BAD ADDRESS
INDICATOR field set and no active temporary address, this is referred to
as a BAI condition in this description.
 
Note: Related changes for the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface
(OPAI) and Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) will be done in
patches PSO*7*200 and PSX*2*54.
 
 
The following changes are made in this patch:
 
1. A new security key PSO ADDRESS UPDATE is added. Either the EDIT 
PATIENT DATA field (#.123) in the PSO SITE file (#59) must be set to 
"Yes" or the user must have this new security key in order to be
prompted to update the address (permanent and/or temporary addresses).
 
2. When selecting a patient name in the Patient Prescription Processing 
[PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, if the patient's address is flagged with
a Bad Address Indicator, then a warning message is displayed. If the 
EDIT PATIENT DATA is set to Yes or the user holds the new
PSO ADDRESS UPDATE security key, he will be asked if he wants to update
the patient's address. If there is a valid temporary address, a message to
that effect is displayed before the prompt to update the address.
 
Example:
  PSOOUTPATIENT,ONE (000-00-0777)
 
        WARNING: The patient address is indicated as a bad
                 address (UNDELIVERABLE).
                 * Temporary address is active *
Do you want to update the address/phone? N// YES
Update (P)ermanent address, (T)emporary, or (B)oth: BOTH// 
 
3. In the Medication Profile [PSO P] option, the Patient Prescription 
Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, and the Complete Orders from
OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option, the following changes were made:
a. When the medication profile is displayed, the letter "B" (for bad
address) is added to the status column if the last label activity for that
prescription indicated a BAI condition. If the address is corrected and
label reprinted, "B" no longer appears on the profile.
 
Example:
 
                    Medication Profile Sorted by ISSUE DATE

b. If there is no ending date for the temporary address, the fact that the
address was temporary was not being displayed in the patient profile.
This patch adds the temporary indication including the text "(no end
date)" if no ending temporary date exists.
 
Example:
 
Disabilities:

4. The Input Template [PSO OUTPT] is modified to remove temporary
address update prompts. Instead, a new API to the Registration Package 
V. 5.3 is used for updating temporary address for the Update Patient
Record [PSO PAT] option and the Patient Record Update [PU] action (within
the patient profile). This option and action are also changed to check for
the user holding the PSO ADDRESS UPDATE security key or the EDIT PATIENT
DATA field is set to "Yes" before the user is prompted to update the
addresses.
 
5. The following changes are made to laser label printing:
a. If BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR is set and there is no active temporary
address, the Mailing label prints ** BAD ADDRESS INDICATED ** and does not
print the rest of the mailing address.
b. An additional label log entry added for bad address indicated at the
time the label printed.
 
6. In the Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option, after the 
prompt to display the medication profile and after the patient name and 
social security number are shown, if the patient's address is flagged 
with a Bad Address Indicator, a warning message is displayed. If the 
temporary address is active, that information is displayed. The user
will not be prompted to update the address.
 
Example:
Do you want to see Medication Profile? Yes// NO
 
          PERPATNM,FRED (666-00-0777)
 
        WARNING: The patient address is indicated as a bad
                 address (UNDELIVERABLE).
                 * Temporary address is active *
 
Press Return to continue: 
 
7. The Action Profile (132 COLUMN PRINTOUT) [PSO ACTION PROFILE] option 
is modified to display **BAD ADDRESS INDICATED-(REASON)" where REASON is 
UNDELIVERABLE, HOMELESS, or OTHER.
 
8. Although the Transitional Pharmacy Benefits (TPB) options have been 
disabled, to keep the changes consistent, the routine to print TPB letters
is modified to look at the BAI condition and print "** BAD ADDRESS
INDICATED ** if applicable.
 
9.The Patient Address Changes Report [PSO ADDRESS CHANGE REPORT] option 
is modified to display additional mailing address-related fields from the
PATIENT file (#2) and some fields related to the mail setting from the
PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55). The user should use FileMan to turn 
on auditing for the following fields in order for them to be displayed 
in this report. (Fields added to this report by this patch are indicated
with a "*" in front of the field name).
 
a. For the PATIENT file (#2), turn on auditing for:
 
STREET ADDRESS [LINE 1] field (#.111)
ZIP+4 field (#.1112)
STREET ADDRESS [LINE 2] field (#.112)
STREET ADDRESS [LINE 3] field (#.113)
CITY field (#.114)
STATE field (#.115)
ZIP CODE field (#.116)
* BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR field (#.121)
* TEMPORARY ADDRESS ACTIVE? field (#.12105)
TEMPORARY STREET [LINE 1] field (#.1211)
TEMPORARY ZIP+4 field (#.12112)
TEMPORARY STREET [LINE 2] field (#.1212)
TEMPORARY STREET [LINE 3] field (#.1213)
TEMPORARY CITY field (#.1214)
TEMPORARY STATE field (#.1215)
TEMPORARY ZIP CODE field (#.1216)
* TEMPORARY ADDRESS START DATE field (#.1217)
* TEMPORARY ADDRESS END DATE field (#.1218)
 
b. For the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55), turn on auditing for:
* MAIL field (#.03)
* MAIL STATUS EXPIRATION DATE field (#.05)
 
10. By request of a pharmacy workgroup, two new codes were added to the
PRESCRIPTION file (#52) HOLD REASON field (#99):
                                '7' FOR BAD ADDRESS; 
                                '8' FOR PER PATIENT REQUEST; 
 
 
11. A Bad Address Reporting Main Menu [PSO BAI REPORT] option is added 
under the Output Reports [PSO OUTPUTS] option which includes the
following:
a. Bad Address Suspended List [PSO BAI SUSPENDED] option
This option identifies prescriptions for veterans with a BAI Condition
giving the opportunity to be proactive regarding prescriptions that when
Printed or Pulled Early from Suspense, would be unable to be mailed.
 
b. List Prescriptions Not Mailed [PSO BAI NOT MAILED] option  
This option provides a report of prescriptions with a routing of Mail that
were not mailed due to a bad address. This is based on the last label
activity entry being flagged as a bad address and a route other than
"WINDOW". If the address is corrected and a label reprinted, this
prescription would no longer show on the report.
 
12. The View Prescriptions [PSO VIEW] option is changed to show Bad 
Address Indicated if BAI flag is set and no active temporary address. 
Example:
VIEW PRESCRIPTION:    713449A     ACETAMINOPHEN 325MG TAB

<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2006-11-22 22:31:31</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The following describes all of the changes included in this patch:
 
1.  For Remedy Ticket 130112:
 
After installation of patch PSO*7*226, it was reported that the activity
log entries generated by the patch were confusing. A large part of patch
PSO*7*226 was to cancel any erroneously billed copays and to define any
missing IBQ nodes on the prescription using the SC/EI answers stored on
the ICD node.  For those prescriptions where the IBQ node was defined, an
activity log entry was created with a reason of "RETURNED".  For those
prescriptions where copay was cancelled, a copay activity log was
generated. The following are examples of those types of entries made by
PSO*7*226.
 
Activity Log Example:
 
  1   11/28/05    X-INTERFACE    ORIGINAL       PHARMACIST,ONE
    Comments: Prescription sent to external interface.
  2   11/28/05    RETURNED       ORIGINAL       POSTMASTER
    Comments:  BKGD CIDC UPDATE
  3   11/29/05    X-INTERFACE    REFILL 1       PHARMACIST,TWO
    Comments: Prescription sent to external interface.
 
Copay Activity Log Example:
 
  1   02/01/06    COPAY RESET          ORIGINAL       PHARMACIST,ONE
    Comment:-BKGD CIDC COPAY CANCEL  Old value=Copay   New value=No Copay
  2   02/01/06    REMOVE COPAY CHARGE  ORIGINAL       PHARMACIST,ONE
    Comment: RX EDITED -BKGD CIDC COPAY CANCEL
 
To eliminate any confusion, patch PSO*7*239 provides an Activity Log 
Correction process/Clean-up routine.  This routine will take the activity
log entries created by patch PSO*7*226, move them to the copay activity
log, and then subsequently will delete the activity log entries.  Also,
the comment on the copay activity log entries where copay was cancelled as
well as those entries moved to the copay activity log will be changed to
"CIDC CLEANUP".  The activity log will be resequenced to eliminate any
missing nodes, and the copay activity log will be resequenced to insert
the new entries by date and time.  The following are examples of the
updated entries:
 
  -Note that sequence two from the above example was removed and the
   third sequence was moved up.
 
  1   11/28/05    X-INTERFACE    ORIGINAL       PHARMACIST,ONE
    Comments: Prescription sent to external interface.
  2   11/28/05    X-INTERFACE    REFILL 1       PHARMACIST,TWO
    Comments: Prescription sent to external interface.
 
  -The next entry shows an Activity log entry moved to Copay Activity log:
 
  1   11/28/05    COPAY RESET       ORIGINAL         POSTMASTER
    Comment: CIDC CLEANUP
 
  -The following shows a cancelled Copay Activity Log entry comment
  updated to "CIDC CLEANUP:
 
  1   02/01/06    COPAY RESET          ORIGINAL       POSTMASTER
    Comment: CIDC CLEANUP  Old value=Copay   New value=No Copay
  2   02/01/06    REMOVE COPAY CHARGE  ORIGINAL       POSTMASTER
    Comment: CIDC CLEANUP  
 
This patch provides a listing of all prescriptions where the activity log
was updated by the Clean-up routine, a means of checking the status of the
Clean-up routine, and a means of stopping the Clean-up job if needed.  A
detailed description of these functions is located in the Technical
description.
 
When installing this patch, the activity log Clean-up portion of this
patch is optional.  However, it is highly recommended that it be run for 
consistency and maintainability.
 
Once the Clean-up routine has completed a mailman message will be sent to 
the user who installed the patch.  The following is an example:

    The CIDC ACTIVITY LOGS CORRECTION job for the Outpatient Pharmacy
    patch (PSO*7*239) started MAR 06, 2006@13:56:04
    and completed MAR 06, 2006@13:56:04.
 
    Enter message action (in IN basket): Ignore//
 
2. The following issues were found during unit testing for backdoor 
Outpatient Pharmacy orders, and the corrections are included in this
patch. 
 
A.  When a prescriptions with an exempt patient status is renewed and the
user changes the value of service connected (SC), the default value was
stored instead of the changed value.  This only occurred for the SC
prompt.  The renew process has been modified to store the changed value.
 
B.  When prescription information was stored when the RX Patient Status 
was exempt from copay, the IBQ node was being stored needlessly.  This
patch will remove the functionality that stored this node.
                                           
C.  For a patient defined as SC&lt;50 but had a null SC percentage value 
defined, backdoor Outpatient Pharmacy was asking the SC prompt but not
storing the answers. The SC prompt is only displayed for those
prescriptions that the Scheduling DBIA #1579 and/or the Integrated 
Billing (IB) DBIA #125 determines that it should be asked.  Upon release
of the fill, a "PRESCRIPTION QUESTIONS REVIEW NEEDED" mailman message
requesting entry of the SC field was sent to holders of the PSO COPAY
key.  Because this functionality uses the same checking mechanism as
non-exempt new orders, the following functions were affected by this
change:  copies, renews and edits that create a new order. This patch will
store the SC answer for null SC percentage values.
 
D.  The SC prompt was not asked in Computerized Patient Record System 
(CPRS), but was asked in backdoor Outpatient Pharmacy. No default answer
was shown in backdoor due to the question not being asked in CRPS.  This
occurred for any SC percentage that the SDCO22 API (#1579) returned a
value that indicated to not ask the SC question but IB returned a flag
that indicated that the SC question should be asked.  This problem occurs
for a variety of SC percentages based on how the patient's eligibility is
defined in enrollment.  This patch will tell CPRS to ask SC for this
scenario.
 
E.  It was found that edits made to SC and/or EI's during COMPLETE ORDERS
FROM OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option and the finish function in the PATIENT
PRESCRIPTION PROCESSING [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option were not reflected
in CPRS.  With the CIDC patches, a new standardized segment was created to
pass SC, EI's and ICD-9 diagnosis codes and use of the old segment was
discontinued. When the CPRS CIDC switch is off, CPRS is looking at the old
segment for updated orders. This patch adds the functionality to send both
ZSC and ZCL segments.
 
F.  When using the edit function in the PATIENT PRESCRIPTION PROCESSING
option [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS], the total number of entries in the ICD
DIAGNOSIS multiple (#52311) was being defined as one number less than it
should have been.  For example, eight diagnosis codes entered but the 
multiple shows seven as the total number of entries for the multiple.  The
diagnosis codes were displayed correctly to the user.  This patch will
store the correct number of entries when edits are performed.
 
G.  The PSOHLNE3 API IA (#4666) was defining an activity log entry that 
stated "Clinical Indicators and SC/EI's were updated from a CPRS e-sig 
edit..." for all prescriptions passed through the API.  Also, it was 
needlessly defining a copay activity log entry for supply items and
investigational drugs.   Last, it was storing a copay activity log entry
(copay to no copay) that was set erroneously when the provider edits
SC/EI's during sign of a verbal/telephone order leaving the prescription
as no copay.  This API is used to pass data from CPRS to OP when a verbal
or telephone order is signed in CPRS when the CPRS CIDC Switch is on.  
This patch limits the setting of the activity log to only those
prescriptions where SC, EI's and/or ICD's were changed during sign order.
And, it eliminates setting the copay activity log for supply items and
investigational drugs as well as eliminating the erroneous "copay to no 
copay" activity log entry.
 
H.  The RESET COPAY STATUS/CANCEL CHARGES option [PSOCP RESET COPAY 
STATUS] was overlaying the previously stored diagnosis code when storing
updated information.  Also, the default answer for SC was not being
displayed for SC&lt;50% patients.  This patch corrects these issues.
 
I.  When the CPRS CIDC switch is turned on, the B cross reference was 
not being defined in the ICD DIAGNOSIS field (#311) in PENDING OUTPATIENT
ORDERS file (#52.41).  For telephone/verbal orders signed in CPRS and 
CPRS renewals, the B cross reference was not being defined in the ICD
DIAGNOSIS field (#52311) in PRESCRIPTION file (#52).  This was not
reported as an issue, but the correction is being made in this patch.
 
 
Technical Descriptions:
=======================
1.  For Remedy Ticket 130112:
 
A.  A snapshot of the ACTIVITY LOG sub-file (#40) and the COPAY 
ACTIVITY LOG sub-file (#107) will be stored in ^XTMP("PSOCIDC7") node,
and will be available for 90 days.
 
B.  The "BKGD CIDC UPDATE" activity log entry will be removed and the 
ACTIVITY LOG sub-file (#40) will be re-subscripted to eliminate the
missing node. The removed entry will be inserted in the COPAY ACTIVITY LOG
sub-file (#107).  The date given in the old activity log entry will be
used as the COPAY ACTIVITY LOG field (#.01) for the new entry. The copay
activity log will be sorted by dates within the existing entries and
including the new entry, then they will be stored back into the COPAY
ACTIVITY LOG sub-file (#107). The comment for the new copay activity log
entry as well as any existing copay activity log entries will be changed
to state "CIDC CLEANUP" instead of "BKGD CIDC UPDATE".
 
C.  Because the copay to no copay or vice versa information was not 
recorded in the old Activity log entry, those values can only reflect the 
current state of the prescription, and it's thought that they should not
be stored on the new entry.
 
D.  To print the report of all prescriptions updated by the Clean-up 
routine, type the following from the programmer's prompt using the print 
device that you prefer.
 
     &gt;D RPT^PSOCIDC9
      DEVICE: HOME//     UCX/TELNET     RIGHT MARGIN:80//
 
    Patch PSO*7*239 - Corrected Activity and Copay Activity logs
 
     Note that this report reflects all prescriptions where the activity
     and/or copay activity logs were corrected. For detailed information,
     please view the activity and copay activity log on the prescription.
 
     Date printed: MAR 6,2006@14:09:25                       Page: 1

     BPATIENT,TWO     (B0033)  TROY, NY        200050
 
E.  The following is an example of a status query for the Clean-up 
routine, and it must be run from programmer's mode:
 
     &gt;D STATUS^PSOCIDC7
    
      Currently processing:
            Date being processed &gt; Nov 3, 2005
                            RX # &gt; 1375666
 
F.  A stop function has been provided in case the system needs to be
shut down for an emergency or other reason.  Then when the system is back
up and you are ready you may restart the job, it will resume where it
left off.  You may restart by entering D ^PSOCIDC7 at the programmer's
prompt.  The following is an example:
 
     &gt;D STOP^PSOCIDC7
 
      Outpatient Activity Logs Correction Job - set to STOP Soon
 
      Check Status to be sure it has stopped and is not running...
        
                   (D STATUS^PSOCIDC7)
 
G.  The Clean-up routine can be executed from the programmer's 
prompt instead of through the patch installation.  Also, restarting the
Clean-up routine after using the stop function described above is 
performed in the same manner.  Below is an example how to perform this 
function:
 
     &gt;D ^PSOCIDC7

2. The following correlates to the items described in number two in the
Functional Description section:
 
A. The renew process has been modified to store the changed value
for SC in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
 
B. This patch will remove all of the functionality that stored the
unnecessary IBQ node.
 
C.  Outpatient was modified to store the SC value for patients with a null
SC percentage which eliminates the sending of a "PRESCRIPTION QUESTIONS
REVIEW NEEDED" Mailman message.
 
D.  The check for the PSOSCMX variable was restored to the PSOCP
routine.  
 
E.  This patch adds the functionality to send both ZSC and ZCL segments to
CPRS. The ZSC passes SC/EI's only.  The ZCL node passes SC, EI's, and
ICD-9 Diagnosis codes.
 
F.  This patch will correctly store the third and fourth piece of the zero
node of the ICD DIAGNOSIS multiple (#52311) of PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
 
G.  The PSOHLNE3 API IA (#4666) was changed to only store entries in the 
ACTIVITY LOG multiple (#40) when SC, EI's, and/or ICD's were edited.  
For supply items and investigational drugs, no copay activity log entries 
will be stored.  Also, it was modified to prevent storage of a copay
activity log entry (copay to no copay) that was set erroneously when the
provider edits SC/EI's during sign of a verbal/telephone order leaving the
prescription as no copay.
 
H.  The RESET COPAY STATUS/CANCEL CHARGES [PSOCP RESET COPAY STATUS] 
option has been modified to not overlay the previously stored 
ICD-9 Diagnosis code with a null value and to display previously entered
SC values as a default answer.
 
I.  The B cross reference will be set for the ICD DIAGNOSIS field (#311)
in PENDING OUTPATIENT ORDERS file (#52.41) and in the ICD DIAGNOSIS field
(#52311) in PRESCRIPTION file (#52) for CPRS renewals/verbal/telephone 
orders.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This Outpatient Pharmacy patch is part of the Patient Financial Services
System (PFSS) project.  PFSS patches are being released on various
schedules.  Some patch functionality will not be active until a new PFSS
switch is activated during final implementation. PFSS will initially be
implemented at select pilot sites ONLY.
 
The purpose of the PFSS project is to prepare the Veterans Health 
Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment for
the implementation of a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) billing 
replacement system.  The project consists of the implementation of the 
billing replacement system, business process improvements, and 
enhancements to VistA to support integration with the COTS billing
replacement system.  Significant changes to VistA legacy systems and 
ancillary packages are necessary.
 
Some of the PFSS software components are not operational until the PFSS 
On/Off Switch, distributed with patch IB*2*260, is set to "ON".  The 
ability for the local site to set the switch to "ON" will be provided at 
the appropriate time with the release of a subsequent Integrated Billing 
patch.
 
For more information about the PFSS project, review the documentation 
accompanying this patch and refer to the following website: 
http://vista.domain.ext/billreplace/.
 
This Outpatient Pharmacy patch, PSO*7*201 provides the functionality
needed to support the PFSS project.  Note that this patch depends on
patches PSN*4*103 and PSS*1*92 to provide the new Charge Description
Master (CDM) functionality.  The CDM provides Service Codes for each drug,
supply item, etc. to uniquely identify them to the new COTS billing
system.  This information is passed via IB Application Program Interface
(API) calls, which is explained in the Technical Description.
 
Functional Description:
=======================
 
Outpatient Pharmacy was modified to check the status of the PFSS 
switch.  If the PFSS switch is not activated, the current Integrated 
Billing (IB) billing process will continue.  If the PFSS switch is
activated, prescription and copay information will be passed to the new
COTS billing system for final copay assessments and billing via IB.
As is currently the case with IB, the exchange of information will take
place in the background with no user impact.
 
Upon entering a new prescription order, copying, renewing, or editing 
an order that causes a new order to be created, a PFSS Account Reference
will be requested at finish from IB. This reference is used to uniquely
identify the prescription in the COTS billing system.
 
At prescription release, a unique charge identifier will be requested 
from IB, and it will serve to uniquely identify the fill in IB.  Next, a
charge message will be sent to the COTS billing system via IB.  This
includes the release of Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP)
prescriptions and prescriptions released by the Outpatient Pharmacy
Automation Interface (OPAI) functionality.
 
For return to stocks, and deletes that perform a return to stock, a charge
credit message will be sent.  
 
When Service Connection and/or Environmental Indicators are modified
without a change in copay using the Reset Copay Status/Cancel Charges
[PSOCP RESET COPAY STATUS] option, a charge update message will be sent.  
A charge credit message will be sent when copay charges are cancelled.  
When the fill is changed to copay, no message will be sent because this
change is considered to be for the future fills.
 
No messaging will take place for discontinued orders.  When a 
discontinued order is reinstated, the previously obtained PFSS Account 
Reference will be used.
 
In order to maintain the display of the "$" sign on the Medication 
Profile screen that indicates the prescription is eligible for copay, IB
will continue to be utilized for the copay eligibility assessment that is
performed at finish.  Also, the Outpatient Pharmacy and IB copay
evaluations performed at release for Service Connection, Environmental 
Indicators, Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) special handling (supply items
and investigational drugs), income exempt, and RX Patient Status checks
have not changed and will continue to be used.  However, the final copay
billing determination will be performed by the COTS billing system, and
the final decision is based on the above information, interfacility copay
information, and current IB billing rules.  There will be no return
messaging from the COTS billing system to Outpatient Pharmacy.
 
When Days Supply is edited on a released prescription, a charge update
message will be sent to the COTS billing system, and it is understood that
the COTS billing system will pick up the latest charge update.
 
Last, a new CHARGE LOCATION field (#1007) was added to the OUTPATIENT 
SITE file (#59).  This field will be used by the COTS billing system 
to group charges by division.  Upon installation and before the PFSS 
switch is turned on, the user will need to enter an Outpatient Pharmacy
charge location in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44), and afterward define
this location in the new CHARGE LOCATION field (#1007) in the OUTPATIENT
SITE file (#59).  The Site Parameter Enter/Edit [PSO SITE PARAMETERS]
option may be used to define the CHARGE LOCATION in the OUTPATIENT 
SITE file (#59).  A charge location should be defined for each division in
the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59). It is suggested that this field be
coordinated with the Medical Center's billing office and the activation of
the PFSS functionality.  If at least one division has a CHARGE LOCATION
defined, that value will be passed to the COTS billing system for all 
division having prescriptions filled. If the CHARGE LOCATION is not
defined for any division and the PFSS switch is turned on, the
prescription information will not pass to IB or the COTS billing system.
 
 
Technical Description:
======================
 
At FINISH of the prescription fill:
 
1. The new IB API #4664 GETACCT^IBBAPI will be called to request a PFSS
ACCOUNT REFERENCE and it will be stored in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) on
the fill level. For original fills, it will be stored in the PFSS ACCOUNT
REFERENCE field (#125), and for refills it will be stored in the PFSS
ACCOUNT REFERENCE field (#21). These references uniquely identify the
prescription to the COTS billing system.
 
2. The array of data passed using the GETACCT^IBBAPI call encompasses all 
of the minimum required data elements as stated in the PFSS SRS-SDD IBB 
Generic API document.  The following outlines data passed from 
Outpatient Pharmacy:
 
  $$GETACCT^IBBAPI(VAR1,VAR2,VAR3,VAR4,.ARR1,,,.ARR4,.ARR5,VAR5,,)
    Where:  
      VAR1 = Patient Identifier (Patient IEN)  
      VAR2 = PFSS Account Reference  
      VAR3 = HL7 Event Code          
      VAR4 = Application Location Reference
      ARR1 = ARR1(2) Patient Class, ARR1(3) Patient Location,
                  ARR1(7) Attending Physician, ARR1(44) Admit 
                  Date/Time (Fill Date), ARR1(50) Alternant Visit
                  ID (Prescription IEN)
      ARR4 = ARR4(n,3) Diagnoses Code, ARR4(n,6) Diagnosis Type 
      ARR5 = ARR5(n,2) Type
      VAR5 = Medical Center Division
 
3. After IB returns the PFSS ACCOUNT REFERENCE to Outpatient Pharmacy,
IB will pass the GETACCT information to the COTS billing system via the
VistA Data Extraction Framework (VDEF) and will store the returned PFSS
Account Number external value in the PFSS ACCOUNT file (#375).
 
 
At RELEASE of the prescription fill:
 
1. The new IB API # 4665 GETCHGID^IBBAPI will be called to request a PFSS
CHARGE ID.  This information is used to uniquely identify the fill in the
IB and will be stored in Prescription file (#52) on the fill level. For
original fills, it will be stored in the PFSS CHARGE ID field (#126), and
for refills it will be stored in the PFSS CHARGE ID field (#22).  No data
is passed using this API.
 
2. Next, the new IB API #4665 CHARGE^IBBAPI will be called to pass
prescription and copay information.  This information will be stored in
the PFSS CHARGE CACHE file (#373).  IB will batch the charge information
and pass it on to the COTS billing system via VDEF.
 
3. The array of data passed using the CHARGE^IBBAPI call encompasses all 
of the minimum required data elements as stated in the PFSS SRS-SDD IBB 
Generic API document.  The following outlines data passed from Outpatient
Pharmacy:
 
     $$CHARGE^IBBAPI(VAR1,VAR2,VAR3,VAR4,.ARR1,,.ARR3,.ARR4,.ARR5,,,)
       Where:
         VAR1 = Patient Identifier (Patient IEN)              
         VAR2 = PFSS Account Reference  
         VAR3 = Charge Type               
         VAR4 = Unique Charge ID (PFSS Charge ID)
         ARR1 = ARR1(4) Transaction Date (Fill Date), ARR1(7) Transaction
                  Code, ARR1(10) Transaction Quantity, ARR1(13) Department
                  Code, ARR1(18) Patient Copay Status, ARR1(21) Ordered by
                  Code, ARR1(22) Unit Cost, ARR1(29) NDC_";"_Generic
                  Name, ARR1(31) Copay Transaction Type
         ARR3 = ARR3(n,3) Diagnoses Code, ARR3(n,6) Diagnosis Type
         ARR4 = ARR4(n,2) Type
         ARR5 = ARR5(1) Quantity_";;"_Days Supply, ARR5(17) Refills 
                  Dispensed (Fill Number), ARR5(18) Date of Most Recent
                  Fill (Release Date), ARR5(31) DEA, Special Handling
 
4. There will be no return messaging from the COTS billing system to 
Outpatient Pharmacy.  Note that IB will combine the data passed in the
GETACCT and CHARGE APIs to form the charge message that will ultimately
be passed to the COTS billing system via VDEF.
 
 
CHARGE LOCATION additions:
 
1. In the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59), a new CHARGE LOCATION field 
(#1007) was added, and this field is a pointer to HOSPITAL LOCATION file 
(#44).
 
2. The Site Parameter Enter/Edit [PSO SITE PARAMETERS] option input
template PSO SITE was modified to accommodate entry of the new CHARGE
LOCATION field (#1007).
 
3. If a CHARGE LOCATION is not defined for a particular division, the 
system will loop through all divisions in the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) 
and will use the first CHARGE LOCATION it finds.  When none of the
divisions have a CHARGE LOCATION defined, the prescription will not be 
passed to IB or the COTS billing system.  This issue will be addressed in
a subsequent phase of the PFSS project.  Until that time, it is imperative
that CHARGE LOCATION are defined for each division.
 
The Integration Agreement (IA) #4732 was created to facilitate 
modifications being made by IB for interfacility copay.  It will be used 
in the background to return the pharmacist, person who last edited the 
prescription fill, and the value of the IB SERVICE/SECTION field (#1003) 
from the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59).

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;245 SEQ #222</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2006-11-22 23:44:29</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch adds three new Outpatient Pharmacy Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs).
 
The first API (DIQ) requires five parameters to be passed in and data
from the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) will be returned.  This API will invoke
the EN^DIQ1 FileMan call and data will be returned to the calling
application as specified in the EN^DIQ1 FileMan documentation.
 
The second API (STATUS) requires three parameters to be passed in and data
from the STATUS field (#100) from the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) is
returned.  This API will invoke the FIELD^DID FileMan call and data will
be returned to the calling application as specified in the FIELD^DID
FileMan documentation.
 
The third API (DIC) has three parameters and retrieves information 
specific to the PRESCRIPTION file (#52).  This API will invoke the ^DIC 
FileMan call and data will be returned to the calling application as 
specified in the ^DIC FileMan documentation.
 
For more information, please see Forum DBIA 4858, or the Pharmacy
Re-Engineering (PRE) API Manual.
 
This patch also corrects a problem with the PROF^PSO52API API.  The first
node of data returned is meant to return both the PRESCRIPTION NUMBER and
it's IEN.  Currently, the IEN is not returned.  This patch will correct
the problem.
 
This patch also corrects a problem with the PSO^PSO53 API.  Currently 
there is an undefined error when the API is run.  This patch will correct 
the problem and ensure the functionality of the PSO^PSO53 API call.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch will produce a tally report in the form of a Mailman message 
for all prescriptions with missing expiration dates and prescriptions that
are past their expiration dates but have an active status.  It also 
contains corrections for two remedy tickets.
 
1.  The tally report will be sent to the person who installs the patch at 
the site and to management on FORUM via the MailMan utility. It will be
used to determine if a national patch needs to be created for correcting
this issue.
 
During installation of this patch, the user may select to run the tally 
immediately or queue it to run at a later date and time. Should it be 
necessary to stop the job for emergency or to know the status of the job,
a status and stop function is provided.
 
To stop the job, log into programmer's mode and type the D STOP^PSOTEXP1 
at the command prompt.  The following is an example:
 
     &gt;D STOP^PSOTEXP1                
 
     TALLY MISSING EXPIRATION DATES Job - set to STOP Soon
 
     Check Status to be sure it has stopped and is not running...
          (D STATUS^PSOTEXP1)
 
To check the status of the TALLY MISSING EXPIRATION DATES job, log 
into programmer's mode and type D STATUS^PSOTEXP1 at the command prompt.  
The following is an example:
 
     &gt;D STATUS^PSOTEXP1              
 
     Currently processing:
     Date being processed &gt; Dec 09, 2005
                     RX # &gt; 3011493
 
To restart the job, the patch must be re-installed.
 
The following is an example of the MailMan message that will be sent to
management and the user who installs the patch:

2.  Remedy tickets 166505 and 166485 related to patch PSO*7*239:
 
A.  It was reported that for two sites the CIDC Activity Log Clean-up
process did not complete, no error was recorded, and no MailMan message
was received stating the job completed.  It was found that the problem
resulted from a prescription being locked by another process for an
extended amount of time which resulted in the CIDC Clean-up process
stopping.  For consistency in the routines at all sites, the modification
to correct this issue is being included in this patch.  If your site 
received the MailMan message stating that the CIDC ACTIVITY LOGS 
CORRECTION job completed, no action should be taken.  Otherwise after 
installation of this patch, run the CIDC Clean-up routine from
programmer's mode to complete the process:
 
    &gt;D ^PSOCIDC7
 
The clean-up routine will store any prescription that cannot be locked
for correction.  The completion mailman message was modified to notate 
whether such problems occurred.  If there is not a notation stating 
prescriptions were locked, no further action is needed.  Otherwise 
from the programmer's prompt type the following to print a report:
 
    &gt;D LOCKED^PSOCIDC9
 
The prescriptions on the locked prescription report may be individually 
corrected manually by typing the following at the programmer's prompt:
 
    &gt;D FIXONE^PSOCIDC9
 
The prescription number will be prompted, and a message stating that the
activity logs were corrected will be displayed.  If the manual clean-up
process still cannot lock the prescription in order to correct the
activity logs, a message stating such will be displayed.  Otherwise, a
message will be displayed that no corrections are needed.  Each
prescription completed is notated as such and reprinting the
LOCKED^PSOCIDC9 report will show "completed" after each one.
 
 
B.  It was reported that an error occurred when the RPT^PSOCIDC9 report
was queued to a printer.  This patch corrects the queuing of the report to
a printer.  To generate the report of all prescriptions affected by the
clean-up process, enter the following at the programmer's prompt:
 
    &gt;D RPT^PSOCIDC9

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch contains the first quarter enhancements for the Outpatient
Pharmacy V. 7.0 package. It provides the following updates to
functionality:
 
1. The Action Profile (132 COLUMN PRINTOUT) [PSO ACTION PROFILE] option is
modified to provide the following functionality:
   a. It will print only the last 4 digits of the Social Security Number
      (SSN) instead of the full 9 digits.
   b. The Prescription status of "Suspended" will now print as
      "Active/Susp". This change is also shared with the Application
      Program Interface (API) number 1281, provided to Computerized
      Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0 to return "Active/Susp" instead
      of "Suspended".
   c. As a result of the installation of patch PSO*7*233, if a bad address
      is indicated, "BAD ADDRESS INDICATED-" followed by the reason
      ("UNDELIVERABLE", "HOMELESS", or "OTHER") was being printed. Once
      PSO*7*258 is installed, "**BAD ADDRESS INDICATED**" will be printed
      but will not be followed by the reason.
 
2. The Medication Profile [PSO P] option will now print the last 4 digits
of the SSN instead of the full 9 digits.
 
3. When finishing a pending order using the Patient Prescription
Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option or using the Complete Orders
from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option, the following changes were
made:
   a. The provider comments are displayed in the first screen. When the
      following prompt is displayed:
 
      Copy Provider Comments into the Patient Instructions? No//
 
      the user has to scroll the screen up to know what the provider
      comments are. To avoid this problem, the provider comments are
      displayed along with this prompt.
 
   b. A problem was reported with the calculated quantity for the drug
      Clozapine. A patient safety incident (PSI-06-146) was entered. The
      solution provided is as follows:
      If the drug has possible dosages defined, a quantity can be
      calculated. If this quantity is less than the quantity placed in
      CPRS, the calculated quantity will be displayed. Otherwise, the
      quantity placed in CPRS will be displayed. If there are no possible
      dosages defined then a quantity cannot be calculated and the message
      "Unable to calculate the quantity, enter a quantity" is displayed to
      the user in the ListMan message bar as a warning of a possible
      quantity issue. For Clozapine orders, since Outpatient Pharmacy
      might change the days supply and quantity placed in CPRS, the days
      supply and quantity have been added to the existing refill message.
      Here is an example of an order placed in CPRS with a days supply
      of 60 and a quantity of 60 for a patient eligible for 28 days
      supply:
 
      (6)     Issue Date: OCT 26,2006        (7) Fill Date: OCT 27,2006
     Patient Eligible for 28 Day Sup. or 14 Day with 1 refill or 7 Day
     with 3 refill
      (8)    Days Supply: 28                (9)   QTY (TAB): 28
            Provider ordered 0 refills, days supply of 60 and a qty of 60
 
 
4. After the release of patch PSO*7*233 some issues were identified and
are being corrected in this patch:
   a. If a hold reason of "8 (PER PATIENT REQUEST)" or "99 (OTHER--SEE
      COMMENTS)" was entered, some options were displaying reason "7 (BAD
      ADDRESS)" instead. This patch corrects that problem.
 
   b. The function call $$CHKRX^PSOBAI was missing a value on some quit
      statements. Although the affected lines of code should never be
      encountered, this patch corrects the problem.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
For the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
National Provider Identifier (NPI) project, this patch will create and
populate the new NPI INSTITUTION field (#101) in the OUTPATIENT SITE file
(#59). This patch will also change the Site Parameter Enter/Edi [PSO SITE
PARAMETERS] option to allow the user to edit this new field as shown
below:
 
       NAME: ALBANY// 
 
       ...
 
       Select CPRS ORDERING INSTITUTION:
       RELATED INSTITUTION: ALBANY// 
       NPI INSTITUTION: ALBANY// 
   
       ...
  
When this patch is installed, the information in this field will be 
automatically populated through a post-install routine. The correct
institution will be identified using the existing NCPDP NUMBER field
(#1008) in the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59), along with a list of
pre-defined NPI numbers, which should match to NPI numbers previously 
assigned to each institution by the KERNEL V. 8.0 patch XU*8*410.
   
The PSO SITE input template is being changed to include this new field.
Therefore, the user will be able to manually add/edit/delete the NPI
INSTITUTION field through the Site Parameter Enter/Edit [PSO SITE
PARAMETERS] option.
  
**************************************************************************
NOTE: All active outpatient sites MUST have an NPI INSTITUTION assigned.
This is very important for sites currently performing third party
electronic billing (ePharmacy) because the NPI number will replace the 
previous NCPDP (National Council for Prescription Drug Programs) number 
used to identify the dispensing pharmacy. 
**************************************************************************
 
For active sites that do not have an NPI INSTITUTION assigned after the
installation of this patch, using the Site Parameter Enter/Edit [PSO SITE
PARAMETERS] option enter the correct institution for each site. In order
to help you identify which sites have and which ones have not been 
assigned an NPI INSTITUTION, the post-install routine will generate a 
Mailman message which will be sent to the user installing the patch as 
well as all the holders of the PSORPH security key. Below is an example
of the Mailman message:

<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2007-06-29 21:06:24</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch includes two new routines, PSO52EX and PSO52B.  It also
enhances functionality and resolves two problems in PSO52API.
 
PSO52EX is a new routine containing two Application Programmer Interfaces
(APIs).  The first API is named EXTRACT.  EXTRACT retrieves data from the
"AL" and "AM" cross references within the PRESCRIPTION file (#52).  
EXTRACT requires three parameters: SDATE, EDATE, and LIST.  SDATE is the
start date to retrieve data from.  EDATE is the end date to retrieve data
from.  LIST is the name that is used to subscript the returned data into a
^TMP global.  Once these values are set by the user, EXTRACT will then
extract all original fill information.  If a selected patient also has
refill or partial fill information on record, that information will also
be returned and subscripted accordingly.  The output is stored on the ^TMP
global.  The second API is named REF.  REF also requires the same three
parameters: SDATE, EDATE, and LIST.  It will retrieve information stored
on the "AD" cross reference in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and return it
to the ^TMP global. Refer to Forum DBIA 4902 for complete information.
 
PSO52B is a new routine that contains a number of subroutines that have 
been moved from PSO52API.  This was done to ensure that PSO52API will 
continue to be within Programming Standards and Conventions (SAC) routine 
size limits.  PSO52B also enhances the RX^PSO52API component by retrieving
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) information from the
PRESCRIPTION file (#52).  The user now has the option to pass in "ICD" in
the NODE parameter of the RX^PSO52API call and retrieve information
specific to the patient(s) concerning their ICD. Refer to the Application
Programmer Interface (API) manual for further instruction on the use of
this API.
 
This patch also corrects two other issues within PSO52API.  Currently   if
the user passes in only an end date, the API will error.  This patch will
correct this problem.  Also, when "O" is passed in the NODE parameter to
retrieve the ORDERABLE ITEM field (#39.2) from the PRESCRIPTION file
(#52), the code will now return data as stated in the API manual without
representing the field number in its ^TMP global subscript.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;243 SEQ #230</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2007-09-04 22:56:26</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Remote Data Interoperability (RDI) functionality includes receiving data
from the Health Data Repository (HDR) in order to perform order checking
against outpatient prescription and allergy data from remote VA or
Department of Defense (DoD) facilities.
 
When RDI is turned on (by the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)
patch OR*3*238), the RDI order checking checks the current drug being 
ordered for duplicate drugs, duplicate drug classes, drug-drug
interactions, and drug allergies.
 
 
This patch contains the following changes for RDI order checking:
 
1. Prescriptions with a status of "DELETED" in the STATUS field (#100) in
the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) from a remote facility should not be included
in order checks. This patch filters out DELETED remote prescriptions.
 
2. Some older prescriptions do not have an expiration date in the 
EXPIRATION DATE field (#26) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52). This patch
restricts prescriptions with a missing expiration date from being used in
remote order checks unless the ISSUE DATE (#1) field of the PRESCRIPTION
file (#52) is within the past year.
 
3. Drugs not matched to the National Drug file were not performing remote 
order checks. These drugs could have a drug class defined. This patch 
adds the remote order check for drug class when orders are placed for 
locally defined drugs.
 
4. When Adverse Reaction Tracking (ART) patch GMRA*4*26 is installed at a
site, this patch adds the display of LOCAL, REMOTE SITE(S), or LOCAL AND
REMOTE SITE(S) to allergy order checks to indicate whether the allergy
entry originated at the local site or it came from a remote site. For
backdoor outpatient pharmacy, currently only the drug class code and not
the drug class name is displayed for an allergy drug class order check.
This patch adds the display of the class name.
 
Example:
 
A Drug-Allergy Reaction exists for this medication and/or class!
 
Drug: AMOXICILLIN 250MG CAP
Drug Class: AM110 PENICILLIN-G RELATED PENICILLINS (LOCAL)
 
 
5. When the VUID field (#99.99) of the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) of a
remote prescription is inactive, every order being placed incorrectly
displayed a duplicate drug order check. This patch corrects that problem.
 
6. Remote order checking against remote discontinued or expired outpatient
prescriptions is changed to perform the order check if the remote 
prescription was expired or discontinued in the last 30 days instead of 
within the last 120 days.
 
7. During testing of RDI, a problem was discovered with the order checks
involving remote allergy classes. Not all of the remote allergies were
being retrieved from the HDR. A change was made to use a different
Application Program Interface (API) to the allergy package that does 
retrieve the remote data.
 
8. An issue with too many false positive order checks was discovered when 
doing allergy order checks on certain drug classes. Analgesics, as a
class, were performing order checks across all members. For example: class
CN101 was generating an order check for class CN102. This patch corrects
this problem by ensuring that allergy Analgesic class order checks only
match against the specific 5-character class if the class begins with 
"CN10".
 
9. One feature of RDI is the notification to the user when processing 
orders that only local data is being used if the remote data is 
unavailable. Several sites reported issues with this mechanism. This 
patch corrects this problem by performing the check for remote data 
availability upon entering the patient's chart, rather than on each order.
 
10. The list of remote allergies is added to allergy/adverse reaction 
portion of the Medication Profile. If a patient has the same allergy
information from several remote sites, it will only be listed once.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 This patch contains the FY 2007 Quarter 2 Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0
enhancements. 
 
 
***** NOTE TO SITES USING AUTOMATED FILLING EQUIPMENT *****
Please ensure that your vendor is aware of the changes being made by this 
patch. There are changes (described below) that affect both the HEALTH 
LEVEL SEVEN (HL7) messages (content of fields only - no new fields are
added) and the laser label stream.
 
If you are using automated dispensing equipment that relies on 
the data stream sent to the laser labels port, you have 2 options:
  1. Implement the Outpatient Automation Interface (OPAI) (available with
     released patch PSO*7*156) or 
  2. Contact your vendor to make adjustments based on the new data stream.
 
 
Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI) enhancements: 
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Modified to use the new commercial warning label source to send the
warning label text to the automated filling equipment. The OPAI WARNING
LABEL SOURCE field (#16.2) in the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7) must be set
to "N" for "New" to send the warning labels from the new commercial data
source to OPAI. It can be set by using the Pharmacy System Parameters Edit
[PSS SYS EDIT] option.
 Example:
 
Select OPTION NAME: PSS SYS EDIT       Pharmacy System Parameters Edit
Pharmacy System Parameters Edit
 
PMIS PRINTER: L8150$PRT// 
PMIS LANGUAGE: English// 
WARNING LABEL SOURCE: NEW// 
CMOP WARNING LABEL SOURCE: NEW//
OPAI WARNING LABEL SOURCE: ?
     Enter "N" for NEW to use commercial data source for OPAI warning 
labels.
     Choose from: 
       N        NEW
OPAI WARNING LABEL SOURCE: N  NEW
 
   a. The warning text is sent as one record per warning.
   b. The text is sent in English or Spanish depending on the patient's
      other language settings. 
   c. If the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) in the DRUG file (#50) begins
      with numbers 1,2,3,4, or 5, the NO TRANSFER warning text from the RX
      CONSULT file (#54) entry number 20 is automatically sent as one of
      the first 5 warnings when the OPAI WARNING LABEL SOURCE is set to 
      "New".
 
 
2. If the BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR (BAI) field (#.121) of the PATIENT file
(#2) is set and the routing is WINDOW, the text "VAB" concatenated with
the BAI code is sent in the Address field of the PID segment of the HL7
message to the filling equipment.
 
Here are some examples of this field:
 
When the permanent address is active:
PADD-1~PADD-2~SPRING~TX~77379~~P~PADD-3~201^~~""~""~~~N|""|||||||
|
 
When the temporary address is active:
PADD-1~PADD-2~SPRING~TX~77379~~P~PADD-3~201^~~""~""~~~N^TADD-1~TADD-2 
TADD-3~PLANO~TX~12345~~C~~""~~~
^HL(772,10388,"IN",2,0)=20070223&amp;""|""|||||||||
 
When the address is flagged as BAI:
PADD-1~PADD-2~SPRING~TX~77379~~VAB1~PADD-3~201^~~""~""~~~N|""||||||
|||
 
"VAB1" - indicates Bad Address Indicator and 1 is for UNDELIVERABLE (2 for
HOMELESS, 3 for OTHER)
 
 
Laser Label enhancements:
-------------------------
1. Print the last 4 digits of the Social Security Number (SSN) instead of
the last 6 digits.
 
2. Change the name on the mailing label back to Last name,First name
format.
 
3. On the Pharmacy Fill Card portion of the label, replace the text 
"Mfr ___________________" with:
   a. NDC/MFR_______________ for non-ePharmacy sites
   b. NDC nnnnn-nnnn-nn for ePharmacy sites 
 
4. Signature log enhancements:
   a. Print current date at top
   b. Do not print user name (if more than 1 prescription was included to
      be signed, the user name could be different for each one).
   c. Correct the spacing and continuation paging issues if one or more 
      of the prescriptions has been discontinued before printing the 
      signature log.
   d. Add a barcode to enable scanning to remove the patient's name from 
      the Bingo Board.
   e. Add as much of the drug name as will fit on the label.
   f. Add hidden action "RS" for Reprint Signature log to the prescription
      profile screen.
   g. While printing original labels (not reprint of the signature log), 
      if all of the fills have a routing of mail, the signature log will
      not be printed.
   h. The line "Relationship_________________ Counseled? _____" is changed
      to "Relation_____ Counseling Refused__ Accepted__".
 
 
5. When a fill is released, if the BAI is no longer set or there is an 
active temporary address, the "B" is removed from the status column of 
the patient profile. (This is removed by making an additional entry in 
the label log. The "B" comes from the "last" entry having a bad address 
condition at the time the label printed).
 
 
 
To address E3R 19820, the following code changes are included in this 
patch:
 
1. Add the capability to tie a ScripTalk printer to regular Pharmacy
label printer(s) to control where the ScripTalk labels print for
multi-divisional sites. The new SCRIPTALK PRINT DEVICE MAPPING multiple
(#47) in PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7) has been created to store this
information in Pharmacy Data Management patch PSS*1*122. The multiple
contains PRINTER TO BE MAPPED field (#.01) and SCRIPTALK DEVICE field
(#.02).
 
The added functionality works in conjunction with the existing ScripTalk 
divisional functionality, so a divisional ScripTalk device must be
defined.  If no mapping is defined in the new fields, ScripTalk labels
will continue to print on the printer defined for the division.  If
a pharmacy printer is mapped to a ScripTalk printer, the ScripTalk label
will automatically be printed on the mapped ScripTalk printer.
 
 
2. Modify the ScripTalk Device Definition Enter/Edit [PSO SCRIPTALK
DEVICE DEF'N] option to allow definition of printer mapping for 
ScripTalk devices.  The user will be prompted to define the ScripTalk 
printer by division or by printer mapping.  After selecting D for 
division, the divisional definition has not changed.  After selecting 
P for printer mapping, the user will be prompted "LABEL PRINTER TO BE
MAPPED". The device entered into this field corresponds to the label
printer selected during Pharmacy login and/or the printer selected during
print from suspense functions. Next, "SCRIPTALK DEVICE" will be prompted,
and this field should contain the ScripTalk printer to be mapped to the
regular label printer.
 
 
MISCELLANEOUS ENHANCEMENTS:
---------------------------
1. A new field FINISH DATE/TIME field (#38.3) is added to the
PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
 
2. When using the Print from Suspense File [PSO PNDLBL] option, if the
routing is not WINDOW and the BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR (#.121) field of the
PATIENT file (#2) is set (value of 1=UNDELIVERABLE, 2=HOMELESS, 3=OTHER)
and the patient does not have an active temporary address, the
prescription fill will not be sent to automated filling equipment and/or
to the label printer. Also, if the fill's routing is mail and the 
patient's MAIL field (#.03) in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) is set to
"DO NOT MAIL" and the current date is before the MAIL STATUS EXPIRATION
DATE field (#.05) in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55), the label will not
print and the fill will not be sent to the automated filling equipment.
 
The first time a prescription is not sent/label printed, a MailMan message
will be generated to the user who queued the print from suspense and the
members of the PSO EXTERNAL DISPENSE ALERTS mail group. An entry will also
be set in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) activity log.
 
Example activity log entry:
---------------------------
Activity Log:
#   Date        Reason         Rx Ref           Initiator Of Activity
=====================================================================
1   02/19/07    SUSPENSE       ORIGINAL         OPPHARMACIST,ONE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----
The following prescriptions with a routing of mail were not printed/sent 
to
external interface due to the BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR being set and no 
active
temporary address or patient has an active MAIL status of DO NOT MAIL:
 
OPPATIENT,ONE   000001234   (BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR)
  100002608  (1)  A AND Z OINTMENT

OPPATIENT,FOUR   000004321   (DO NOT MAIL)
  100002654A  (0)  BACITRACIN OINTMENT 1OZ
 
 
3. Modify the report from the Bad Address Suspended List [PSO BAI 
SUSPENDED] option to allow printing by more than one division and also 
include prescriptions suspended for Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy 
(CMOP). This report was also changed to not prompt for a start date.
 
Example:
--------
Select OPTION NAME: PSO BAI SUSPENDED     Bad Address Suspended List

This option shows unprinted suspended prescriptions for patients who have 
the
BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR set in the PATIENT file and no active temporary

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch is part of the third quarter enhancements release for
the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 package.
 
As per the Health Data Repository (HDR) request, thirteen new data fields
were added to the current Outpatient Pharmacy Vista Data Extraction
Framework (VDEF) HEALTH LEVEL SEVEN (HL7) message that sends prescription
information to the HDR.
 
This patch affects the background HL7 processing only; users will not see
any functional changes.
 
For more information on the addition of the thirteen new data fields,
please refer to Appendix D of the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 Technical
Manual / Security Guide that is being updated with this patch.
 
This patch also corrects the problem of a VDEF message not being sent to
the HDR when a refill is deleted from a prescription as a result of the
refill being returned to stock.
 
**** VERY IMPORTANT ****
 
You must suspend the VDEF Request Queue before installing this patch and
then re-enable it after installation of the patch. Keep in mind that the
suspension of the VDEF Request Queue will not prevent any new requests in
Outpatient Pharmacy VDEF Domain application from being added to the VDEF
Request Queue, it will only delay the building of these VDEF HL7 messages
until the VDEF Request Queue is enabled again. The steps for doing that
are outlined in the Installation Instructions section.
 
 
MISCELLANEOUS FIXES:
--------------------
1. The hidden action "RS" for Reprint Signature log that was sent in
patch PSO*7*200, was overwriting the action "OTH" for Other OP Actions,
making the OTH action unavailable. The post-install routine PSOP261
included in this patch (PSO*7*261) fixes this.
 
2. An undefined error was identified by a site that went live with Remote
Data Interoperability (RDI) patches. A common variable was being killed by
another package. The fix is to save the value of the variable before
making the call to retrieve remote allergy data and to restore the
variable to the saved value once control is returned to the calling
routine.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch enhances the functionality of PSODI, PSO59, and PSO52EX.
 
PSODI contains a new Application Programmer Interface (API) named GET1.
This API will invoke the $$GET1^DIQ FileMan Database Server (DBS) call and
is to be used as an extrinsic function.  GET1 has five parameters:
 
   PSOFILE: FILE OR SUBFILE NUMBER TO RETRIEVE DATA FROM [REQUIRED]
   PSOIEN: IEN TO RETRIEVE DATA FROM [REQUIRED] 
   PSOFIELD: FIELD TO RETRIEVE DATA FROM [REQUIRED] 
   PSOFLAGS: CONTROLS THE PROCESSING OF DATA RETURNED [OPTIONAL] 
   PSOWORD: RETURN OF WORD PROCESSING FIELDS [REQUIRED only with word 
   processing fields]
 
If a file access error is encountered, the calling application will have
"0^FILE ACCESS ERROR" returned.  If a FileMan error has occurred, the
calling application will have "0^FILEMAN UNABLE TO PROCESS REQUEST"
returned.  A successful data retrieval will return in the format "1^(FIELD
DATA)".  When retrieving data from a word processing field, an array name
must be passed in to PSOWORD.  Once the word processing field is returned,
it will then populate an array as defined by PSOWORD and the calling
application will have "1^(PSOWORD)" returned.  If there is no data in the
Word Processing field, the calling application will have "1^" returned,
and the array defined by PSOWORD will be empty.
 
Please see the VA FileMan Programmer Manual V. 22.0 for $$GET1^DIQ input
definitions and DBIA 4858 for further description.
 
PSO59 retrieves data from the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) and has three 
parameters: PSOIEN (optional), PSOTXT (optional), and LIST (required).  
While PSOIEN and PSOTXT are both labeled as optional, PSO59 requires that 
either parameter be passed in or no data will be returned.  PSOIEN is the 
internal entry number (IEN) of a site, PSOTXT is a free text entry that 
works as a search parameter, and LIST is the subscript name used in the 
^TMP global. The new functionality now allows the user to pass in "??" to 
retrieve all divisions in the file and subscripts them accordingly.  If 
both an IEN and "??" are passed in, PSO59 will ignore the "??" and return
data specific to the IEN.  
 
Please refer to DBIA 4827 for further description on PSO59.
 
PSO52EX contains a new Application Programmer Interface (API) named 
ARXREF. This API is to be used as an extrinsic function call and requires
three parameters: PSODATE, PSOIEN, and PSOFILL.  PSODATE is the RELEASED 
DATE/TIME field (#31) and PSOIEN is the internal entry number from the 
PRESCRIPTION file (#52).  PSOFILL is the fill number of prescription (0 
for Original Fill, 1 for Refill #1, 2 for Refill #2, etc.).  The user can
set a local variable equal to the return value of ARXREF. If the return
value equals:
 
   0 (zero) = Data does not exist in the "AR" cross reference, indicating
   the fill was not dispensed from the Consolidated Mail Outpatient
   Pharmacy (CMOP).
 
   1 (one) = Data does exist in the "AR" cross reference, indicating the
   fill was dispensed from the CMOP.
 
Please refer to DBIA 4902 for further description on PSO52EX.

This patch is part of the third quarter enhancements release for the
Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 package.
 
1. With the deployment of Cache version 5, it was discovered that the
   short lock timeout values could generate a lock failure. Patch
   DI*22*147, which has already been released, provided a solution to
   resolve this issue and future lock issues.
 
   This patch instituted a new default lock timeout of three seconds based
   on a global node setting of ^DD("DILOCKTM")=3.
 
   In order to avoid the lock issue in Outpatient Pharmacy, this patch
   modifies all routines that currently use a lock timeout value of less
   than 3 seconds to check for the node ^DD("DILOCKTM") and to use the
   value defined there, otherwise the lock timeout value is set to a
   default value of 3 seconds.
 
2. PSI-06-186  - Changing dispense drug and SIG
   When finishing a new order using the Patient Prescription Processing
   [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, and answering "NO" to the prompt
   "Is this correct? YES//", the software allows the option to edit
   the dispense drug. It allows you to select any active drug from the
   DRUG file (#50) and accept the order even though the entered SIG is
   incorrect. This patch will not list all the active drugs for selection
   during dispense drug edit, but will list only those drugs that are tied
   to that orderable item in the DRUG file (#50).
 
   When the dispense drug is changed the software prompts "Do You want to
   Edit the SIG?  NO//." To read the current SIG you may have to scroll
   the screen up. This patch will now display the current SIG along with
   the prompt "Do You want to Edit the SIG? YES//."
 
   A similar modification is also done in this patch for editing an
   existing prescription and the dispense drug is changed, to display the
   current SIG along with the prompt "Do You want to Edit the SIG? YES//."
 
   When finishing a pending order through the backdoor, the software
   allows the option to edit the orderable item and select a different
   dispense drug, but does not prompt you to change the SIG. This can
   lead to incorrect SIG. This patch will now prompt the question
   "Do You want to Edit the SIG? YES//."
 
3. This patch adds SERVICE REJECT to the current list of selection for
   the Nature of Order prompt.
   Example:
 
   Nature of Order: WRITTEN// ?
   Choose from:
   1            WRITTEN     W
   2            VERBAL     V
   3            TELEPHONED     P
   4            SERVICE CORRECTION     S
   5            POLICY     I
   6            DUPLICATE     D
   12           SERVICE REJECT     R
 
4. PSI-06-184 - Enhancements for No Allergy Assessment
   The following changes are included to make the pharmacist aware/act on
   prescriptions if they're being entered/finished for a patient with no
   allergy assessment:
   a. Within the profile information, display "No Allergy Assessment"
      next to the allergy header (like "NKA" currently shows)
 
   b. At the same spot where checking for bad address, add a check for
      no allergy assessment and provide a message to the user. (When the
      user continues on, he could choose EA to enter allergy information,
      stop with that patient, or continue on with ordering or finishing).
 
   c. On the profile header, on the right side of the line with patient
      name where &lt;A&gt; currently shows in reverse video if the patient has
      any allergy/adverse reaction information on file, show  &lt;NO ALLERGY
      ASSESSMENT&gt; in reverse video if no assessment has been done.
 
   d. If the pharmacist proceeds with drug entry for a patient with no
      allergy assessment, prompt to intervene just as if there had been an
      allergy reaction and treat this like a critical interaction. (i.e.
      require them to choose to continue processing and if so, prompt for
      an intervention.
 
      Note: When flagging is available in backdoor Outpatient Pharmacy for
      pending orders, procedurally sites can choose to flag pending orders
      for patients awaiting an allergy assessment.
 
5. The patient's eligibility will be displayed before prompting for
   patient status when finishing prescriptions or entering new orders (to
   ensure that the proper entry from the RX PATIENT STATUS file (#53) is
   being selected. This is stored in the PATIENT STATUS field (#3) of the
   PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55)):
   a. In the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
      option, redisplay the eligibility just before prompting for patient
      status.
 
   b. In the Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option, after
      displaying patient name, display eligibility and prompt for patient
      status.
 
   c. In both options, use RX PATIENT STATUS: for the prompt instead of
      PATIENT STATUS:
 
 
Example 1 - Patient Prescription Processing:
Select Action: Next Screen// NO   New Order
 
Eligibility: SERVICE CONNECTED 50% to 100%     SC%: 60
RX PATIENT STATUS: AUTH ABS -96//
 
Example 2 - Complete Orders from OERR:
Select By:  (PA/RT/PR/CL/E): PATIENT// ROUTE
Route:  (W/M/C/E): WINDOW// MAIL
 
 
 
          OPPATIENT,ONE (666-00-0777)
     No Allergy Assessment!
 
Eligibility: NSC
RX PATIENT STATUS: OPT NSC//
 
6. In the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
   option, if the Patient Update "PU" action is chosen and the PATIENT
   STATUS is changed to a new one, when returning to the option and
   choosing "NO" for New Order, the default PATIENT STATUS displayed is
   the one before the PU change was done. This patch makes a correction
   to refresh the PATIENT STATUS before displaying the default.
 
7. When selecting a patient in the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO
   LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option or the Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE
   FINISH] option, if Remote Data Interoperability (RDI) is turned on, a
   check has been added to check for the ability to access remote data.
   If a problem has been detected with accessing remote data, the patient
   selection will display "Remote data not available - Only local order
   checks processed." once per patient rather than for each individual
   order.
 
8. If the MAIL STATUS EXPIRATION DATE field (#.05) in the PHARMACY PATIENT
   file (#55) is less than today, the MAIL field (#.03) displays on
   the patient profile as if it is still active. This patch adds the
   display of the MAIL STATUS EXPIRATION DATE field next to the MAIL
   field on the patient profile for MAIL settings of Do Not Mail, Local -
   Regular Mail and Local - Certified Mail if the mail status is expired.
 
9. Following the installation of patch PSO*7*200, a site noticed that 6
   digits of the social security number were printing when using the new
   hidden "RS" action to reprint the signature log. This patch changes it
   to 4 digits to match the rest of the labels.
 
10. In patch PSO*7*200, functionality was provided to use the new
    commercial warning label to send prescriptions to the automated
    filling equipment. One site reported a problem when using the old
    warning labels, that the HEALTH LEVEL SEVEN (HL7) message sent to
    Optifill was causing an error. This happens when the label text length
    is greater than 512 characters. To prevent this error, this patch
    ensures that the label text length sent does not exceed 245 
    characters. If the label text length exceeds 245 characters, then the
    additional text will be parsed and sent in additional messages.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch enhances the functionality of PSO59.
 
PSO59 retrieves data from the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) and has three 
parameters: PSOIEN (optional), PSOTXT (optional), and LIST (required).  
While PSOIEN and PSOTXT are both labeled as optional, PSO59 requires that 
either parameter be passed in or no data will be returned.  PSOIEN is the 
internal entry number (IEN) of a site, PSOTXT is a free text entry that 
works as a search parameter, and LIST is the subscript name used in the 
^TMP global.  This routine will now return field values for the NPI 
INSTITUTION field (#101) and NCPDP NUMBER field (#1008) from the 
OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59).
 
Please refer to DBIA 4827 for further description on PSO59.

In backdoor pharmacy, when placing a new order, renewing an existing
Order, or copying an order to a new order, if a patient is eligible for
COMBAT VET (CV), the default answer to the prompt "Was treatment related
to Combat" is currently presented as Null. This patch will change the
default answer, currently Null, to 'Yes'.
 
Note:
 
When finishing a pending order the current functionality related to the
CV question will remain the same, i.e., the default answer will be set to
either 'Yes' or 'No' depending on what is being marked by the provider.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The FY07 Q4 Enhancement Release includes the following PSO enhancements:
 
1. Internet Refill Automation and Reporting
   a. Internet Refill Automation Job
      Added a new Automate Internet Refill [PSO AUTO REFILL INITIALIZE]
      option to the Maintenance (Outpatient Pharmacy) [PSO MAINTENANCE]
      menu that allows the sites to schedule/un-schedule a background job
      to automatically process refill requests placed via the Internet. It
      requires the PSOAUTRF key and generates MailMan messages by division
      to holders of the PSOAUTRF key with details of Not-Filled refills,
      unsuccessful runs, count of refills processed successfully, etc.
 
      Note: The new PSOAUTRF security key is transported in this patch and
            should be assigned to the appropriate personnel to setup the
            above job.
 
 
      Example: If the patient is marked as dead, the following message is
               generated:
 
      Subj: ALBANY Internet Refills Not Processed List,  [#104161]
      08/10/07@09:12 11 lines
      From: POSTMASTER  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1  *New*
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      Internet Refills Not Processed Report for the ALBANY Division.
 
      The following refill requests were not processed:
 
      Patient: OPPATIENT,SEVEN   SSN: 0000
 
      Rx #: 100002461  (REF #1)  Qty: 2
      Drug: ASPIRIN 650MG SUPPOSITORIES
      Reason: Patient Died on AUG 10, 2007
 
 
   b. Added two new fields, PROCESS AUTO REFILLS FOR INPAT field (#2030)
      and PROCESS AUTO REFILLS FOR CNH field (#2035), to the OUTPATIENT
      SITE file (#59) to allow the sites to process/not to process refills
      for inpatients and CNH patients for the scheduled job defined in
      item 1.a above. It will process these refills only if the site has
      flagged these fields as YES.
 
      The Site Parameter Enter/Edit [PSO SITE PARAMETERS] option is also
      modified to include these two new fields.
 
   c. Added a new LOGIN DATE field (#11) to the PRESCRIPTION REFILL
      REQUEST file (#52.43) to capture the date and time the refill
      request was made.
 
   d. Added a new Internet Refill Report [PSO INTERNET REFILL REPORT]
      option, to the Output Reports [PSO OUTPUTS] menu that generates
      reports by division, detail, or summary of internet refills sorted
      by Patient, Date, or Result.
 
2. Modified the Barcode Batch Prescription Entry [PSO BATCH BARCODE] and
   Process Internet Refills [PSO INTERNET REFILLS] options to provide
   separate prompts to Allow refills for inpatient and Allow refills for
   Contract Nursing Home (CNH) instead of a single prompt that applies to
   both.
 
3. If the REGISTRATION package V. 5.3 patch DG*5.3*688 that introduces the
   COUNTRY field to the PATIENT file (#2) is installed, then:
  a. for Local Mail-outs with foreign addresses, the address information
     on the laser label mailing label is replaced with
     *** FOREIGN ADDRESS ***.
 
  b. In print from suspense, if the address is foreign and the routing is
     not "window", the label will not print nor will the prescription be
     sent to automated filling equipment. The fill will remain on suspense
     until it is pulled early, or the routing is changed to window, or the
     address is changed.
 
4. Added a new Queue CMOP Prescription [PSO RX QUEUE CMOP] option to the
   Suspense Functions [PSO PND] menu, Pharmacist Menu [PSO USER1] and
   Pharmacy Technician's Menu [PSO USER2] menu, to manually queue
   prescription to Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP).
 
5. The software is modified to check if the Provider has a DEA number in
   the DEA# field (#53.2) or a VA number in the VA# field (#53.3) of the
   NEW PERSON file (#200) and the YSCL AUTHORIZED key to order clozapine
   drug. Previously, the check was only for the DEA#. If the ordering
   provider does not have the DEA# or the VA#, the order cannot be placed
   and user will see the message 'Provider must have a DEA# or VA# to
   write prescriptions for clozapine'. Also, if the provider does not hold
   the YSCL AUTHORIZED key, the message 'Provider must hold YSCL
   AUTHORIZED key to write prescriptions for clozapine' is displayed.
 
   Note: The YSCL AUTHORIZED key was transported in the MENTAL HEALTH V.
         5.01 patch YS*5.01*90 and should be assigned to the appropriate
         provider to write prescriptions for clozapine.
 
6. The View Provider [PSO PROVIDER INQUIRE] option is modified to display
   the NPI field (#41.99) of the NEW PERSON file (#200).
 
7. Changes to the Patient Information (Profile) Screen
 a. The PATIENT STATUS field (#3) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) is
    added to the Patient Information screen. It will be displayed after
    the patient's eligibility.
 
    Example:
 
    Patient Information        Aug 10, 2007@10:04:09       Page: 1 of 2
    OPPATIENT,SEVEN

    DD  Detailed Allergy/ADR List           EX  Exit Patient List
    Select Action: Next Screen//
 
 b. Change the existing 'PHONE:' label to 'HOME PHONE:', and also display
    the PHONE NUMBER [CELLULAR] field (#.134) and the PHONE NUMBER [WORK]
    field (#.132) of the PATIENT file (#2). The work and cell phone
    fields can be maintained via the PATIENT UPDATE (PU) action and the
    Update Patient Record [PSO PAT] option.
 
8. Added a new hidden ListMan 'CM' action to the Medication Profile called
   Manual Queue to CMOP [PSO LM QUEUE TO CMOP] to the PSO HIDDEN ACTIONS
   #2 PROTOCOL, to manually queue selected prescriptions to CMOP.
 
9. Added a new column showing the B/D/F (Bad Address Indicator/ Do Not
   Mail/ Foreign Address) to the Log of Suspended Rx's by Day (this
   Division) [PSO PNDLOG] option.
 
10. Modified Bad Address Suspended List [PSO BAI SUSPENDED] option to
    include the prompt either B/D/F or 'ALL' in the unprinted suspended
    prescriptions report.
 
 
MISCELLANEOUS FIXES:
-------------------
 
1. With the release of PSO*7*260, a line of code was missing from the
   View Prescription [PSO VIEW] option that displays Dosage, Verb,
   Dispense Unit, Noun, Route, and Schedule. This patch restores this
   functionality.
 
2. The field description of the REFILL INACTIVE DRUG RXS field (#.111) of
   the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) has a typo. It is corrected to
   'prescription'.

This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans
Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic
pharmacy (ePharmacy) system.  
 
This patch modifies the Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) V. 7.0 application in the
following areas:
 
1.  For the Reject Information screen under the Third Party Payer 
Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] option, the hidden action PL 
for Print List is changed to PT for consistency with other Outpatient 
Pharmacy options.  
 
2.  The ePharmacy Medication Profile (View Only) [PSO PMP] option is 
changed to display discontinued prescriptions that do not have a cancel 
date defined.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Problems have been reported with the expiration date of prescriptions.
In some cases the date is not present and other cases have a wrong date.
Furthermore, most of the prescriptions with such problem are not in sync
with Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 3.0 and/or Health 
Data Repository (HDR) in regards to their status. This patch will 
identify 
and report a tally of how many prescriptions have such problem. A 
follow-up
patch (PSO*7*293) will subsequently be released to fix these 
prescriptions.
  
The count of prescriptions with this problem will be broken down into five
different groups:
 
GROUP 1: Prescriptions with a null expiration date.
   
GROUP 2: Expired prescriptions that are active in CPRS or with an 
         expiration date greater than 366 days.
 
GROUP 3: Prescriptions past their expiration date that are active in
         Outpatient Pharmacy.
 
GROUP 4: Deleted prescriptions. These prescriptions don't necessarily
         have a problem, however they will be resend to HDR.
 
OTHER  : Prescriptions with database inconsistencies, such as NO PATIENT,
         NO DRUG or NO ISSUE DATE are being counted for informational 
         purpose only.
 
The process to count these prescriptions will start right after the patch
is installed. If it is necessary to stop, restart the job or to know the
status of the job, run the following command in programmer mode:

HD214867 - Renewed orders remaining active
 
 
PSI-06-177 - RENEWED ORDERS REMAINING ACTIVE
(Note: Other scenarios related to renewed orders are being corrected in
patch PSO*7*257).
 
1. If expiring or discontinuing a prescription that also has a pending
renewal, the "renewed from" CPRS order's status is changed to expired or
discontinued instead of staying as "renewed".
 
2. If cancel a pending renewal for a previously expired (or 
discontinued) prescription that had been renewed after expired, the 
"renewed from" CPRS order should go back to "expired" (or "discontinued")
instead of remaining as "renewed".
 
RESOLUTION:
-----------
1. PSOHLSN1 - If  expiring or discontinuing a prescription that also has a
pending renewal, keep the "renewed from" CPRS order's status as "renewed".
 
2. PSOHLSN: - If cancel a pending renewal for a previously expired (or 
discontinued) prescription that had been renewed after expired (or 
discontinued), set CPRS order's status back to expired (or discontinued).

This patch addresses PSI-06-177 - MED STATUS RENEWED PAST STOP DATE
 
This patch will modify the Manual Auto Expire Rxs [PSO MANUAL AUTO EXPIRE]
option and the Expire Prescriptions [PSO EXPIRE PRESCRIPTIONS] option to
check for more values of the STATUS field (#5) in the ORDER file (#100) in
the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) before deciding whether to 
send the expire transaction. Before, the expire transaction was sent if 
the STATUS field was "ACTIVE". This patch checks for the CPRS status not
being any of the following and if not, will send the expire transaction:
  DISCONTINUED
  CANCELLED
  DISCONTINUED/EDIT
  EXPIRED
 
This patch corrects an additional issue with mis-calculating the default 
value for the start date prompt for the Manual Auto Expire Rxs [PSO MANUAL
AUTO EXPIRE] option. 
 
This patch fixes an error received when running the Compile AMIS Data
(NIGHT JOB) [PSO AMIS COMPILE].  When the Expire Prescriptions [PSO EXPIRE
PRESCRIPTIONS] or Manual Auto Expire Rxs [PSO MANUAL AUTO EXPIRE] process
runs at the same time the CMOP transmission is running bad data can be
created.  The Expire Prescriptions and Manual Auto Expire Rxs processes
will delete the last refill data if the refill does not have a label
printed (CMOP fills do not have this) and does not have a Release
Date/Time which they do not if CMOP has not yet released the refill.  The
refill node is deleted and then when CMOP does release the refill it only
sets the Released Date/Time and Dispensed Date so this will be the only
data set for the refill which causes the error in the AMIS compile.
 
==================
** IMPORTANT!! **:
================== 
Please check that the nightly expire - PSO EXPIRE PRESCRIPTIONS job is
tasked to run on a 24 hour rescheduling frequency. This is very important,
as it relates to the HDR, because this job sets the status of a
prescription to Expired the day after the prescription expiration date,
and also updates CPRS and the HDR with this information. If this job is
not running, prescriptions could show as Active in the HDR, when the
expiration date is in the past.
 
The job in TaskMan would look something like this:

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;281 SEQ #253</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2008-05-26 16:13:54</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans 
Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic 
pharmacy (ePharmacy) system that supports the Electronic Claims 
Management Engine (ECME).  It is the first of four stand alone patches
that will fulfill the requirements of ePharmcy/ECME Enhancements Phase 4 
Iteration II.  It modifies the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 application as
described below:
 
 
1.  EPHARMACY MEDICATION PROFILE (VIEW ONLY) [PSO PMP] option has been
modified in the following manner:
 
    a.  Patients flagged with the Bad Address indicator will display the
        same warning messages as PATIENT PRESCRIPTION PROCESSING [PSO LM
        BACKDOOR ORDERS] option. If the user holds the PSO ADDRESS UPDATE
        key, a prompt to update the address/phone will be displayed.
 
    b.  The PU - Patient Record Update action has been added to the
        Patient Medication Profile screen.  To achieve this, the 
        PU action was added to the PATIENT MEDICATION PROFILE protocol
        menu [PSO PMP MENU].
 
        The following actions have been removed from the Patient 
        Medication Profile screen by removing them from the PATIENT
        MEDICATION PROFILE protocol menu [PSO PMP MENU]:
 
             DR         Sort By Drug
             ID         Sort By Issue Date
             LF         Sort By Last Fill Date
             RX         Sort By Prescription
 
    c.  The above removed actions have been added to the hidden actions
        menu by adding them to the ePharmacy Medication Profile Hidden 
        Actions [PSO PMP HIDDEN ACTIONS MENU] protocol.
 
    d.  The REJ View Reject action was added to the hidden menu on the Rx
        View screen.  The ePharmacy Hidden Actions Menu #2 [PSO PMP HIDDEN
        ACTIONS MENU #2] protocol was added to contain this new action,
        and this protocol is also used by the VIEW PRESCRIPTION option
        [PSO VIEW].
 
 
2.  The default answer of (I)gnore on the Reject Processing Screen has 
been changed to (Q)uit which automatically sends the claim rejection  
information to the Pharmacy Reject Worklist (i.e. re-instate discontinued 
order, unhold, refill, PP - pull early from suspense, edit that doesn't 
create a new order, and release with NDC edits). Due to conflicting patch
release schedules and shared routines with another Pharmacy patch, the new
order, copy, edits that create new orders, and renewal functions will
remain with a default answer of (I)gnore for reject processing screens
displayed prior to label print. These functions will be updated in a
subsequent ePharmacy Iteration II patch when the conflict no longer
exists.
 
3.  The VIEW PRESCRIPTION [PSO VIEW] option has been modified to give 
comprehensive help text for the VIEW PRESCRIPTION prompt.  The REJ View
Reject action was added to the ePharmacy Hidden Actions Menu
# 2 [PSO PMP HIDDEN ACTIONS MENU # 2].
 
4.  The ECME LOG was recording the routing of WINDOW for all original 
fills and refills.  A modification was made to correctly state the route 
for each fill that is processed after this patch is installed.  The 
PATIENT PRESCRIPTION PROCESSING [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option,  VIEW
PRESCRIPTION [PSO VIEW] option, and EPHARMACY MEDICATION PROFILE (VIEW 
ONLY) [PSO PMP] option is affected by this change.
 
5.  The ECME Log entry that is stored when a prescription is printed
from suspense has been changed from stating ECME:SUSP LABEL PRINTED to 
ECME:PRINTED FROM SUSPENSE.  This change will affect fills processed 
after this patch has been installed.  
 
6.  A change was made to allow the user to edit Dispensed As Written (DAW)
and National Drug Code (NDC) fields for expired and discontinued ePharmacy
prescriptions and refills.
 
7.  A modification was made to store the last used NDC for payable 
prescriptions that were pulled early from suspense.  This change affects
the PULL EARLY FROM SUSPENSE [PSO PNDRX] option and the PP Pull RX action
of the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option.
 
8.  A post intall routine (PSO260PI) from PSO*7.0*260 will be deleted 
with this patch.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
This patch corrects the following issues:
 
1. In the Delete a Prescription [PSO RXDL] option:
  a. If entering a prescription number that has previously been deleted 
and then pressing enter when prompted for a prescription again, an
undefined error occurs. (HD212690)
  b. If enter a character like ! at the prescription prompt, 2 question
marks are displayed because it is an invalid prescription. Then at the
next prompt for prescription, if an @ is entered, an undefined error 
occurs. (HD210092)
 
2. In the Prescription Cost Update [PSO RXCOST UPDATE] option, unless the 
original fill date for the prescription is included in the requested date 
range, the cost will not be updated in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) for
any of the fills. If the user selects to update refills and partials 
also, it updates all fills on the prescription regardless of whether 
they were within the requested date range. This patch makes a correction
to update fills only within the requested range without having to 
include the original fill in that range. If the user selects an end fill
date of today or in the future, this option will update the cost for all
existing and suspended fills that have a fill date in the future. 
(HD213587)
 
3. Older data in the Health Data Repository (HDR) could contain
non-numeric data in the quantity field for some prescriptions. The data
definition was changed in patch PSO*7*29 to no longer allow alpha
characters. The following was added to the technical description for
  1. QTY field (#7) in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52)
  2. QTY field (#1) in the PRESCRIPTION file REFILL multiple (#52.1)
  3. QTY field (#.04) in the PRESCRIPTION file PARTIAL multiple (#52.2)
 
 NOTE: QTY values that were on file prior to patch PSO*7*29 (released
 2/17/00) may contain alpha characters.

This patch performs the actual prescription clean up for prescriptions 
identified by patch PSO*7*283. Patch PSO*7*283 performed a tally, while 
this patch will correct the prescriptions with the expiration date and/or
status issues. In some cases the date is not present and other cases have 
a 
wrong date. Furthermore, most of the prescriptions with such problems are
not in sync with Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 3.0 and/or
Health Data Repository (HDR) in regards to their status. This patch makes
the correction to the expiration date of these prescriptions and send 
messages to CPRS and HDR so these two applications can update the 
corresponding order with the expired status on their systems. This patch
will address these problems. Below is a detailed description on this
process:
 
Expiration post-install job clean-up flow:
------------------------------------------
In order to explain the process to clean up these prescriptions the
following terms will be mentioned below:
 
CUTOFF DATE: 
-----------
This is the date last processed by the Auto Expiration Background Job.
This background job is supposed to be run nightly by every site. This date
is stored in the field DATE AUTO-EXPIRE COMPLETED (#49.95) in PHARMACY
SYSTEM file (#59.7) and it was introduced by the patch PSS*1*128 and it 
should be populated with a valid date in all site. In case this field is
null, the post-install routine in this patch will set it to to the date
corresponding to 2 days in the past from this patch installation date. For
example, if the patch is installed on March 5, 2008 and the field is null,
it will be set to March 3, 2008 (in the correct Fileman date format).
 
CALCULATED EXPIRATION DATE:
--------------------------
The expiration date for prescription with a null expiration date is
calculated by the following formula:
  
 For Rx with no refills: 
 
      NUMBER OF DAYS SUPPLY FROM Rx ISSUE DATE (MININUM: 30 DAYS)
 
 Rx with 1 or more refills: 
  
      Non-controlled Substances: 
Rx ISSUE DATE + 366 DAYS    
 
      Controlled Substances    : Rx ISSUE DATE + 184 DAYS        
 
CPRS 'NON-ACTIVE' STATUS:
------------------------
The following CPRS statuses: DISCONTINUED, EXPIRED, DISCONTINUED/EDIT and 
CANCELLED are considered 'NON-ACTIVE' by Pharmacy in this clean up 
process.
This means that Pharmacy will not send a prescription expiration event to 
CPRS if the CPRS order status is set to one of these.
 
PHARMACY 'NON-ACTIVE' STATUS:
---------------------------
The following Pharmacy statuses: EXPIRED, DISCONTINUED, DELETED, 
DISCONTINUED BY PROVIDER, DISCONTINUED (EDIT) are considered 'NON-ACTIVE'
by Pharmacy in this clean up process.
  
 
CLEAN UP PROCESS DESCRIPTION:
---------------------------- 
Prescriptions with an expiration date problem are being analyzed and
cleaned up differently, depending on which GROUP
 below they fall under:
  
  
GROUP 1:
-------
Prescriptions with a null expiration date for patients.
  
  a) Set the CALCULATED EXPIRATION DATE in the EXPIRATION DATE
     field (#26) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
  b) If the expiration date is on or before the CUTOFF DATE 
     b1) If the prescription is not already in a Pharmacy 'NON-ACTIVE'
         status, set the STATUS field (#100) in the PRESCRIPTION
         file (#52) to EXPIRED.
     b2) Update CPRS*
     b3) Update HDR
  c) If the expiration date is past the CUTOFF DATE
     c1) Update HDR
   
GROUP 2:
-------
Expired prescriptions for patients.
 
  a) If the prescription expiration date is GREATER than 366 days
     a1) A new expiration date will be calculated and set in the 
         EXPIRATION DATE field (#26) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
     a2) Update CPRS*
     a3) Update HDR
  b) If the prescription expiration date is LESS than 366 days
     b1) Update CPRS*
     b2) Update HDR (if CPRS is updated)
 
GROUP 3:
-------
Prescriptions with an expiration date on or before the CUTOFF DATE with
a Pharmacy 'ACTIVE' status
  
  a) Set the STATUS field (#100) in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) to 
     EXPIRED.
  b) If the CPRS order status is 'ACTIVE'
     b1) Update CPRS*
     b2) Update HDR (if CPRS is updated).
  c) If the CPRS order status is 'NON-ACTIVE' 
     c1) Update HDR
  
   NOTE: If the prescription does not have a corresponding CPRS Order
         Number, the counter for this specific problem will be 
         incremented. However, the HDR will not be updated. HDR will
         perform their own clean up for these cases.
 
GROUP 4:
-------
Deleted prescriptions for patients.
 
  a) Update HDR
 
 
  * CPRS will only be updated if the prescription contains the 
    corresponding CPRS Order Number for the prescription being cleaned
    up. Furthermore, CPRS will not be updated if the corresponding 
    CPRS order is on a 'NON-ACTIVE' status.
 
 
The clean up process will start right after the patch is installed. If 
it is necessary to stop, restart the job or to know the status of the
job, do the following:

Besides the clean up process, this patch introduces a change intended to
address a sporadic scenario where a prescription does not contain a 
pointer to the corresponding CPRS order # and it goes through a status
change (e.g. from Active to Expired). Currently, such status change event
is not communicated to HDR. This patch contains a fix to notify HDR of
the status change event for such prescriptions.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;294 SEQ #257</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2008-07-22 08:09:29</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch introduces the components necessary to build four tools
useful for medication reconciliation.
 
Tool 1 is a Medication Reconciliation Profile health summary component.
This report creates an alphabetical list of outpatient prescriptions,
unit dose medications, documented non-VA medications, and remote VA
medications.  This summary can be used at transition points in a patient's
care, (admission, discharge, etc.) to identify medications that need to
be continued, new items to be ordered, old items to be discontinued, or
orders that need to be changed.
 
Tool 2 is a Medication Chart health summary component.  This report
provides a grid-formatted list of active and pending medications suitable
for giving to a patient at a clinic visit or upon discharge from the hospital.
 
Tool 3 is a TIU data object provided as an alternative to the Medication
Chart health summary process.  The unique aspect of this object is that
the list, generated for the patient,includes recently expired
medications but not recently discontinued medications.
 
Tool 4 is a series of TIU data objects and health summary components that
retrieve remote active medications and remote allergy/ADR data.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The Enrollment VistA Changes (EVC) project is being undertaken to support
technology and business changes that are occurring with the implementation
of the Health Eligibility Center (HEC) Enrollment System Redesign (ESR)
project. Some modified and new business functionality is being included in
the new system and corresponding changes are necessary in VistA for
preliminary determination of veterans Enrollment and Eligibility status.
The EVC project has been rolled out in three phases. This release
represents the third and last phase called EVC Release 2.
 
This patch provides the functionality changes to determine, process and
disseminate the newly added Environmental Indicator (EI) called Project
112/SHAD Exposure (a.k.a SHAD), where applicable.
 
This patch also changed the EI, "Environmental Contaminant" to read
as "Southwest Asia Conditions".
 
 1. For the following options, when creating a new order, renewing an
    existing order, copying an existing order to a new order, or editing
    an existing order that results in a new order, the copay status of the
    prescription needs to be determined for billing purposes.
 
    a. Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
    b. Barcode Batch Prescription Entry [PSO BATCH BARCODE]
    c. Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH]
 
   If a patient is found eligible for SHAD then the prompt
   "Was treatment related to PROJ 112/SHAD?" will be presented to the
   pharmacist.
 
   A "YES" or "NO" response will be stored in the new fields, PROJ
   112/SHAD field (#122.01) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and in the PROJ
   112/SHAD field (#8) of the ICD DIAGNOSIS sub-file (#52.052311) of the
   PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
 
 2. The Integration Control Registration (ICR) #2534, provides
    Computerized Patient Record System V. 3.0 (CPRS) with all the eligible
    EI questions that will be prompted during the pharmacy order entry
    process. This ICR is modified to include the SHAD prompt.
 
 3. When a verbal or telephone order is placed in backdoor pharmacy, it
    requires an electronic signature from the provider. During the
    signature entry process in CPRS, the provider may update the SC, EI,
    or the ICD diagnosis information. This updated information is passed
    back to pharmacy via the ICR #4666, which is modified to include the
    SHAD changes.
 
 4. The PENDING OUTPATIENT ORDERS file (#52.41) that stores the pharmacy
    orders entered via CPRS is modified to include the provider's response
    to the SHAD question. The provider's response will be stored in the
    new fields, PROJ 112/SHAD field (#110.2) of the PENDING OUTPATIENT
    ORDERS file (#52.41) and the PROJ 112/SHAD field (#8) of the DIAGNOSIS
    sub-file (#52.41311) of the PENDING OUTPATIENT ORDERS file (#52.41).
 
 5. During the release of a prescription, if the SHAD question applies and
    is unanswered, the MailMan message that is sent to the finishing
    pharmacist, ordering provider, and holders of the PSO COPAY key, to
    get answers to the EI questions will have the SHAD question if
    applicable.
 
 6. The Reset Copay Status/Cancel Charges [PSOCP RESET COPAY STATUS]
    option is modified to include the SHAD question wherever applicable.
 
 7. During label printing, if the prescription is flagged as SHAD then the
    text "NO COPAY" will be printed in the label.
 
Unrelated to the Enrollment VistA Changes (EVC) features, this patch also
provides the following changes to support CPRS v27.
 
 a. To add the proper escape sequences to the standard HEALTH LEVEL
    SEVEN (HL7) encoding characters to messages sent to CPRS / remove
    escape sequences received from CPRS and replace them with standard HL7
    encoding characters. This will help avoid errors that can occur if
    special delimiting characters are encountered during parsing of the
    HL7 messages.
 
 b. Integration Control Registration (ICR) #2400, will be modified to
    provide new sorting sequences of the patient medication profile that
    is viewed under the CPRS-Meds Tab including the Non-VA medications.
 
    VIEW 0 or null - This provides the medication list as it was prior to
             GUI 27 so that other applications calling this API will not
             see any changes.
    VIEW 1 - This provides the medication list sorted by prescription
             Status Group and Stop Date/Expiration Date. Following is the
             order:
            Pending group
              Non-Verified
              Pending
            Active group:
              Active
              Hold
              Suspended (Active/Susp)
              Provider Hold
            Expired group
              Expired
            Discontinued/Deleted group
              Discontinued by Provider
              Discontinued (Edit)
 
    VIEW 2 - This provides the medication list sorted by prescription
             Status Group, Status, and Drug Name.
            Active group:
              Active
              Hold
            Pending group
              Non-Verified
              Pending
            Discontinued
              Discontinued by Provider
              Discontinued (Edit)
 
    VIEW 3 - This provides the medication list sorted by Drug Name,
           active/suspended and Stop Date/Expiration Date.
 
 c. Flag/Un-Flag functionality (PSI-06-041)
    It was requested in the Remedy ticket #133716 that the flagging
    capability that is available in CPRS be made available for
    Outpatient Pharmacy use. This patch provides the flagging
    functionality for Pending orders only.
 
 d. As per the E3R numbers 19973 and 19876, to improve communication
    between the provider and the pharmacist, Outpatient Pharmacy will now
    send the actual comments made by the pharmacist to CPRS when a
    prescription is put on Hold, Discontinued, and Returned to Stock
    replacing the generic "per pharmacy request" text.
 
 e. When the DC-Discontinue ListMan option is used to discontinue a
    pending "renewal" order, the software will now check for an active
    prescription for the same drug. If found it will prompt the following:
    "There is an active Rx for this pending order, Discontinue both
    (Y/N)".
    This will provide the user with the option to discontinue both pending
    and the active order.
 
 f. A problem was reported in one of the error messages displayed on CPRS
    side when a provider tries to discontinue an Outpatient Pharmacy
    order from the Orders Tab and that order for some reason is
    not found in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52). The solution provided is to
    replace the error message "Unable to locate order" with "Invalid
    Pharmacy order number" to be in consistent with the Inpatient
    Medications V. 5.0 error messages.
 
 g. At the request of CPRS active calls to obsolete routine OR3CONV have
    been removed from Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0.
 
 h. When finishing a pending order placed in CPRS, it was reported that
    the patient instructions sent across to CPRS was getting truncated.
    This patch fixes the problem.
 
 i. PSI-07-057 - Potential of inappropriate or misleading provider
    comments to be automatically included on new medication orders.
    To fix this problem CPRS is dropping (will not carry over) the
    original provider comments during renewals of Outpatient Pharmacy
    medications.
    To follow suit with CPRS, Outpatient Pharmacy is also dropping the
    original provider comments from all backdoor renewals.

This patch is one of four patches that enhance the ePharmacy software to 
provide the framework to support Tricare and Active Duty outpatient
pharmacy billing.  The Tricare/Active Duty portions of this software
enhancement will not be active until a future patch is released.  The
release of the additional patch is pending Central Business Office (CBO)
contracting with the Tricare Fiscal Intermediary.
 
Below is a list of all the applications involved in this project along 
with their associated patch number:
 
       APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
     --------------------------------------------------------------
 1.  CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMCY (CMOP) V. 2.0   PSX*2*66
 2.  OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*287
 3.  ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*6
 4.  INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*383
 
All four patches are being released separately with a requirement that 
they be installed in the order outlined above.  There are no other 
dependencies between these patches, except that Tricare/Active Duty 
billing will not be supported by ePharmacy until all 4 patches are 
installed.
 
All sites should install these patches regardless of whether or not they 
have been activated for ePharmacy by the CBO or are providing outpatient
pharmacy services to Tricare or Active Duty patients.  After the
installation of these patches, the activation status of the site will not
be impacted.  As before, activation of the ePharmacy product will require
instructions provided by the CBO, and sites are not to activate ePharmacy
unless instructed specifically by the CBO.  Also, sites should not start
to provide outpatient pharmacy services to Tricare patients without
discussions with the CBO.
 
This patch modifies the Outpatient Pharmacy v7.0 application as described
below.  The modifications labeled dormant in the software and will remain
inactive until the future Tricare patch is released.
 
1.  (Dormant) - Prescriptions where the patient is Tricare eligible will
be submitted to ECME for third party insurance processing in the same
manner as all other insurance types.  Tricare eligibility is determined by
Integrated Billing (IB). An indicator is returned to Outpatient Pharmacy
PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and REFILL multiple (#52.1) to be stored in the
new BILLING ELIGIBILITY INDICATOR field (#85).  Because this is a set of
codes field, the internal value will be T, V or C. These values will be
displayed respectively to the user as TRICARE, VETERAN, or CHAMPVA. Note
that CHAMPVA will not be addressed in this patch.  Prescriptions with only
a 'VETERAN' eligibility flag are what is currently processed through ECME.
 
2.  (Dormant) - When a Tricare prescription has a third party rejection,
the same reject notification screen will be displayed to the user as is
currently done for the Veteran eligibility.  Tricare Rejections will be
stored in the same manner as Drug Utilization Review (DUR) and
Refill-too-soon (RTS) prescription reject are currently stored.
 
The following exceptions will apply for Tricare prescriptions:
 
    A.  All Tricare rejections will be denoted as Tricare in the REJECT 
        Information header on the Reject Information screen.
 
    B.  Where DUR or RTS are one of the reject codes, the user will be
        able to select from (D)iscontinue the prescription, submit 
        (O)verride codes, or (Q)uit which sends the rejection to the Third
        Party Payer Rejects - Worklist.  Tricare rejection may not be
        (I)gnored.
 
    C.  For prescription rejections that have non-DUR/RTS rejects, the
        user will be able to select from (D)iscontinue the prescription or
        (Q)uit which sends it to the Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist.
 
    D.  For non-billable Tricare prescriptions, an abbreviated version of
        the reject notification screen will be displayed.  Because the
        prescriptions is non-billable, the insurance and ECME information
        that's currently provided for DUR/RTS rejects will not be
        displayed (i.e. insurance, group name, group #, ECME #, contact,
        cardholder ID).  In this case, the user will only be able to
        (D)iscontinue the prescription due to the business rule that OP
        cannot fill Tricare prescriptions that are non-billable.
 
    E.  Labels will not print for discontinued Tricare prescriptions.
        Reprint labels will not be allowed to be printed for Tricare
        rejected prescriptions.  The reject notification screen will be
        displayed during reprint in the same manner as non-Tricare
        prescription currently are displayed with the exception of the
        available actions listed above for Tricare prescriptions.
 
    F.  Suspended prescriptions will remain on suspense when a reject
        occurs, when the Rx is non-billable, or when the third party claim
        remains in an 'IN PROGRESS' status in ECME.  Labels will not
        print.  Once the reject is resolved, the user may pull the Rx 
        early from suspense or wait for the next scheduled print from
        suspense runs at which time labels will print accordingly. This
        includes CMOP and local suspense.
 
    G.  Rejected Tricare prescription may not have a partial fill ordered 
        until the reject is resolved.
 
    H.  When the  Pull Early from Suspense [PSO PNDRX] option is used, 
        Tricare prescriptions will be processed in the foreground and
        rejections will be displayed for user intervention.
 
 
3.  (Dormant except for item C.) - The Third Party Payer Rejects -
Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] option and the Third Party Payer Rejects -
View/Process [PSO REJECTS VIEW/PROCESS] options have been modified in the
following manner:
 
     A. Non-DUR/RTS Tricare rejections will be segregated at the end of
        the displayed information. They will be denoted with a "TRICARE -
        Non-DUR/RTS" header.  This header will remain regardless of
        whether the GI - Group by Insurance action is toggled on or off.  
        The Tricare section will sort in the same manner as the main sort
        for non-Tricare prescriptions (i.e. by Rx, drug, patient, etc.).
  
     B. Tricare DUR/RTS rejects will be displayed with all other DUR/RTS
        rejects.  When GI - Group by Insurance action is toggled on, the
        header "TRICARE" will be displayed, and this "TRICARE" section
        will sort alphabetically within the other insurances.  This
        Tricare section is separate from the Non-DUR/RTS section that
        displays at the end of the listing.  When GI is toggled off, these
        rejects will sorted in the same section as all other DUR/RTS
        rejects.
 
     C. (Not dormant) - The new TRI - Show/Hide Tricare toggle action has
        been added to the hidden menu on the Insurance Rejects screen.  
        When toggled to Show, Tricare Non-DUR/RTS reject will be
        automatically displayed at the end of the listing.  Toggling the
        TRI action to Hide will remove them from the screen.
 
     D. The Reject Information screen has been modified to display TRICARE
        in the header for the Reject Information section.  For DUR/RTS
        Tricare rejects, the IGN - Ignore Reject action will be shown but
        will not be selectable. For Non-DUR/RTS Tricare rejects, the FIL -
        Fill Rx action will be displayed. If the prescription is payable,
        the user will be allowed to fill the prescription and print the
        label.  If not payable, a message will be displayed stating that
        the prescription must have a payable status to be filled.
 
     E. For rejects that remain in suspense, the user will be allowed to
        process the rejection as indicated above, however no labels will
        be printed until the prescription is pulled early or printed from
        suspense.  Upon resolving the reject, the user will be notified
        of this information.  CMOP prescriptions will function in the same
        manner.
 
4.  In preparation for a future ePharmacy patch the following fields are 
being added to PRESCRIPTION file (#52) for original fills and refills:
DATE NDC VALIDATED field (#83) and NDC VALIDATED BY field (#84).  
 
5.  For ePharmacy prescriptions, the price per dispense unit for the
NDC will be saved in PRESCRIPTION file (#52).  For original fills, the  
UNIT PRICE OF DRUG field (#17) will be updated.  For refills, the CURRENT
UNIT PRICE OF DRUG field (#1.2) of REFILL multiple (#52.1) will be
updated. If the NDC chosen is the default NDC, the value stored will be
taken from PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field (#16) of DRUG file (#50).  If the
NDC selected is a synonym, the PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field (#404) of
SYNONYM multiple (#9) of DRUG file (#50) will be saved. In the case of
CMOP fills, only the default NDC price will be stored which is taken from
PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field (#16) of DRUG file (#50).
 
6.  (Dormant) - If ECME's status on the claim remains in an "In Progress"
state past the processing time out during finish of the prescription,
Tricare prescriptions will not be allowed to be filled and must be
discontinued.
 
7.  (Dormant) - If the pharmacy is active for ePharmacy processing but the
insurance plan is not linked or not active, Tricare prescription will be
allowed to be filled normally.  The phrase "Inactive ECME Tricare" will be
displayed during Finish.

1. After release of an ePharmacy Phase 4 patch (PSO*7*287), it was found
that the PSOORED6 routine was erring or causing a DIE error due to a
variable being killed in a called routine.  This patch corrects this
error.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans 
Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic 
pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.
 
All sites should install this patches regardless of whether or not they 
have been activated for ePharmacy by the Central Business Office (CBO).  
After the installation of these patches, the activation status of the 
site will not be impacted.  As before, activation of the ePharmacy 
product will require instructions provided by the CBO.  Sites are not to 
activate unless instructed specifically by the CBO.
 
This patch is being released along with PSS*1*139 and IB*2*405.  These
patches can be installed in any order but the full functionality 
for Nutritional Supplement additions contained within these patches will
not be available until all 3 patches are installed.
 
This patch modifies the Outpatient Pharmacy v7.0 application as described
below:
    
1.  Modifications to change the default answer of (I)gnore on the Reject 
Processing Screen to (Q)uit which automatically sends the claim rejection 
information to the Pharmacy Reject Worklist for new orders, copies, edits 
that create new orders, and renewal functions.  This patch, PSO*7*303,  
includes the modifications for these functions.
 
2.  Additional software to handle the new "N  for Nutritional Supplement
DEA special handling code added in patch PSS*1*139.  This new "N" code
will be treated the same as supply items and investigational drugs in
Outpatient Pharmacy.  Copay will not be charged, and third party billing 
for these type drugs will only occur when the drug is also marked with 
"E" for Electronically Billable.  When the drug is not defined to be 
electronically billable, the ECME Log will reflect drug not billable.  
For prescriptions where the eligibility changed since the last refill, a 
"PRESCRIPTION QUESTIONS REVIEW NEEDED" MailMan message is sent.  The last 
paragraph of this message will be changed to include nutritional drugs:
 
     Supply, nutritional and investigational drugs are not charged a VA
     copay but could be reimbursable by third party insurance.
 
3.  For the ePharmacy Medication Profile (VIEW ONLY) [PSO PMP] option,
flagged pending orders will be notated on the medication profile screen by
highlighting the sequence number shown on the left side of the screen.  
Note that the "Flagged by..." information shown once the prescription is
selected is already present with the PSO*7*225 release.
 
4.  For Tricare Reversal/Resubmit actions sent to ECME with NDC changes,
the text for the ECME activity log was too large to fit in the field
without being truncated.  The log entry text "Reversal/Re-submit sent"
has been abbreviated to "Rev/Resubmit" to ensure the entire NDC is 
viewable in the log entry.

The FY08 Q4 Enhancement Release includes the following enhancements.
 
1. Automate Computerized Patient Record System V. 1.0 (CPRS) Refill
   Processing.
2. Display of both the Fill Date and the Release Date.
3. Duplicate Drugs Message Enhancements.
4. Notice of Privacy Practice Reminder on Laser Labels.
 
***** NOTE TO SITES USING AUTOMATED FILLING EQUIPMENT *****
This patch adds a new NTE8 segment that has the VA Notice of Privacy
Practices, IB 10-163 narrative to the content of the laser labels print
stream.  If you are using automated dispensing equipment that relies on
the data stream sent to the laser labels port, you have to contact your
vendor to make adjustments to the trailer page as defined in item #4
below.
 
1. Automate CPRS Refill Processing
==================================
This patch provides functionality to automatically process refills placed
by the provider via CPRS.  A new system parameter, AUTOMATE CPRS REFILLS
field (#40.16), has been added to the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7) by the
Pharmacy Data Management V. 1.0, patch PSS*1*137 to support this
functionality.
 
Please refer to patch PSS*1*137 for more details.
 
The auto refill process will occur only if the new AUTOMATE CPRS REFILLS
field (#40.16) of the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7) is set to YES and the
security key, PSOAUTRF, has been assigned to at least one user; otherwise
the current process will continue where the orders have to be finished
manually. Orders processed automatically will have the refill date
calculated by the refill process to the next possible fill date and the
routing will be set to Mail.
 
During the auto refill process, if the criteria for refilling fails, then
the order will not be processed but will be stored in the PENDING
OUTPATIENT ORDERS file (#52.41) for manual processing. Also, a MailMan
message, with the reason for not filling the auto refill, will be sent to
holders of the PSOAUTRF security key. This should be very rare since CPRS
will allow refills only if they are refillable.
 
2. Display of both the Fill Date and the Release Date
=====================================================
On the Patient Medication Profile screen, new functionality was
implemented to allow users to have the option of viewing either the FILL
DATE or the RELEASE DATE information. This is done by using a hidden
ListMan action called RDD to invoke the RELEASE DATE display and will
remain for that session. Using the RDD action again will display the FILL
DATE.
 
3. Duplicate Drugs Message Enhancements
=======================================
This enhancement is related to patient safety issue PSI-07-236 and remedy
ticket RT223633. When a duplicate drug message is displayed, the heading
"CMOP Status" is currently shown for CMOP drugs only. This heading is
being renamed to "Processing Status" and it will appear on every duplicate
drug message along with the release status.
 
4. Notice of Privacy Practice Reminder on Laser Labels
======================================================
When the labels are printed for a patient's prescriptions, the
following narrative will be printed on the trailer page in either English
or Spanish, depending on the patient's language preference.
 
The English version reads as follows.
 
  The VA Notice of Privacy Practices, IB 10-163, which outlines your
  privacy rights, is available online at http://www1.domain.ext/Health/ or you
  may obtain a copy by writing the VHA Privacy Office (19F2), 810 Vermont
  Avenue NW, Washington DC 20420.
 
The Spanish language translation for the Privacy Notification reads as
follows.
 
  La Notificacion relacionada con las Politicas de Privacidad del
  Departamento de Asuntos del Veterano, IB-10-163, contiene los
  detalles acerca de sus derechos de privacidad y esta disponible
  electronicamente en la siguiente direccion:

The last three patches (PSO*7*289, IB*2*384 and BPS*1*7) will be released 
in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build 
distribution BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 3.0.  Patches PSX*2*65 and PSS*1*131 will 
be released as stand-alone patches.  Since there is an implementation 
dependency between the multi-build distribution and the stand-alone 
patches, PSX*2*65 and PSS*1*131 must be installed prior to the 
installation of the multi-build.  For more specific instructions please 
refer to the installation steps provided in each of the patches.
 
This patch modifies the Outpatient Pharmacy v7.0 application as described
below:
 
1.  A modification was made to prevent users from entering a suspense date
that is greater than the fill date plus 90 days.  Dates where the fill
date plus 90 days is greater than the expiration date will not be allowed.
 
2.  Functionality to allow non-DUR/RTS reject to be placed on Third Party 
Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] option was added.  To 
accomplish this the following additions were made:
 
    a.  A new EPHARMACY SITE PARAMETERS FILE (#52.86) was added to store
        ePharmacy specific parameters by division.  Along with this file, 
        a new EPHARMACY SITE PARAMETERS [PSO ePHARM SITE PARAMATERS]
        option was added for entry/edit of parameters.  Regardless of any
        parameters defined in this new file, Refill-Too-Soon (RTS), Drug
        Utilization Review(DUR) and Tricare rejects will always be placed
        on the Pharmacy Reject Worklist.
 
        Sites will have the ability to select to allow all third party 
        rejects to pass to the the Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist
        which is also referred to as the Pharmacy Reject Worklist or they
        can choose to specify individual reject codes. Individual third
        party reject codes can be defined to be automatically placed on
        the worklist or defined to require OPECC intervention. If the site
        chooses to allow all rejects to be placed on the worklist,
        individual codes are overridden but not deleted from the file.
 
     b. For display of non-DUR/RTS rejects for the Third Party Payer
        Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] option, rejects passed
        via OPECC manual intervention will be denoted in the comment
        section of the Reject Information screen as:
 
        - JUN 09, 2008@14:04:18 - Transferred by OPECC. (user,name)
 
    
        Rejects passed automatically will be denoted in the comments 
        section of  the Reject Information Screen as 
 
       - JUN 09, 2008@16:00:09 - Automatically transferred due to override
         for reject code. (user,name)
 
        All rejects other than Refill-Too-Soon, DUR, and Tricare will be 
        displayed at the end of the listing under "OTHER REJECTS"
        header. The "OTHER REJECTS" header will be displayed regardless of
        whether the GI - Group Insurance action is toggled on or off.  
        
        Non-DUR/RTS rejections will be resolved with the existing
        functionality and will be resubmitted to ECME in the same manner
        as DUR/RTS rejections.
 
3.  A modification was made to not allow a claim to be reversed through 
ECME for an unreleased CMOP fill when the prescription/fill is 
discontinued. If the fill is either a CMOP released or Non-CMOP released 
fill the reversal will be performed.  Because the software already 
performs a reversal for unsuccessful/not dispensed claims, no changes are 
needed for reversing discontinued non-dispensed fills.  Also, no changes 
are needed when the NDC from CMOP differs from the NDC on the claim 
because this function is already performed by existing software.
 
4. New functionality was added to prevent prescriptions from being 
filled/sent to CMOP when a host processing error occurs when a claim is 
submitted through ECME. The host processing errors are identified by 
reject codes M6, M8, NN, and 99. The following conditions apply when this 
scenario occurs.
 
    a. The transmission of the Rx/fill will be delayed 1 day in hopes
       that the host processing issues will be resolved.
    b. An activity log entry will be defined to state the date/time 
       along with a comment stating that the Rx/fill was left in suspense
       hold due to a host processing error.
    c. This added functionality does not include the Pull Early from 
       Suspense function.
 
5. New functionality was added to the Print from Suspense File [PSO 
PNDLBL] option to prevent ePharmacy prescriptions from being pulled early
from suspense until 3/4 of the days supply of the Rx/fill has elapsed.  
The system will not hold a prescription for 3/4 days supply when:
 
    -   the previous fill was not ECME billable
    -   the Rx is flagged for SC or EI
    -   the DEA special Handling code is non billable (i.e. has M or 0 
             (zero) or  (I, S, N, and/or 9)) without and E.
    -   the Rx is a zero fill on a renewal
    -   the patient does not currently have insurance
 
6. A modification was made to PRESCRIPTION file (#52), REJECT INFO 
sub-file (#52.25), CLARIFICATION CODE field (#24). This was a set of codes
field.  It is now a pointer to file #9002313.25 (BPS NCPDP CLARIFICATION
CODE).  A post install routine will go through the reject info subfile and
convert the old set of code values to the appropriate new pointer values.
The post install will send a mail message to the person installing the
build which details the affected rejected prescriptions.  The 'Submit
Clarif. Code' protocol [PSO REJECT DISPLAY CLARIFICATION CODE] has been
altered to use the new pointer value.
 
7. The 'Edit NDC and DAW Code of Discontinued/Expired Prescriptions' 
functionality introduced in PSO*7.0*281 has been extended to also allow 
edits of prescriptions with a status of DISCONTINUED BY PROVIDER and 
DISCONTINUED (EDIT).
 
8. New functionality was added to create a nightly background mail 
message regarding open/unresolved rejects on the reject worklist.  The 
'Third Party Payer Rejects - Nightly Message' option [PSO REJECTS 
BACKGROUND MESSAGE] will be queued to run every 24 hours by the post 
install routine.  This option is intended to be a stand alone option and 
should not be placed on any menu.  The message will be delivered to the 
'PSO REJECTS BACKGROUND MESSAGE' mailgroup; this mailgroup should be 
populated with appropriate ePharmacy users to receive the information.  
Mail messages are generated for each division. Sites may alter EPHARMACY
SITE PARAMETERS file (#52.86) REJECT WORKLIST DAYS field (#4) for each 
division using the ePharmacy Site Parameters option [PSO EPHARM SITE 
PARAMETERS] of the ePharmacy Menu.  If no sites are defined in the 
EPHARMACY SITE PARAMETERS file (#52.86), no message will be generated.  
This parameter may be defined to be 1 to 30 days that an uncommented
reject can remain on the reject worklist without being included in the
nightly reject worklist alert mail message.  The following are the
criteria for a reject to be included in the mail message:
 
    a. The prescription is active, suspensed, expired, or on hold.
    b. The prescription is unreleased.
    c. The claim has been on the Reject Worklist for more days than the
       value in the REJECT WORKLIST DAYS field for the division.
    d. The claim has no comments added within the date range.
 
9. New functionality was added to allow NDC validation of third party
payable prescriptions by pharmacy technicians.  Current functionality
requires a pharmacist to perform this task.  In addition, for the
PRESCRIPTION file(#52) and the REFILL sub-file (#52.1), the DATE NDC
VALIDATED field (#83) and NDC VALIDATED BY field (#84) will be captured
when the NDC is validated for a prescription or refill; this validation
information will be displayed when prescriptions are released; if the NDCs
have not been validated, that information will be displayed instead.  The
'NDC Validation' option [PSO NDC VALIDATE] has been added to the ePharmacy
Menu for use by technicians.  The option will work as follows:
 
    a. The technician will be prompted to scan or enter a prescription 
       number.  An '^' may be entered to halt the option.
    b. The system will evaluate the Rx.  If the Rx NDC has already been 
       validated, the technician will be prompted if they wish to
       revalidate. If the answer is yes, the technician will be allowed to
       proceed.  If the answer is no, the technician will be returned to
       the select a prescription prompt.
    c. If the Rx is CMOP, external interface or released, the user will
       not be allowed to verify the Rx.
    d. The system will display information about the Rx, notate that the
       Rx has not been previously verified and will prompt for PRODUCT 
       NDC. A valid PRODUCT NDC must be entered for this prompt.  Valid
       PRODUCT NDC's are those defined for the drug in Drug file (#50) as
       an NDC of a synonym or the default NDC.
    e. The system will compare the Rx NDC to the PRODUCT NDC submitted on
       the ePharmacy claim.  If the NDCs do not match, the system will
       reverse and resubmit a third party claim with the new NDC and 
       store the new NDC on the fill.
    f. If the prescription is defined as TRICARE and is not payable, the 
       system will display an appropriate message and the technician will 
       be returned to the select a prescription prompt.
    g. If the prescription is defined as TRICARE and the reversed claim 
       returns not payable, the system will display an appropriate 
       message and the technician will be returned to the select a
       prescription prompt.
    h. Otherwise, the system will update the NDC validation fields for the
       Rx/Fill, and the technician will be returned to the select a
       prescription prompt.
 
10.  The RES - Resubmit Claim action was added to the Reject Information
(TRICARE) screen of the Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS
WORKLIST] option.
 
11.  The following functionality will work only if the REGISTRATION
package V.5.3 patch DG*5.3*688 that introduces the COUNTRY field to the
PATIENT file (#2) is installed:
 
   When using the Print from Suspense File [PSO PNDLBL] option, if the
   routing is MAIL and the address is Foreign, it will be treated just
   like the BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR or DO NOT MAIL order where:
 
   a. The prescription will not be sent to the automated filling equipment
      and/or to the label printer. The fill will remain on suspense until
      it is pulled early, the routing is changed to window, or the address
      is changed.
 
   b. For the first time attempt to print from suspense, an entry will be
      added to the activity log and a MailMan message will be generated to
      the user who queued the job to print from suspense and the members
      of the PSO EXTERNAL DISPENSE ALERTS mail group.
 
12.  When the NDC changes during auto-release of the prescription for CMOP
or OPAI fills, the fill date on the fill be updated to become the same as
the release date.  An entry will be made in the activity log for the fill 
to denote the changed date.

The following issues are addressed in this patch:
1. This patch addresses a request which support the Pharmacy Benefits
Management (PBM) Extracts Enhancement #3 project. In order to allow the
retransmission of only those patients who have had demographic updates,
Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0, Inpatient Medications V. 5.0, Registration
V. 5.3 and Pharmacy Data Management V. 1.0 were modified to build an entry
for re-transmission in PBM PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS File #59.9.
 
When the FIRST SERVICE DATE field (#.07) in the PHARMACY PATIENT file #55
is updated for a patient, an entry is queued for retransmission.
 
 
2. During internal testing, it was discovered that the FIRST SERVICE DATE
field (#.07) and the ACTUAL/HISTORICAL FLAG field (#.08) were not being
set appropriately when the user exited out of label print. This patch
corrects this problem.

The FY09 Q3 Enhancement Release includes the following.
 
1. PSI-07-134 (PSPO #771) - Remedy Ticket # HD200301/HD217962
 
In Outpatient Pharmacy during order entry when there is no allergy
assessment on file for a patient, the user will be given the ability to
duplicate the allergy intervention data filed for the last drug.
In order to provide this functionality, during subsequent allergy
intervention, this patch will now prompt
"No Allergy Assessment - Do you want to duplicate Intervention? Yes//"
 
If the answer is "No," then it will prompt for a new intervention.
 
If the answer is "Yes," then it will display the last intervention
entered. The following is an example.
 
INTERVENTION DATE: DEC 11, 2008       PATIENT: PSOPAT,NAME
PROVIDER: PSOPROV, NAME               PHARMACIST: PSOPHARM, NAME
DRUG: "current order drug name"       INSTITUTED BY: PHARMACY
INTERVENTION: ALLERGY                 RECOMMENDATION: OTHER
ORIGINATING PACKAGE: OUTPATIENT       DIVISION: OKLAHOMA CITY VAMC
 
Would you like to edit this Intervention? No//
 
If "No," then the system accepts the intervention and continues.
If "Yes," then the system allows editing of the intervention.
 
 
2. PSI-07-181 (PSPO# 865) - Remedy Ticket # HD208961
 
A prescription's strength was changed in Computerized Patient Record
System V. 1.0 (CPRS) creating a new Rx. The original Rx had been
transmitted to Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) on the
previous day. When finishing, the pharmacist missed the previous day's
transmission to CMOP of the original prescription. Both Rxs were mailed
to the patient in the same package from the CMOP.
 
When a CMOP prescription with a status of Transmitted or Retransmitted is
discontinued by a background process to the Outpatient Pharmacy options,
e.g. CPRS or Registration V. 5.3 packages, then an email notifying that a
prescription was just discontinued for that Rx will be sent to the new PSX
EXTERNAL DISPENSE ALERTS mail group created by patch PSX*2*68 (see
PSX*2*68 patch description for details). If no recipients are defined in
the new mail group, then it will be sent to PSXCMOPMGR key holders. The
email alert will inform the group that the CMOP status for the Rx just
discontinued was either Transmitted or Retransmitted as seen in the
example below.

When a CMOP prescription with a status of Transmitted or Retransmitted is

The FY10 Q1 Enhancement Release includes the following.
 
1. PSPO #1167
   The following enhancements were made for the Flagged Pending Orders.
   a. When using the Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option,
      the message "&lt;There are ## flagged orders for INSTITUTION&gt;" is
      displayed in reverse video to alert the user that there are
      flagged pending orders.
 
   b. At the prompt, "Select By:  (PA/RT/PR/CL/FL/E): PATIENT//", the help
      text "FL FLAG" was changed to "FL FLAGGED".
 
2. PSPO #1101 - Remedy Ticket #275487
   The following enhancements were made to the prescription laser label.
   a. The current title "Additional Warning Labels" that is printed at
      the top of the PMI section was renamed to "Additional Warnings".
 
   b. If the warning label is lengthy, requiring more than the four
      provided lines, the label is truncated so the text "... See printed
      Additional Warnings." can be added to the end of the fourth line.
 
   c. The truncated warning label and its code are printed in their
      entirety at the top of the PMI section under the "Additional
      Warnings" section.
 
3. Remedy Ticket #345084
   The warning message "&lt;There are ## flagged orders for INSTITUTION&gt;" is not
   displayed when there is only one associated CPRS ordering institution
   with an outpatient site. Routine PSOORFI2 was corrected to fix this
   problem.

The output of this report is in a delimited output format suitable for 
export to MS Excel and includes data from original prescription fills,
refills and partial fills. The report output is sorted primarily by
patient name and secondarily by prescription number.
 
Each fill of the prescription is printed on a separate line. Each 
prescription detail line starts with a double backslash followed by an
identifier to denote the type of fill (ORIGINAL, REFILL, PARTIAL). 
Each line contains 38 fields separated by up-arrow ("^") as described 
below:

MISCELLANEOUS FIX:
------------------
 
The recently released patch PSO*7*326 provided the enhanced functionality
to look up patient by prescription number in backdoor pharmacy. After
installing this patch, four sites reported that they were unable to
retrieve patient information by swiping the Veterans Identity Card (VIC),
which had not been a problem before patch 326 installation. 
 
The output of this particular card reader is in the format:
"%99999999^XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX^99999999^^^^N^9999999999?"
 
The code change that was made to retrieve patient by prescription number 
in patch 326 was not allowing the use of up-arrow ("^") characters as 
part of the input data, hence the failure. This patch 348 addresses the 
issue.

"Coord. Of Benefits:" followed by either PRIMARY, SECONDARY, or TERTIARY.
 
Example:
 
   INSURANCE Information
   Insurance      : OPP INSURANCE            Coord. Of Benefits: PRIMARY
   Contact        :
   Group Name     : D-GROUP1
   Group Number   : D00001
   Cardholder ID  :
 
2. A COB field(#27) was added to the PRESCRIPTION file (#52),
REJECT INFO sub-file (#52.25) to store the COB for the Third Party 
Insurance Rejects for the fill. The Set of Codes will be stored as "1" for
Primary, "2" for Secondary, and "3" for Tertiary. Tertiary billing will 
not be implemented with this patch group, but is included for future use.

This patch is part of a combined build, made up of the following three 
patches:
       OR*3.0*272           (Computerized Patient Record System)
       PSJ*5.0*181           (Inpatient Medications)
       PSO*7.0*251          (Outpatient Pharmacy)
 
These patches will replace most of current VistA medication order 
checking system with version 1.0 of the new Medication Order Check 
Healthcare Application (MOCHA) system that uses the First DataBank (FDB) 
Drug Information Framework (DIF) interfaces and database. The VistA Drug 
Interaction module will be replaced by the FDB Drug-Drug Interaction 
Module (DDIM). The VistA Duplicate Class module will be replaced by the 
FDB Enhanced Therapeutic Classification (ETC) System.
 
In addition, the following three order checks that use VistA data have
been added to Inpatient Medications and Outpatient Pharmacy. These checks
currently occur in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), but will be
new to Pharmacy with the installation of these patches:
     Aminoglycoside Ordered
     Dangerous Meds for Patients &gt; 64
     Glucophage - Lab Results
 
A new Graphical User Interface (GUI) module is also being introduced 
called Pharmacy Enterprise Customization System (PECS), to be used only 
by members of Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM). It will allow PBM to 
customize the data provided by FDB for use in VistA.
 
The following three patient safety issues have also been addressed in 
these patches:
       Order Checks on PreMix IV Solutions (PSI-06-012)
       Order Check display sequence changes (PSI-07-080)
       Eliminating confusion in Inpatient Medications Order Check display 
       and processing (PSI-07-080)

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch contains software modifications to the Outpatient Pharmacy (OP)
V. 7.0 application to support the FDA Medication Guides project. The 
project objective is to allow pharmacy staff to retrieve the FDA Medication 
Guide for prescriptions that contain FDA approved information that can help
patients avoid serious adverse events. The FDA requires that Medication
Guides be included with certain prescribed drugs and biological products 
when the Agency determines that: 
 
 . Certain information is necessary to prevent serious adverse effects 
 . Patient decision-making should be advised by information about a known
   serious side effect with a product, or 
 . Patient adherence to directions for the use of a product is essential
   to its effectiveness. 
 
The features in the FDA Medication Guides project are being delivered in
incremental releases. This patch is part of the Increment 2 release. The 
features included in this release are:
 
 . Establishment of a Server Repository for FDA Medication Guides within 
   the VA network.
 
 . Updates to 900+ entries in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) to store the 
   corresponding FDA Medication Guide document name will be provided via
   the NDF Monthly Data Update patches.
 
 . Introduction of a PC based Java software component to enable the
   automatic retrieval of an FDA Medication Guide from within VistA. The
   software does not require any direct user interaction. It works as a 
   bridge between VistA and the PC where it is installed. The software 
   identifies a request from VistA for a specific FDA Medication Guide and
   automatically retrieves it from the Server Repository and displays to the
   user via the Internet Explorer browser. 
  
 . Introduction of a new option called Display FDA Medication Guide [PSN MED
   GUIDE] to the National Drug File V. 4.0 application for retrieving and 
   displaying the FDA Medication Guide for a specific VA Product.
 
 . Introduction of new functionality to the Patient Prescription Processing
   [PSO LM BACKDOOR] option in the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 application
   for retrieving and displaying the FDA Medication Guide for a specific 
   prescription.

The FDA Medication Guides project is expected to complete in three 
increments. Among other features, the next Increment will automate the 
printing of FDA Medication Guides for prescriptions dispensed by the VA
via Outpatient Pharmacy application when the prescription label is printed.
   
The following modification is inclued in this patch (PSO*7*343):
  
Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option
 
  Pharmacists will be able to retrieve an FDA Medication Guide for a 
  specific prescription by selecting the prescription and invoking the OTH
  (Other OP Actions) hidden action and choosing the new item MG Display FDA
  Medication Guide. A Java software component running at the user's PC will 
  then display the FDA Medication Guide Adobe Acrobat document (.pdf) by 
  automatically opening it via the user's default web browser, which will
  allow the users to print it to any printer available to them, as seen 
  below:
       
                       --- Other OP Actions ---
      PN   Progress Note (OP)
      AP   Action Profile (OP)

<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2011-04-28 16:15:19</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-17.html">USER,SEVENTEEN</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Patches PSO*7*316 and GMTS*2.7*92 correct issues reported with the 
Tool #2: Medication Worksheet. The Health Summary patch GMTS*2.7*92
will require patch PSO*7*316 and will create a national entry in the
HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT file (#142.1) for Tool #2: Medication Worksheet.
 
1. The existing Application Program Interface (API) #4827 did not
   return fields required by Tool #2: Medication Worksheet.
 
Problem:
--------
Routine PSS^PSO59 returns data about the demographics of outpatient 
pharmacy divisions, such as site name and address.  The existing API did 
not return the division's assigned area code and phone number, which are 
present in the format of Tool #2: Medication Worksheet.
 
Resolution:
-----------
This patch modifies routine PSO59 to return the AREA CODE field (#.03)
and PHONE NUMBER field (#.04) as part of the target array.
 
2.  Routine PSOQUAP distributed with patch PSO*7*294 is not used.
 
Problem:
--------
During testing of patch PSO*7*294, changes were made that resulted in 
routine PSOQUAP being no longer required.  The routine was left in the 
patch at the time in order to reduce the remaining testing time required.
 
Resolution:
-----------
This patch removes routine PSOQUAP.  There are no known programs that 
call this routine.
 
3.  PSO*7*294 was noncompliant with Programming Standards and 
    Conventions (SAC) for VistA applications.
 
Problem:
--------
During the internal review of some of the routines distributed with 
PSO*7*294 findings uncovered some SAC standard violations.
 
Resolution:
-----------
Routines PSOQ0186 and PSOQMCAL are being replaced with GMTSPST2.  
Corresponding Health Summary patch GMTS*2.7*92 creates a national Health
Summary component for Tool #2: Medication Worksheet to utilize the
replacement routines.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch is a follow-up to MEDICATION ORDER CHECK HEALTHCARE 
APPLICATION (MOCHA) 1.0 group of patches.
 
1.  A correction was made to address an occurrence reported in a
test account where Order Checks did not occur and no message was
displayed to the user.  
 
After the message "Now Processing Enhanced Order Checks!  Please wait..."
is displayed, the system calls a Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) 
Application Program Interface (API) that retrieves order check
information.  This API returns a value of -1 for error of some type
occurred, 0 (zero) for order checks complete with no issues found, or 1
for interactions found.  Outpatient Pharmacy was not checking for -1.  
This patch adds the check for -1, and displays a message when -1 is
returned.
 
2.  A misspelling of the word "Interoperability" was corrected in the 
first line of routine PSOORRD2.
 
3.  An undefined error was corrected.  Using the Rx Verification by Clerk 
option, a subscript error occurs after an unsuccessful request to First 
Data Bank (FDB) is recieved.  The variable DFN is undefined and the error
is displayed around the "Verify for" prompt.  The error can present itself
in the following ways:
 
    a. When a page feed occurs just prior to the "Verify for" prompt: 
       &lt;UNDEFINED&gt; VERIFY+2^PSOVER1 *DFN. 
 
    b. During the order check process just before the PDM API is called: 
       &lt;UNDEFINED&gt; OBX+3^PSODDPRE ^TMP(547819387,"PSOPEPS","OUT",0). 
 
4. For a technician entered order, the message "Remote data not available
- Only local order checks processed" was rolling off the screen.  This 
message is displayed in when remote data isn't available just before
therapeutic duplications during the prescription order process.  This has 
been corrected by adding an "Enter to continue" prompt after the message 
is displayed when the user is a technician.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses a request made by the Health Resource Center (HRC) 
to Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 to provide a new standalone option similar
to that of ePharmacy Medication Profile (View Only) [PSO PMP] option for
the Compensation and Record Interchange (CAPRI) system. The Medication
Profile and Refill [PSO HRC PROFILE/REFILL] option will allow users both
to view a patient's medication profile and to refill prescriptions.
 
The patch also corrects the following two issues found in ePharmacy 
Medication Profile (View Only) [PSO PMP] option.
1. The calculation of remaining refills on the medication profile screen. 
   Routine PSOPMP1 was modified to fix the issue.
 
2. When selecting multiple items to be displayed from the medication 
   profile list, only the first selection is displayed. Routine PSOPMP0
   was modified so that all selected items are displayed.
 
Integration Control Registration #4595 was modified to grant the CAPRI 
package access to the Medication Profile and Refill [PSO HRC PROFILE/
REFILL] option.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch is being released as part of Pharmacy Legacy Enhancements 
Fiscal Year 2011 to address the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface
(OPAI) Enhancements. The Pharmacy Data Management patch PSS*1*156 is also
being released as part of this enhancement.
  
Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) facilities have moved to using 
multiple vendors for automated medication dispensing systems to improve
the efficiency of outpatient pharmacy operations. The following
enhancements were made to the Outpatient Pharmacy software to allow any
one division to have more than one Automated Dispensing Device (ADD)
communicating with Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology
Architecture (VistA) through the OPAI.
  
1.  A new file named PHARMACY AUTOMATED DISPENSING DEVICES file (#52.53)
    was created. Entries in this file are required only if the site wants 
    to utilize the multiple dispensing functionality. The new file 
    contains the following fields:
   
    NAME - A free-text field that is between 3-30 characters in length. 
           It is the name given to the automated dispensing device.
    DNS  - A free-text field that is between 1-50 characters in length. It
           stores the DNS name or IP address of the automated dispensing 
           device.
    PORT - This field is a numeric between 1 and 65535 with no decimal 
           places. It stores the port associated with the automated
           dispensing device.
    INACTIVE 
    DATE - This is a date field, not required, but is used to inactivate 
           the OPAI connection to an automated dispensing device.
 
2.  A new menu option named Enter/Edit Automated Dispensing Devices [PSO 
    AUTO DISPENSING DEVICE] was created to maintain the PHARMACY 
    AUTOMATED DISPENSING DEVICES file (#52.53). The option is located
    under the Maintenance (Outpatient Pharmacy) [PSO MAINTENANCE] menu.
    Only sites planning to use the multiple automated dispensing devices
    for an outpatient division should use this option.
 
3.  A new sub-file (#59.20081) multiple named OPAI was added to the 
    DISPENSING SYSTEM PRINTER sub-file (#59.02008) in the OUTPATIENT SITE 
    file (#59). The sub-file contains the following new fields:
  
    DNS NAME      - This field is a pointer to the PHARMACY AUTOMATED 
                    DISPENSING DEVICES file (#52.53).
    CATEGORY      - Categories provide the flexibility of routing RXs to
                    different ADDs. This field contains the following set
                    of codes:
                    MCS    MAIL - CS
                    MNCS   MAIL - NCS
                    MAIL   MAIL
                    WCS    WINDOW - CS
                    WNCS   WINDOW - NCS
                    WIND   WINDOW
                    CS     CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE
                    NCS    NONCONTROLLED SUBSTANCE
                    A      ANY
                    S      STORAGE
   
4.  The Site Parameter Enter/Edit [PSO SITE PARAMETERS] option was   
    modified for addition of the new fields in the OPAI multiple
    (#59.20081) in the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59).
  
5.  During prescription processing, if the label printer selected has 
    ADDs defined then Rx will be routed to the appropriate ADDs. A message
    will be displayed indicating the ADDs where the Rx will be routed.
    Below is an example of the routing message.
 
      PRESCRIPTIONS SENT TO:
        OPTIFILL1
          100002815      ACETAMINOPHEN 325MG C.T.
          100002816      AMOXICILLIN 250MG CAP
          100002824      AMOXAPINE 50MG TAB
   
        SCRIPTPRO1
          100002844      CIMETIDINE 200MG TAB
   
6.  During testing a problem was discovered in the Print from Suspense
    File [PSO PNDLBL] and Reprint Batches from Suspense [PSO PNDRPT] 
    options. The ZTIO variable, which stores the label printer, was being
    reset to null after processing each patient prescription. As a result 
    a printer defined with multiple ADDs was not routing prescriptions 
    properly. Routines PSOSULBL and PSOSUSRP were modified to address this
    problem.
 
7.  A new Integration Control Registration (ICR) #5579 was created to 
    grant the Pharmacy Data Management package read access to the PHARMACY
    AUTOMATED DISPENSING DEVICES file (#52.53).
 
8.  As per the User Group request, when a dispense complete message is 
    received by VistA from the external dispensing interface and if the 
    mail tracking information is included in the 13th piece of the RXD 
    segment, then the activity log will be updated with this information.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
his patch contains software modifications to the Outpatient Pharmacy (OP)
V. 7.0 application to support the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
Medication Guides - Increment 3 project. The project objective is to allow
pharmacy staff to retrieve the FDA Medication Guide for prescription items
that contain FDA approved information that can help patients avoid adverse
events. The FDA requires that Medication Guides be included with certain
prescribed drugs and biological products when the Agency determines that:
 
 . Certain information is necessary to prevent serious adverse effects 
 . Patient decision-making should be advised by information about a known
   serious side effect with a product, or 
 . Patient adherence to directions for the use of a product is essential
   to its effectiveness. 
 
The features in the FDA Medication Guides project are being delivered in
incremental releases. This patch is part of the Increment 3 release, which
is the last planned release. The features included in this release are:
 
 . Ability to create and maintain a list of FDA Medication Guide printers
   for a specific pharmacy division.
 
 . Automatic printing of FDA Medication Guide along with prescription 
   labels.
 
 . Ability to reprint the FDA Medication Guide when reprinting a 
   prescription label.
 
 . Ability to change the FDA Medication Guide printer at any point of the
   dispensing process, similar to changing the label printer.
 
 . Ability to reprint the FDA Medication Guide for any given prescription
   fill or the latest FDA Mediation Guide available for the medication on
   the prescription.
  
 . Identification on the label document that an FDA Medication Guide was
   printed as well and needs to be collated to the documentation before
   being handed over to the patient.
 
 . Changes to the prescription label activity logs showing which specific
   FDA Medication Guide document printed along with the label.
 
 . Changes to the Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) Event log
   showing which specific FDA Medication Guide document was available 
   for the medication when the prescription fill was transmitted to CMOP.
 
 . Introduction of a PC based Java software component to enable the
   automatic printing of an FDA Medication Guide from within VistA. The
   software does not require any direct user interaction. The software 
   identifies a request from VistA for a specific FDA Medication Guide
   and automatically sends it to the FDA Medication Guide printer
   selected by the user within VistA when dispensing the medication.
 
 . Ability to update the Windows network printer name for a specific
   device through the Kernel application. Once the pharmacist selects a
   printer to print the FDA Medication Guide Vista will retrieve the 
   Windows name for the printer and will pass it on to the Java
   application responsible for printing the document.
    
Below is a list of all the applications involved in this release along
with their patch number:

The following modifications are included in this patch (PSO*7*367):
 
1. Site Parameter Enter/Edit [PSO SITE PARAMETERS] option
   ------------------------------------------------------
   Two new parameters are being introduced in this option: 
   a) FDA MED GUIDE PRINT SERVER URL: this field is used to store the
      Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Print Server where the Java
      application responsible for automatically printing of the FDA
      Medication Guides for the division was installed 
      (e.g.,'http://127.0.0.1/'). This field is required for the FDA
      Medication Guide functionality to work properly.
   b) FDA MED GUIDE PRINTER: This is a multiple field used to store a
      list of printers used for printing FDA Medication Guide document 
      for the division. There are two fields in the multiple: 1) FDA
      MED GUIDE PRINTER, which is a pointer to the DEVICE file (#3.5).
      Only devices with a content in the WINDOWS NETWORK PRINTER NAME
      field (#75) are selectable, and 2) DEFAULT PRINTER, which 
      indicates whether the printer selected is to be used as the 
      default printer for the division. Only one printer can be set as
      default printer for each division. This field is not required.
      The printers in this multiple will be displayed for selection
      when the user logs into a division. If there is a printer set as
      the default printer, it will be set as the default printer.
   
  
2. Outpatient Pharmacy Manager [PSO MANAGER] option
   ------------------------------------------------
   When logging into a division, after selecting the Profile and Label
   printers, the user will be prompt to select an FDA Medication Guide
   printer for the current session. If the division selected has a list
   of FDA Medication Guide printers they will be displayed (see below),
   however the user will be able to select other printers as well. The
   HOME and NULL DEVICE are selectable at this point.
 
   Select OPTION NAME: PSO MANAGER       Outpatient Pharmacy Manager
   Outpatient Pharmacy software - Version 
 
   Division:    DIVISION 999 
 
          You are logged on under the DIVISION division.
 
   Select PROFILE PRINTER: HOME//   GENERIC INCOMING TELNET
 
   Select LABEL PRINTER: HOME//   GENERIC INCOMING TELNET
 
   OK to assume label alignment is correct? YES// 
 
   DIVISIONS's FDA Medication Guide Printer(s) on file:
 
     FDA MED GUIDE PRINTER (Default)
 
   Select FDA MED GUIDE PRINTER: FDA MED GUIDE PRINTER//
  
3. Complete Orders from [OERR PSO LMOE FINISH] option
   Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   There are a few enhancements being added to the prescription processing
   options regarding the printing of FDA Medication Guides. Among them:
  
   a) The FDA Medication Guide document will print automatically for
      prescriptions, if there is one available.
 
   b) Users will have the ability to change the FDA Medication Guide 
      printer in the same way they change the label and profile printers
      today.
 
   c) When queuing labels to print, if there is at least one prescription
      with an FDA Medication Guide associated, it will require a valid FDA
      Medication Guide printer to be entered. This is similar to requiring
      a valid printer for the label printer.
 
   d) The actual label document will contain a note under the barcode,
      before the PMI document, that says "Read FDA MED Guide". Such note
      should indicate to the pharmacist that an FDA Medication Guide
      document has been printed for the prescription and should be handed
      to the patient.
 
   e) The Label Log and CMOP Event Log will both list the FDA Medication
      Guide document name (.pdf) associated with each fill.
   
   f) Users will have the ability to reprint the FDA Medication Guide for
      past prescription fills or the latest FDA Medication Guide available
      for the prescription via a new action RM - Reprint FDA Medication
      Guide under the OTH - Other OP Actions menu.
       
4. Print from Suspense File [PSO PNDLBL] option
   --------------------------------------------
   In order to run this option users will be required to enter a valid FDA
   Medication Guide printer. All prescriptions that prints a label via
   this option and that have an FDA Medication Guide associated will have
   the documente printed as well in the designated printer.
 
5. Pull Early from Suspense [PSO PNDRX] option
   -------------------------------------------
   If the prescription being pulled from suspense has an FDA Medication
   Guide associated the user will be required to enter a valid FDA
   Medication Guide printer to where the document will be printed for
   the prescription.
 
6. Change Label Printer [PSO CHANGE PRINTER] option
   ------------------------------------------------
   This option is used by users to change the profile and label printers
   after having logged on to a pharmacy division. It is being modified to
   allow users to change the FDA Medication Guide printer as well.
   
7. Reprint an Outpatient Rx Label [PSO RXRPT] option
   -------------------------------------------------
   If the prescription selected to reprinted the label has an FDA 
   Medication Guide associated, this option will ask whether the user also
   wants to reprint the FDA Medication Guide. If they answer YES, a valid
   FDA Medication Guide printer will be required for the user to proceed
   with the reprinting of the label and FDA Medication Guide.
 
8. Label/Profile Monitor Reprint [PSO B] option
   Reprint External Batches [PSO INTERFACE REPRINT] option
   Reprint Batches from Suspense [PSO PNDRPT] option
   -------------------------------------------------------
   These options are used for reprinting batches of labels that may have 
   jammed on the printer. When reprinting labels via one of these options
   users will be prompted if they also want to reprint the FDA Medication
   Guide. If they answer YES, a valid FDA Medication Guide printer will be
   required for the user to proceed with the reprinting of the label and
   FDA Medication Guide, if one is available.
 
9. The background process that calculates suspense days now rounds any
   partial day to the next full day. This modification was moved from 
   patch PSO*7*385 into this patch due to routine overlap and to avoid
   patch dependency.

The Pharmacy Legacy Enhancements (PLE) Increment 9 Release includes the 
following modifications to the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 application:
 
1. Prescription HOLD/UNHOLD Functionality
   --------------------------------------
   a.  The HOLD REASON field (#99) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) has the
       following set of codes, which is presented to the PSORPH key holder
       during prescription 'HOLD' process:
 
       '1 INSUFFICIENT QTY IN STOCK'
       '2 DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION'
       '3 PATIENT REACTION'
       '4 PHYSICIAN TO BE CONTACTED'
       '5 ALLERGY REACTIONS'
       '6 DRUG REACTION'
       '7 BAD ADDRESS'
       '8 PER PATIENT REQUEST'
       '99 OTHER--SEE COMMENTS'
  
        As per the recommendation of the Pharmacy User Group the 
        following changes were made to the set of codes:
 
        The following new codes were added:
        '9 CONSULT/PRIOR APPROVAL NEEDED'
        '98 OTHER/TECH (NON-CLINICAL)'
        
        The following code descriptions were modified:
        '4 PHYSICIAN TO BE CONTACTED' to '4 PROVIDER TO BE CONTACTED'
        '6 DRUG REACTION' to '6 ADVERSE DRUG REACTION'
        '99 OTHER--SEE COMMENTS' to 'OTHER/RPH (CLINICAL)'
 
        The following codes were removed as they were redundant and code
        '6 ADVERSE DRUG REACTION' to be used in its place:
        '3 PATIENT REACTION' 
        '5 ALLERGY REACTIONS' 
 
        Note:
        A post-install routine has been included in this patch that will
        convert the historical data of codes '3' and '5' to code '6'. 
 
        On complete installation of this patch, the HOLD REASON field 
        (#99) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) will have the following set
        of codes:
        '1 INSUFFICIENT QTY IN STOCK'
        '2 DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION'
        '4 PROVIDER TO BE CONTACTED'
        '6 ADVERSE DRUG REACTION'
        '7 BAD ADDRESS'
        '8 PER PATIENT REQUEST'
        '9 CONSULT/PRIOR APPROVAL NEEDED'
        '98 OTHER/TECH (NON-CLINICAL)'
        '99 OTHER/RPH (CLINICAL)'
 
   b. New Security Key PSO TECH ADV for pharmacy technicians
      A new security key called PSO TECH ADV has been created, which 
      will allow a user to HOLD a prescription using one of the following
      HOLD reasons, which are a subset of the hold reasons that are
      available to the PSORPH key holders in item (a) above:
 
      '1 INSUFFICIENT QTY IN STOCK'
      '7 BAD ADDRESS'
      '8 PER PATIENT REQUEST'
      '98 OTHER/TECH (NON-CLINICAL)'
 
      The PSO TECH ADV key holders will be able to remove a prescription
      from HOLD only for the above hold reasons whether they were put 
      on HOLD by the PSORPH key holder or by the PSO TECH ADV key holder.
 
   c. UNHOLD Comments
      The UNHOLD action has been modified to display the original hold 
      reason along with the hold comments (if any) as seen in the example
      below:
      
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Select Action: Next Screen// UH   UH  UNHOLD                        |
| Nature of Order: WRITTEN//        W                                 |
|                                                                     |
| HOLD COMMENTS: HOLD COMMENTS ENTERED BY THE USER MANUALLY. (REASON: |
|                BAD ADDRESS) on MAY 10, 2012                         |
|                                                                     |
| UNHOLD COMMENTS:                                                    |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 
   d. Rx Activity Log
      All activities related to HOLD/UNHOLD action on a prescription will
      be captured in the activity log as seen below:
 
     
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Activity Log:                                                       |
| #   Date        Reason         Rx Ref         Initiator Of Activity |
| ...                                                                 |
| 8   05/10/12    HOLD           REFILL 1       USER,PHARMACY         |
| Comments: Rx placed on HOLD (Reason: BAD ADDRESS) and removed from  |
|           SUSPENSE - HOLD COMMENTS ENTERED BY THE USER MANUALLY.    |
| ...                                                                 |
| 9   05/10/12    UNHOLD         REFILL 1       USER,PHARMACY         |
| Comments: Rx Removed from HOLD - UNHOLD COMMENTS ENTERED BY THE USER|
|           WHEN REMOVING THE RX FROM HOLD.                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 
 
2. Flagging/Unflagging of a pending renewal order
   ----------------------------------------------
   The flagging/unflagging functionality was limited to new pending orders
   only from Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 3.0. Changes
   were made to extend this functionality to pending renewal orders from
   CPRS as well.
   Note: Flagging/Unflagging is a functionality for the pharmacist (PSORPH
         key holders) only.
 
3. Non-holders of PSORPH key were able to unflag pending orders
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   The action FL (Flag/Unflag) is blocked for users without the PSORPH
   key when finishing a new pending order. However, if the user selected 
   FN (Finish) to finish a new flagged pending order the software was
   allowing the user to unflag the pending order. This has been changed
   to no longer allow non-holders of the PSORPH key to unflag pending 
   orders.
 
4. Non PSORPH key holder access to Edit/DC actions
   -----------------------------------------------
   When processing pending new/renewal orders from CPRS, a non PSORPH key
   holder could use the actions 'Edit' or 'Discontinue' on the order, 
   which should not be allowed. This functionality has been disabled.
 
5. COMMENT field (#.05) in the ACTIVITY LOG sub-file (#52.3) of the 
   PRESCRIPTION file (#52)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   The length of this field has been increased from 75 to 100 characters
   long to accommodate HOLD and UNHOLD comments.
  
6. PSO52API API (Application Programming Interface)
   ------------------------------------------------
   This API was modified to check if the prescription's expiration date 
   is in the past. If it is and the current prescription status is not
   DISCONTINUED, DELETED, or EXPIRED, the API will update the prescription
   status to EXPIRED. The API will also send updates to CPRS and Health
   Data Repository (HDR) of the status change.

This patch is being released as part of the DEA e-Prescribing of
Controlled Substances (CS) project using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
to satisfy requirements requested by the Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA).
The applications involved in this project along with their patch numbers 
are listed below and the same order should be followed when installing 
the patches.

   OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                        PSO*7*391
 
Note:
1. A new security key named "PSDRPH", has been sent out in the Controlled
   Substances patch PSD*3*76, which is a required patch for this patch.
   This key authorizes pharmacists to finish/verify a digitally signed
   Schedule II-V CS orders placed via CPRS and should be assigned to
   registered pharmacists working with Schedule II-V drugs.
 
2. Patches PSO*7*391 and PSD*3*73 are being released in the Kernel 
   Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build distribution
   CPRSV29_PSO_PSD. 
 
The following modifications and enhancements are included in this patch 
(PSO*7*391):
 
1. When processing a digitally signed pending order, the integrity of the 
original order placed in CPRS is now being checked to ensure that the data
fields listed below are not altered from the time the order is signed in
CPRS and later selected for processing in backdoor pharmacy. This is done
by passing the data elements listed below to a Kernel Application
Programming Interface (API), Integration Control Registration (ICR) #3539,
along with the CPRS hash count, provided by ICR #5709. The Kernel API
compares these two hash values and returns an "OK" if the pending order is
unaltered or otherwise, returns a "-1^error code^error message."
 
Example: "-1^89802016^Mismatched digital signature hash values."
 
These are the fields used in the hash check:
        Date of Issuance
        Full Name and Address of the Patient
        Drug Name
        Quantity Prescribed  
        Directions for Use
        Prescriber Name   
        Prescriber Address (site address) 
        Prescriber DEA / VA Registration Number
        Order Number (CPRS)
 
The Kernel API will also check for the validity of the DEA certificate. If
the certificate is revoked or expired then the API will return the
appropriate error code.
If the error code is related to hash mismatch or the DEA certificate is
revoked then the following events will be triggered during pending order
processing:
  The order will be auto discontinued.
  First line of the pending order screen will have the message "Digital
  Signature Failed: Corrupted (Hash mismatch)" or "Certificate revoked"
  concatenated with "Order Auto Discontinued", and the message will be
  highlighted in reverse video.
  The status bar of the screen will have the message "Signature Failed: 
  Corrupted (Hash mismatch)" or Certificate revoked."
  A mail message will be generated to the holders of the PSDMGR key 
  notifying that the order has been auto discontinued (similar to the 
  example listed below).
  If the discontinuation is due to a hash mismatch as a result of altering
  one of the fields listed above then the mail message will show the
  altered fields with the discrepancies. Here is an example:
 
  Subj: DIGITALLY SIGNED NEW ORDER AUTO DISCONTINUED  [#196353] 
        03/20/12@17:1024 lines
  From: POSTMASTER  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1  *New*

  If the error code is related to 'certificate expired', the pending 
  order will be processed (will not be auto discontinued) and a 
  notification will be sent to the provider with the message, "DEA
  certificate expired. Renew your certificate."
 
2. When finishing a pending CS order, if the user does not hold the new 
   PSDRPH security key, the order will be marked as 'Non-Verified'.
 
3. To verify a 'Non-Verified' CS order, PSDRPH security key is now
   required.
 
4. To discontinue a pending CS order, PSDRPH security key is now required.
 
5. The pending order screen will now display the provider's DEA/VA #, the 
   DETOX# (if available) and the site address.
 
6. When finishing a new pending CS order, the orderable item, dosage, 
   provider name, or the number of refills will not be allowed to be 
   edited. Also, if the changes to the dispense drug would result in
   a new order being created, this will not be allowed for digitally 
   signed orders. The user WILL be allowed to select other dispense drugs 
   for the same Orderable Item as long as it does not change the 
   prescribed dosage.
 
7. When finishing a new pending CS order, the days supply or the quantity
   will not be allowed to increase, but can be decreased. If the days
   supply is decreased, the number of refills will also be adjusted 
   accordingly depending on the drug setup (maximum refills, not 
   refillable etc).
 
8. In patch PSO*7*99, a change was made for pending orders not to 
   recalculate the quantity for CS drugs on selecting a different strength
   of the same drug and resulting in the same prescribed dosage. This
   change is removed in this patch.
 
9. When finishing a pending CS order or verifying a CS order by the PSDRPH
   key holder, any edit to some of the key fields like dispense drug,
   dosage, dispense units, issue date, day's supply, quantity or number of
   refills, will now be captured and stored in the activity log.
 
10. In the Complete Orders From OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option, a new sort 
    selection, 'CS' is included to select digitally signed CS orders 
    separately.
 
11. A new field BACKDOOR SIGNATURE STATUS (#311) is being added to the 
    PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and will be set to '1' to indicate that the CS
    order was entered via pharmacy backdoor and was not digitally signed.
 
12. A new field, DIRECTIONS FOR USE (#120) is being added to the PENDING
    OUTPATIENT ORDERS file (#52.41) to store the raw HEALTH LEVEL SEVEN
    (HL7) dosage data as sent from CPRS. This will be used to validate the
    integrity (hash count) against the CPRS digitally signed orders.
 
13. Currently, the pending order screen displays only the number of 
    refills ordered by the provider. For digitally signed orders, this
    is modified to include the days supply and the quantity. Here is a
    screen capture:
    (6)    Issue Date: SEP 17,2012        (7) Fill Date: SEP 17,2012
    (8)    Days Supply: 45                (9)   QTY (  ): 45
   Provider ordered: days supply 45, quantity 45 &amp; refills 1    
   (10)   # of Refills: 1                (11)  Routing: WINDOW
 
14. The protocols PSO LM ACCEPT and PSO LM RENEW MENU are being modified
    to add code to the SCREEN field (#24) and the HEADER field (#26) of
    the PROTOCOL file (#101) to ensure users are limited to ListMan
    actions based on their security key.
 
15. As part of this project, Kernel patch XU*8*580 introduced the 
    following new fields to the NEW PERSON file (#200). Apart from the 
    DEA#/VA# requirement, DEA further classifies what CS schedule a
    provider is authorized to write. 
 
    55.1      SCHEDULE II NARCOTIC (S), [PS3;1]
    55.2      SCHEDULE II NON-NARCOTIC (S), [PS3;2]
    55.3      SCHEDULE III NARCOTIC (S), [PS3;3]
    55.4      SCHEDULE III NON-NARCOTIC (S), [PS3;4]
    55.5      SCHEDULE IV (S), [PS3;5]
    55.6      SCHEDULE V (S), [PS3;6]
 
    If any one of the above fields are populated for a provider then when
    placing a new order in backdoor pharmacy, the software will now check
    for the drug schedule with the provider privileges. If the provider
    does not have the credentials to write such orders then the software
    will display a message (as shown below) and will not allow the 
    selection that provider.
    Example: When the provider does not have schedule 2 privileges, this
    message is displayed: 
    "Provider not authorized to write Federal Schedule 2 prescriptions."
 
16. When placing an order for a CS Detoxification drug, the software will 
    now check for a valid Detoxification number for the provider. If the 
    provider does not have a Detoxification number then the software will 
    display a message "Provider must have a DETOX# to order this drug."
 
17. The Released and Unreleased Prescription Report [PSO RELEASE REPORT] 
    is being modified to include CS as a selection to the input. The drug
    name and CS schedule is being added to the output. Here are the
    changes:                         
 
You are currently logged in under the CHEYENNE VAM&amp;ROC division.
Do you want to select a different division? NO// 
 
Do you want ONLY Unreleased Prescriptions? NO// 
Include (C)S Rx only, (N)on CS Rx only, or (B)oth (C/N/B): B// Controlled 
Substances Rxs Only
 
Select controlled substance schedules
 
     Select one of the following:
 
          1         SCHEDULES I - II
          2         SCHEDULES III - V
          3         SCHEDULES I - V
 
Select Schedule(s): 3// 
 
The report currently shows the count of unreleased and copay
prescriptions, but not the count of released prescriptions. The report is
modified with this patch to include the count of released prescriptions.
 
18. The following options are being modified to include the
    DETOX/MAINTENANCE ID NUMBER field (#53.11) and the DEA EXPIRATION DATE
    field (#747.44) of the NEW PERSON file (#200) as part of the screen. 
    The DEA EXPIRATION DATE field will be prompted only if the PROVIDER
    TYPE field (#53.6) of the NEW PERSON file (#200) is marked as "FEE 
    BASIS".
 
    Add New Providers [PSO PROVIDER ADD]
    Edit Provider [PSO PROVIDER EDIT]
    View Provider [PSO PROVIDER INQUIRE]
 
19. Currently, the default days supply for all drugs is set from the DAYS 
    SUPPLY field (#3) of the RX PATIENT STATUS file (#53) up to a maximum
    of 90. With this project, the default for CS schedule II-V drugs will
    be set to 30 or from the DAYS SUPPLY field (#3) of the RX PATIENT
    STATUS file (#53) if it is less than 30. Also, the Integration Control
    Registration #3278 that returns days supply (DSUP^PSOSIGDS) to CPRS is
    modified to return 30 or from the DAYS SUPPLY field (#3) of the RX
    PATIENT STATUS file (#53) if it is less than 30 for CS schedule II-V
    drugs.
 
20. The pharmacy release slip portion of the Laser Label is being 
    modified to include the text "(DSIG)" or "(NOT DSIG)" after the
    patient's name to indicate that the prescription is digitally signed
    or not digitally signed.
 
21. This patch addresses the issue reported in REMEDY ticket #595795, to
    ensure that when editing an orderable item/dispensed drug, the 
    instruction field is displayed only when editing the pending order 
    and not when editing an active or non-verified order.
 
22. The Expire Prescriptions [PSO EXPIRE PRESCRIPTIONS] option that 
    currently runs as a nightly job is being modified to check for the
    Institutional DEA 'expiration date'. If the expiration date is within
    30 calendar days or past expiration then a mail message will be
    generated and sent to PSDMGR key holders. Here is an example when the
    expiration date is within 30 days:
 
Subj: 500:Institutional DEA Expiration Date is about to expire  [#140331]
03/20/12@11:57  3 lines
From: POSTMASTER  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1  *New*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Please update Institutional DEA Certification Date. Will expire on 
3/24/12.
 
******************************
 
Here is an example when the DEA Expiration Date is past expiration date:
 
 
Subj: 500:Institutional DEA Expiration Date has expired  [#140333]
03/20/12@12:08  3 lines
From: POSTMASTER  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1  *New*
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Please update Institutional DEA Certification Date. Expired on 2/19/12.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This is a follow-up patch for PSO*7*391 that was part of Computerized 
Patient Record System (CPRS) Graphic User Interface (GUI) v29. CPRS GUI 
v29 will be a phased implementation and therefore, this patch, PSO*7*426,
should be installed after CPRS GUI v29 bundle is installed.
 
Hines reported that when finishing a complex pending order if 'month' is
part of duration then the order is discontinued due to hash mismatch. This
is due to pharmacy storing 'month' as "L" and CPRS storing as "M". This
patch resolves this problem by tweaking the hash check code to represent
"L" as "M" when "L" is found in the duration field.
