<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This Build:
 
1) deletes the Soundex cross-reference from the NAME field (#.01) of the
   GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82).
 
2) fixes a possible undefined variable error (GMRAREC) in the routine
   GMRASIG1.
 
3) fixes a FOR loop which uses the wrong variable to loop through an
   array in the routine GMRAPTB.
 
4) fixes the problem reported in NOIS NOP-0596-12146. A user presses
   RETURN or enters an up-arrow at the Causative Agent prompt and is
   prompted to enter another causative agent.
 
5) fixes the problem reported in NOIS ISH-0596-42277. Under certain
   instances the 'Sign-off' event point is not being executed.
 
6) modifies the field description for the REQUIRE ORIGINATOR COMMENTS
   field (#4) in the GMR ALLERGY SITE PARAMETERS file (#120.84).
   NOIS CLA-0696-20854.
 
7) fixes a problem where the REACTION ASSESSMENT field (#1) in the ADVERSE
   REACTION ASSESSMENT file (#120.86) is marked 1 (yes), but the patient
   does not have any active entries (i.e., entries that have not been
   entered-in-error) in the PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8).
   NOIS: CMO-0696-40833.
 
8) identifies the patient (e.g., T1234), suspect medication and event date
   on the Attachment page of the MedWatch form. NOIS: BRX-0696-11081.
 
9) modifies the GMRADPT utility to return "unsigned" reactions in the
   GMRAL array.
 
10) changes the ORCHK^GMRAOR utility call. If the calling routine is
    checking for Contrast Media Reactions and the patient is not in the
    ART database, then the utility will return a null value instead of a
    0 (zero).
 
11) fixes a bug in the GMRADPT utility which returns a GMRAL array node
    stating the person has No Known Allergies if the person is not in the
    ART database.
 
12) fixes a bug in the GMRANKA routine which may enter the wrong value in
    the ADVERSE REACTION ASSESSMENT file (#120.86), REACTION ASSESSMENT
    field (#1). NOIS: MAR-0696-21799.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This Build addresses the following problems:
 
1) Corrects a bug introduced by the GMRA*4.0*2 patch. Users are not being
asked to sign-off on autoverified reactions in the enter/edit reaction
process if they answer YES to the "Enter another Causative Agent?" prompt,
but do not enter another causative agent. This results in the reaction not
be considered as autoverified.
 
2) When a user mistakenly answers YES to the "Does this patient have any
known allergies or adverse reactions?" prompt and does not enter a
causative agent the software assesses the patient as having a reaction on
file in the database. It should not.
 
3) The GMRA PRINT-COMPLETE LISTING option does not distinguish between
patients who not in the ART database and those patients who are assessed
as NKA (No Known Allergies).
 
4) The ART package calls an Outpatient Pharmacy utility to get and display
any outpatient medications for a patient. The SIG code value for the
prescription return is changing in size from one line of text to one plus
lines of text. The ART package will store the first 30 characters of the
SIG code for its SUSPECT and CONCOMITANT drug entries in File 120.85.
 
5) Changes the description for the GMRA PRINT-FDA EXCEPT BY PT option so
that it accurately describes what that option does.
 
6) Changes the description for the GMRA PRINT-EXCEPT BY DATe option so
that it accurately describes what that option does.
 
For more detailed information please see the GMRA*4*5 patch description on
FORUM.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This build fixes several problems in the ART portion of the ART-CPRS
interface.
 
Routine changes:
 
 GMRAOR0
   The DUPCHK entry point was quitting prematurely and therefore not
   accurately checking for duplicate entries.
 
 GMRAOR4
   The ART EP asked the CPRS developers to include the OBSERVER field
   value for all new reactions CPRS sends to the ART package. This routine
   was changed to recognize this piece of data when it is passed to ART.
 
 GMRAOR5
   Fixes a syntax error.
 
   Simplifies some code used to check for duplicate patient reactions.
 
   Fixes a bug where the reaction was not completely filed if the reaction
   value pointer and file was not recognized as one of the five pointed-to
   files used by the ART package.
 
   Modifies the code to call GMRAOR9 to store any drug ingredients or drug
   classes if the reaction was of a drug type.
 
   Modifies the code to add an entry to File 120.85 only if the patient
   reaction was an observed drug reaction.
   
   Sends the reaction as unverified so it will appear on the
   list of reactions to be verified.
 
 GMRAOR7
   The sign/symptom data was not being stored in File 120.85 because a
   call to SIGN^GMRAOR6 was passing the variable GMRAL when it should send
   the array GMRAL.
 
 GMRAOR8
   This routine was modified to correct subfile numbers being set
   in fileman.
 
 GMRAOR9 
   This is a new routine which stores drug ingredients and/or drug classes
   for a patient drug reaction.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The METHOD OF NOTIFICATION field in file 120.84 is used to determine the
users that should receive the chart and ID band marking bulletin. If this
field is set to OE/RR TEAMS, the code made reference to PCMM team lists.
CPRS has ceased use of PCMM teams for list functionality.   The errant
reference to PCMM caused an error when a patient with data in the ADVERSE
REACTION TRACKING (ART) database was admitted. The same error can be
generated when a new adverse reaction is entered and the charts and/or ID
bands have not been marked. patch corrects this error by changing the
reference to use the OE/RR LIST (#100.21) file.
 
DBIA #1471 has been retired which allowed ART to call ALLERGY^RAUTL3 in
This patch corrects this error by changing the reference to use file 12d
RADIOLOGY/NUCLEAR MEDICINE v 4.5 to retrieve and store information
relating to allergies to radiologic contrast media. This reference is
being removed from the ART software.

Remedy ticket HD67463 was logged because the site noticed that deceased 
patients were appearing on the [GMRA PRINT-PATIENT NOT ASKED] report.  
This report lists patients who have not been given an allergy/adverse 
reaction assessment.  The sites then use this list and contact the 
patients in an attempt to get the assessment information from them.  It 
is not desirable for the VA to inadvertently contact the family of a 
deceased individual in an attempt to get the allergy/adverse reaction 
information for that person.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses Remedy ticket, HD67403.  The site reported
that test patients entered in production are appearing on the
Adverse Reaction Tracking reports, and are also being included in
report counts.
   
This patch will update the Adverse Reaction Tracking reports that 
display the patient name and/or SSN, and reports that produce counts
of reaction data so that they all exclude test patients.
   
This patch will also correct a problem with the bulletin generation during
entry of Adverse Reactions described in Remedy ticket HD85125.
   
The problem occurs when the user answers "No" to verify an observed/drug 
adverse reaction when it is first entered.  If the user skips the 
verification step but then uses the GMRA PATIENT A/AR EDIT option and 
edits the existing observed/drug allergy and then verifies it (with or 
without making changes) an additional NOTIFICATION OF OBSERVED DRUG 
REACTION bulletin is triggered.
   
This patch will modify the logic in the code so that, if the user 
re-enters the adverse reaction and then verifies it, a second 
NOTIFICATION OF OBSERVED DRUG REACTION bulletin will not be triggered.
