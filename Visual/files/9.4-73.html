<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 4 routines have been modified in this patch:
 
    1. AFJXPNHX Multiple sites have reported problems in routine AFJXPNHX
       at QNEW+2. It appears that multiple jobs, not necessarily the NHE
       purge, are running at the same time. These routines are
       manipulating and deleting messages in the mailboxes and mail
       global.  This patch is generated to remove the effects of the
       unwanted job interference.  
 
    2. AFJXWCP8 The routine AFJXWCP8 was found to contain references to
       file 6 and to file 16. The pointers are now properly referenced to
       file 200.  
 
    3. AFJXADHD It was reported that the security alert bulletin on
       sensitive data access occasionally was not generated. A secondary
       access path was discovered through routine AFJXADHD. AFJXADHD is
       now modified to handle the generation of bulletins the same as in
       routine AFJXALRT (which was previously modified to handle this
       problem).
 
    4. AFJXWCPM A site has reported a problem with BOLD being undefined at
       line OPTION in routine AFJXWCPM. This results from IOST(0) either
       being undefined or more probably set to null. Examination shows
       that in such cases BOLD and BOLF are equally apt to cause problems.
       The modification made to clear this problem is to hard set BOLD AND
       BOLF to null before IOST(0) is checked and BOLD and BOLF are
       updated.  
 
 NOIS HISTORY: 
 =============
    The AFJXPNHX problem (undefined in the nightly purge) was reported in
    NOIS ATG-0996-31958, BUT-0896-22000, and FHM-0896-51544.
   
    There has been an access to restricted data problem uncovered in
    routine AFJXADHD (NOIS SBY-1296-30637).
 
    A site has reported a problem with BOLD being undefined at line OPTION
    in routine AFJXWCPM (NOIS DAY-0197-40124). This results from IOST(0)
    either being undefined or more probably set to null.
 
 PATCH HISTORY: 
 ==============
 
    This patch clears the undefined in the nightly purge problems by
    presetting variables used in setting up VA FileMan multiple nodes to
    null. An environmental routine was added to ensure a proper
    sequencing.  
  
    The AFJXPNHX changes in this patch were originally issued as
    AFJX*5.1*4 which was made entered in error due to an error in
    selection of routines contained (NOIS LEA-1196-41840).  This has been
    updated correctly in AFJX*5.1*5.
 
    In the previous AFJX patches the Patch to Package file link was not
    included. As a reult, the package patch history is incomplete. The
    sites are requested to manually update the patch history in the
    Package File to indicate that patches 1 through 3 for AFJX are entered
    into the production routines. Patch 4 was declared to have been
    entered in error, hence need not be entered.

  * From CHECK^XTSUMBLD 
 
  Environmental Check Routine 
  ===========================
   
    The environmental check routine is AFJXEN4 which checks the version 
    and patch levels of the NHE package installed. Routine AFJXEN4 may be 
    removed by the station upon successful installation of this patch.  
   
  Installation Instructions: 
  ==========================
    WHEN?: Anytime. This patch is so brief (only four routines and an 
    environmental check routine) that it should not be queued.  
   
    HOW LONG?:  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  
   
    1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan and respond 
       YES at the prompt 'Want to Continue with load?  YES// &lt;return&gt;.  
                                                       ===
    2. Review your Mapped Routine set. If any of the routines listed in 
       the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped on your system, they should 
       be removed from the Mapped set at this time.  
   
    3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
   
    4. From the Installation menu, you may elect to use the following 
       options (when prompted for the install name, enter AFJX*5.1*5): 
                                                          ==========
       a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
       b. Compare Transport Global to the Current System - this option 
          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when the 
          patch is installed. It compares all components of the patch 
          (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).  
       c. Verify checksums in the Transport Global - this option will 
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in 
          the Transport Global.  
   
    5. Use the Install Package(s) options and select the package:
          AFJX*5.1*5.
          ==========
  
    6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? Yes// &lt;return&gt;, respond YES. When prompted to select the
                                          ===
       option(s) you would like to place out of order, enter the
       following: 
   
          AFJXNHEX REQUEST 
          ================
          AFJX PURGE NIGHTLY 
          ==================
  
    7. MSM sites:  Please ensure you answer YES when asked if you want 
       to move the routines to other systems and indicate the appropriate
       CPUs. Alternatively, you can wait until the installation is
       complete and move the routines listed in the Routine Summary
       Section to all systems.  
 
    8. If the routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
       returned to the Mapped set once the installation has run to
       completion.

Prerequisites: 
============== 
 
    Install patch AFJX*5.1*1 prior to the installation of this patch.  
 
Descriptive Text:
=================
 
    7 routines (AFJXADHD, AFJXALRT, AFJXPNHX, AFJXWCL1, AFJXWCP8, 
    AFJXWCPM, and AFJXWPR2) are modified in this patch.  
 
NOIS: 
====
 NOIS:  REN-0297-60708, BAN-0297-11202, and ATG-0297-31510
 AFJXWCLI - DK RES errors reported in the above NOISs are repaired
          by this patch's changes in routine AFJXWCLI.
          Multiple sites reported unexplained DK RES and similar errors 
          with NHE over the last year. The problem was located in 
          routine AFJXWCL1, where, in module INTRP, the variable 
          GMJ was used as a variable in a FOR loop. First the module 
          RDNODE was called, then module WRTGRM was called, 
          which hard SET the variable GMJ to "GRAM" without any 
          scoping of the variable. If there were any nodes that collated
          after "GRAM," an endless loop resulted. In this loop the 
          global ^TMP("AFHS",$J,CT,0) was set with CT incremented
          each time.  
          The routine was modified to change the program flow so that 
          the original sequencing of data was maintained, but the
          offending hard SET of the variable GMJ was avoided.
 
 NOIS:  ATG-0996-31958, BUT-0896-22000, FHM-0896-51544, and LEA-1196-41840
 AFJXPNHX - Multiple sites have reported problems in routine AFJXPNHX at
            QNEW+2. It appears that multiple jobs, not necessarily the
            NHE purge, are running at the same time. These routines are
            manipulating and deleting messages in the mailboxes and mail 
            global.  This patch is generated to remove the effects of the
            unwanted job interference.  (The changes in AFJXPNHX were
            originally issued in AFJX*5.1*4 which was marked 'Entered in
            Error' due to an error in selection of routines contained.)
  
 AFJXWCP8 - The routine AFJXWCP8 was found to contain references to file
            6 and to file 16. The pointers are now properly referenced to
            file 200.  
 
 NOIS:  SBY-1296-30637
 AFJXADHD - It was reported that the security alert bulletin on sensitive
            data access occasionally was not generated. A secondary
            access path was discovered through routine AFJXADHD. AFJXADHD
            is now modified to handle the generation of bulletins the
            same as in routine AFJXALRT (which was previously modified to
            handle this problem).
 
 NOIS:  DAY-0297-40622
 AFJXADHD and AFJXALRT - Dayton reported that a spurious global node 
            ^AFJ(537000,-1,0) was being set when a FILE^DICN failed and 
            S DA=+Y returned a -1. Then S ^AFJ(537000,DA,1) was performed.
            A condition was added in routines AFJXADHD and AFJXALRT to
            that SET to make it S:DA&gt;0 and thus corrected the problem.  
 
 NOIS:  DAY-0197-40124
 AFJXWCPM - A site has reported a problem with BOLD being undefined at
            line OPTION in routine AFJXWCPM. This results from IOST(0)
            either being undefined or set to null.
            Examination shows that in such cases BOLD and BOLF are
            equally apt to cause problems. The modification made to clear
            this problem is to hard SET BOLD and BOLF to null before
            IOST(0) is checked and BOLD and BOLF are updated.
 
 NOIS:  HOU-0197-72340
 AFJXWPR2 - Houston reported that there was a syntax error in 
            routine AFJXWPR2 that caused problems with SOAP entries. This
            is corrected.
 
 PATCH HISTORY: 
 ==============
 
    The AFJXPNHX changes in this patch were originally issued as 
    AFJX*5.1*5 which was declared to have been 'Entered in Error' due
    to an error in selection of routines contained (NOIS CIN-0397-40969).
 
    This has been updated correctly in AFJX*5.1*6.  
 
    In the previous AFJX patches, the Patch to Package file link was not 
    included. As a result, the package patch history is incomplete. The 
    sites are requested to manually update the patch history in the 
    Package File to indicate that patches 1 through 3 for AFJX are entered
    into the production routines. Patches 4 and 5 were declared to have 
    been 'Entered in Error,' hence need not be entered.  (This patch will
    update the package patch history for AFJX*5.1*6 only.)

     To test if the transport has been corrupted, you can use the 
     "Verify Package Integrity" option.  This option is under Utilities 
     under the KIDS menu.  It will compare the checksums in the build 
     with the current checksums and list any that differ. 
 
  Environmental Check Routine 
  ===========================
   
    The environmental check routine is AFJXEN6 which checks the version 
    and patch levels of the NHE package installed. Routine AFJXEN6 may be 
    removed by the station upon successful installation of this patch.  
   
Installation Instructions: 
==========================
 
    WHEN? Anytime. This patch is so brief (only seven routines) that it 
    should not be queued.  
   
    HOW LONG?  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  
 
       Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan and respond 
       YES at the prompt 'Want to Continue with load?  YES// &lt;return&gt;.  
                                                       ===
 
    1. Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.  
    2. It is not necessary to place TaskMan in a WAIT/STOP state.  
    3. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
       and Protocols? Yes// &lt;return&gt;, respond YES or &lt;return&gt;. When
                                              ===
       prompted to select the option(s) you would like to place out of

          ================
          AFJX PURGE NIGHTLY 
          ==================
 
    4. Review your Mapped Routine set. If any of the routines listed in 
       the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped on your system, they 
       should be unmapped at this time.     
    5. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.  This 
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
    6. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your 
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
    7. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu. On the KIDS Installation menu, you may elect
       to use the following options: 
       a. Verify checksums in the Transport Global - this option will 
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in 
          the Transport Global.  
       b. Compare Transport Global to the Current System - this option 
          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when the 
          patch is installed. It compares all components of the patch 
          (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).  
       c. Back up a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT 
          back up any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
          Use the Install Package(s) options and select the package: 
 
          AFJX*5.1*6.

Subject: Missing and undefined data
 
Category: 
  - Routine
 
Description: 
============
 
     2 routines (AFJXPNHI, AFJXWCPL) are modified in this patch.
   
   
Prerequisites:
==============
 
      Install patch AFJX*5.1*6 prior to the installation of this patch.
 
 
NOIS:
====
 
NOIS:  MIW-0397-31028
AFJXWCPL - An uncoordinated addition of a new cross-reference in Lab
Package resulted in an undefined at NXTST+2^AFJXWCPL. The code at
CHSET+7 was modified to exclude the handling of the new
cross-reference.
 
NOIS:  CLL-0397-42751
AFJXPNHI - The variable I was reported to be undefined at
PART2^AFJXPNHI. This variable was used as a dummy index for a For
Loop and was not used elsewhere. The For Loop was changed to an
argumentless one.
 
NOIS:  DAN-0497-41347
AFJXPNHI - The site was reporting that NHE reports were not being
found by the alerts mechanism. Investigation found two problems.
 
The first was that the parsing mechanism that parsed the titles in
the Alerts Message was using spaces in locating data. Since the
spaces were used the data after the patient name was mis-parsed if
there was a third item present in the name (such as Jr/Sr. a number,
etc). The code in AFJXPNHI was modified to use other characteristics
to allow a proper parsing.
 
The second is that if the patients name is spelled differently at
the server and client the Alerts will not display the messages since
a built in check (the two names are the same) fails. Since this is a
design feature a decision or how to handle this is still open
(Follow the completed reports model where this is available, or
extend the security to the complete report).

    To test if the transport has been corrupted, you can use the
    "Verify Package Integrity" option.  This option is under
    Utilities under the KIDS menu.  It will compare the checksums in
    the build with the current checksums and list any that differ.
 
Environment Check Routine:
=========================
 
    The routine AFJXEN7 checks to see if NHE version 5.1 with patch
    6 is installed before installation proceeds. On failure, a
    message is sent to the user detailing the problems encountered.
    The routine AFJXEN7 may be removed upon successful patch 7
    installation.
 
 
Installation Instructions:
==========================
 
    WHEN? Anytime. This patch is so brief (only two routines) that it
    should not be queued.
 
    HOW LONG?  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
 
       Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan and respond
       YES at the prompt 'Want to Continue with load?  YES// &lt;return&gt;.
                                                       ===
 
    1. Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.
    2. It is not necessary to place TaskMan in a WAIT/STOP state.
    3. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
       and Protocols? Yes// &lt;return&gt;, respond YES. When prompted
                                              ===
       to select the option(s) you would like to place out of order,
       enter the following:
 
          AFJXNHEX REQUEST
          ================
 
    4. Review your Mapped Routine set. If any of the routines listed in
       the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped on your system, they
       should be unmapped at this time.
    5. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
    6. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
    7. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu. On the KIDS Installation menu, you may
       elect to use the following options:
       a. Verify checksums in the Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the Transport Global.
       b. Compare Transport Global to the Current System - this option
          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when the
          patch is installed. It compares all components of the patch
          (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
       c. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
          Use the Install Package(s) options and select the package:
 
          AFJX*5.1*7.
          ==========
 
    8. If the routines were unmapped as part of step 4, they should be
       returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
       completion.

   Resolving truncation of data
 
 
 Category:
  - Routine
 
 
 Description:
 ============
     Results of a lab test performed at the site are obtained via
  Network Health Exchange.  NHE has been providing only 4 digits
  instead of 6 digits or more.  This patch will rectify this
  truncation of data.
 
     Facilities should undertake a review of whether clinicians
  have looked up viral load results using NHE, and whether
  clinical judgments have been based on these values rather than
  looking up the results in VistA directly.  If this has happened
  then it must be determined whether a patient's treatment
  protocol is accurate and that the laboratory values were not
  truncated resulting in inappropriate treatment.  Corrective
  actions should be taken immediately.
 
 
 NOIS:  CIN-0698-41578
     Delay in the treatment of a patient being followed in
  the Extended Infectious Disease Clinic at a tertiary VISN
  facility.  Patient was prescribed a single antiretroviral
  medication based on a viral load value of 3,090 obtained
  through the Network Health Exchange (NHE).  Three
  antiretroviral agents should have been prescribed based on
  the actual value of 30,090. The NHE viral load value field
  only allowed for a 4 digit value to be transmitted, when in
  fact, the value is often 6 digits long or more.

    Network Health Exchange interface with Health Summary
 
 
 Category:
    Routine
 
 
 Description:
 ============
 
    This patch provides for NHE to call into the Health Summary
    package and retrieve the same information and display the
    same data to the NHE users as provided by Health Summary.
 
    This patch makes the software Health Summary and Y2K
    compliant.
 
    Since this software now uses the spooling device, it is
    important to note that a spool device to which Health
    Summary output may be directed, should be entered in the
    Health Summary Parameters File (142.99).  The spooling
    device should be a legal device in the Device File which
    points to a directory and file on the host system.
 
    AFJXADD1 - routine to put 3 additional Type entries (Current
    Order, Surgery Non Or Procedures &amp; Compensation &amp; Pension
    Exams) into file #537015.
 
    This patch will delete all the NHE routines that are no
    longer used for collecting data.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
 
   1. Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation;
      however, it is highly recommended to do the installation
      when a minimal number of users are on the system.
   2. It is not necessary to place TaskMan in a WAIT/STOP state.
   3. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
      and Protocols? Yes// &lt;return&gt;, respond YES. When prompted to select
                                             ===
      the option(s) you would like to place out of order, enter the
      following:
 
         AFJXNHEX REQUEST
         ================
 
   4. Review your Mapped Routine set. If any of the routines listed in
      the ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped on your system, they
      should be unmapped at this time.
   5. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.  This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
   6. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
   7. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu,
      select the Installation menu. On the KIDS Installation menu,
      you may elect to use the following options:
      a. Verify checksums in the Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the Transport Global.
      b. Print Transport Global and Compare Transport Global to the
         Current System - this option will allow you to view all
         changes that will be made when the patch is installed. It
         compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
         templates, etc.).
      c. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
         Use the Install Package(s) options and select the package:
 
         AFJX*5.1*15.
         ===========
 
   8. If the routines were unmapped as part of step 4, the mapped set
      should be rebuilt once the installation has run to completion.
 
 
   9. The following routines would automatically be deleted:

        Since Network Health Exchange has interfaced
        with Health Summary package, the information
        indicating that NHE is running independently
        with HS is considered invalid.  Modified
        routine AFJXWCPM to delete this information.

     NOIS: NAS-0700-32185, TAM-0600-30805
         It was reported that there were times that sites
     had received incorrect data for a patient; however,
     when the user tries to make another NHE request for the
     same patient, the user gets the correct result.
     This problem is intermittent.  Routines were modified
     to ensure that data being transferred from the spooler
     would be unique for each patient.

Description:

      NOIS FAR-1200-40490 
              Fargo VAMC reported that they have received data on
      the wrong patient when they received NHE requests from
      Minneapolis. This patch will install a patient
      identification filter (PATID) that will match the patient
      identity on each Health Summary segment with the patient
      identifier (Name, Date of birth, Social Security Number) of
      the patient requested. If any of the Health Summary
      segments do not return data for the patient requested, then
      none of the data will be returned to the requestor. A
      message that instructs the requestor to resend the request
      is sent instead.
 
        This patch also includes an option for the receiving site
      that will report on the number of possible bad data
      messages that have been received by the site.
 
        This option works by comparing the patient's age with the
      age calculated from the Date of Birth that was reported in
      the Demographics segment of the NHE request. Note that if
      the request is made within a few weeks of the patient's
      birthday, and the age calculated by the Date of Birth
      differs by one year from the patient's actual age, then
      this report option may falsly indicate that the record was
      invalid when in fact it was valid (data is for the correct
      patient).
 
        Since the server filter uses three data elements (Name,
      Social Security Number, and Date of birth), it is much more
      accurate than the report option at catching NHE data
      messages for the wrong patient. If the server site has
      loaded this patch then you can assume that the patient is
      correct regardless of what this report displays.
 
        How to tell if the server site has loaded this patch:
 
        Messages will have a line inserted after the patient ID:

Patch AFJX*5.1*30

This patch fixes some problems in patch AFJX*5.1*26.
 
NOIS FTL-0701-51047
Test Site: Charleston, SC
The mail group AFJX PATID FILTER BLOCK should be PUBLIC.  The pre-init
in this patch checks for the existence of the mail group.  If it's not
there, it creates it.  If it is there, it makes sure it's defined
correctly.  The person who installs this patch is added as a member.
You are free to change the ORGANIZER, COORDINATOR, and MEMBER fields
afterwards.  Here's the group:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME: AFJX PATID FILTER BLOCK           TYPE: public
  COORDINATOR: &lt;someone&gt;
MEMBER: &lt;someone&gt;
DESCRIPTION:   If the patient ID filter blocks an incoming data request
because it detected possible invalid health summary data, a warning is sent
to members of this group.
  ORGANIZER: &lt;someone&gt;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOIS CHA-0701-30431, TOG-0701-10186
Test Site: Charleston, SC
The option AFJX PATID REPORT is included to correct any omissions.
Here's the option:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME: AFJX PATID REPORT
 MENU TEXT: Network Health Exchange Check Messages
 TYPE: run routine                     CREATOR: &lt;someone&gt;
 PACKAGE: NETWORK HEALTH EXCHANGE
DESCRIPTION:   This option goes through all the messages in the Mailbox
belonging to NETWORK,HEALTH EXCHANGE, and checks to see if any contain "bad
data".  Among the things checked is patient age, in an attempt to ensure
that the message contains data from the correct requested patient.
 
A report on the results is produced.
 
Note that this option is only needed to check messages received at your site
before you installed patch AFJX*5.1*26.  Messages received afterwards are
checked as they are received.
 ROUTINE: AFJXVER
 UPPERCASE MENU TEXT: NETWORK HEALTH EXCHANGE CHECK

Patch AFJX*5.1*31

NOIS TUC-1001-60741, TUC-1001-60737, HUN-0701-22217, DAY-0797-41839,
     HVH-1000-12729, HOU-0801-70115, COA-1201-22358, WPB-1201-31089
Test Site: Huntington, WV; Houston, TX

This patch does the following:

- Prevents NHE from accepting requests from or sending requests to closed
sites.  (See NOIS TUC-1001-60741, TUC-1001-60737, COA-1201-22358,
WPB-1201-31089, and HUN-0701-22217.)  Any closed sites in file 537025,
NHE AUTHORIZED SITES file, will be ignored, and will not be selectable
when requests are being created.

- Solves the undefined BOLD variable problem by no longer "bolding" output
on the menu.  (See NOIS DAY-0797-41839.)

- Solves the problem which occurred when Hudson Valley HCS changed option
S.AFJXSERVER to use a resource device to limit it to running only one job
at a time.  (See NOIS HVH-1000-12729.)

Additionally,
- Routines are rewritten to incorporate good programming practices.
- Routine AFJXVER is modified to check both the B and C xrefs in file 4.2,
instead of just the B xref, when looking up a domain name.
- Routine AFJXPNHX is modified to use MailMan APIs to delete messages from
the NHE user's mailbox, instead of using direct global edits.
- The Identifiers in file 537000 are changed to "Write" Identifiers.  The
Post-Init, ^AFJXPRE, will effect the change.
- The DDs of fields in files 537000 and 537025, which are free-text domain
names, are changed to pointer-type fields, pointing to file 4.2.  The DD
of the field in file 537010 which points to file 537025 is changed to
point to file 4.2.  It is necessary to do this because domain names can,
and do, change. The Post-Init, ^AFJXPRE, will go through the records in
those files and change the data in the affected fields to pointers to file
4.2.  It will take approximately 1/2 hour for every 400,000 records in file
^AFJ(537010.  Here are the new definitions for the affected fields:

Patch AFJX*5.1*32
 
NOIS CAH-0602-31615 (Remedy Ticket HD8220/CHG2653)
Test Site: Central Alabama HCS; Birmingham, AL

If the NETWORK,HEALTH EXCHANGE user has been terminated, the requesting
user never sees the results of a query after processing the alert.  This
patch makes it possible for the requesting user to see the results.

Instead of sending two messages in response to a user query (one with the
requested information to the NETWORK,HEALTH EXCHANGE user; the other to a
server which alerts the requesting user to it), this patch sends just one
message to both.  The process is thus simplified.

The two-message process also sometimes causes problems because of timing
issues.  A user can be alerted that the request has been completed, but
when the user tries to view the results, it can't be found.  This is
because MailMan hasn't yet delivered the first message to the
NETWORK,HEALTH EXCHANGE user.  This patch and its one-message process
makes it impossible for this to happen.

NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
is at a minimum.  It requires patch AFJX*5.1*31.

Patch AFJX*5.1*33
 
NOIS: FNC-0103-30068
Test Site: Fayetteville, NC

If the NETWORK,HEALTH EXCHANGE user has been terminated, requests that
users make are not delivered to the NETWORK,HEALTH EXCHANGE user.
Consequently, it is not possible to print or view completed requests
which were made after termination.  In order to remedy this, a check will
be made of the status of the NETWORK,HEALTH EXCHANGE user every time a
user enters option AFJXNHEX REQUEST (Network Health Exchange Options ...),
and if the NETWORK,HEALTH EXCHANGE user is terminated, the option will not
be usable.

Patch AFJX*5.1*34
 
NOIS: TOM-0303-40892
Test Site: Tomah, WI

At some prompts, there are no time-outs.  At other prompts, time-outs may
result in infinite prompt loops.  This patch fixes that.

This patch also deletes obsolete routines:
AFJXADD1, AFJXPNHF, AFJXPNHI, AFJXREW, AFJXWCBP, AFJXWCPB, AFJXWCPD, AFJXWCPY

This patch also changes the check for a printer from IOST["C-" to
$E(IOST,1,2)="C-".

is at a minimum.  It requires patch AFJX*5.1*33.

Patch AFJX*5.1*35
 
NOIS: WRJ-0403-11925, SFC-0403-61371
Test Sites: White River Junction, VT; San Francisco VAMC; Erie, PA

The problem concerns the following menu in option [AFJXNHEX REQUEST]
Network Health Exchange Options:

VistA Network Health Exchange Menu            TRUSTED,USER
=====================================================================
     Select one of the following:

          1         Brief (12 months) Medical Record Information
          2         Total Medical Record Information
          3         Brief (12 months) Pharmacy Information
          4         Total Pharmacy Information
          5         Print (Completed Requests Only)
          6         Print By Type of Information (Completed Requests)

Option #6 chops off "Discharge Summary" and "Progress Notes" before
displaying them completely.  They can be fully seen in option #5.
This patch fixes the problem.

As an added bonus, we are adding a cross reference to the NAME (#.01)
field of the VAMC NETWORK HEALTH TYPES (#537015) file.  The new C cross
reference will be all upper-case, so that the user doesn't have to enter
the exact mixed case component name during ^DIC lookups.  The post-init,
POST^AFJXYP35, will create the new cross reference.
