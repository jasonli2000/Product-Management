<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This build includes changes to address problems where Provider
Comments were being inappropriately copied from one order to another.
 
Changes are included in PSIVORA1 to prevent the variable ON55 from
remaining in the partition after taking action on an IV Fluid order
through OE/RR 2.5. This allowed the Provider Comments from the order
defined by ON55 to be copied into new orders under certain conditions.
 
Changes are included in PSGMIV, PSGMMIV, PSGMMIVC, and PSJMIV to prevent
the Provider Comments from a recently edited order from being added to an
order currently being edited. This would occur only if the user edited an
order containing Provider Comments, queued an MAR that included that
order, and then edited another order at the exact moment when the 1st
order is printed on the MAR.

This build will fix the problems reported below:
 
1) Extra Units Dispensed Report [PSJU EUDD] including information outside
of the date range. (MGY-0996-31463)
 
2) Unable to enter units dispensed using Enter Units Dispensed [PSJU PLDP]
for pick lists with a future start date/time when all pick list except
ones with a future start date/time have been filed away. (LAK-0696-30468)
 
3) Divide by Zero error at MN+1^PSGPL0. This error occurs
when field #42 (FREQUENCY) of the sub file Unit Dose (#55.06) of
the Pharmacy Patient File (#55) is a zero. (CON-0796-10063,
WHC-0795-10480)
 
4) Pick List hangs when sent to ATC.  The site has the parameter ATC SORT
PARAMETER=ADMIN TIME, the orders causing the pick list to hang are orders
with a schedule type of On Call which have no admin times.
(WNY-0197-12396)
 
5) Pick List not calculating correct units needed when orders have a
non-standard schedule (e.g. QAM&amp;NOON). (CTX-0996-70760, NCH-0197-42095)
Another problem reported was when the schedule q.0.d was entered, where
zero is entered instead of the letter o, the software would get stuck in a
loop. (MAT-1294-70289)

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch will remove the references to the following files:
PROVIDER (#16)
PERSON (#6)
USER (#3)
 
Once this patch is installed the option [PSJV PROVIDER PRINT] Active
Provider Report will no longer be available.  This option was provided to
assist sites in making the transition from using the PROVIDER file (#6) to
using the NEW PERSON file (#200) by identifying providers from file 6 and
listing their inactivation date from file 6, inactivation date from file
200, and if the provider was authorized to write med. orders in file 200.

The "APSJD" cross-reference on DATE OF DEATH field (#.351) of the PATIENT
file (#2) calls routine PSJADT, which leaves the local variable D0
undefined.  The San Francisco Office of the Chief Information Officer
(OCIO) Field Office requested that D0, D1, and D2 be added to the list of
variables NEWed at line END+1.
 
The FileMan compatibility issue centers around the variable D0 being
defined.  Cross-references may set D0 equal to DA but should not otherwise
alter ordelete D0.  This issue has not been documented in the past but
surfaced with the Merge testing.
 
Merge is tentatively scheduled for national release in August, 1997.

 1. A problem was discovered during the installation of Inpatient
Medications V. 5.0 at a test site where IV orders had a status of DC'ed in
Pharmacy, but had a future stop date and a status of active in Order
Entry/Results Reporting (OE/RR). This was found to be the result of a call
made to DCOR^PSIVACT by the Surgery package.  There is an existing
integration agreement with Surgery to allow them to call this entry point.
However, the entry point was never updated to call OE/RR to change the
order's stop date and status.
 
 2. An additional problem was discovered at one of our V. 5.0 test sites.
When a patient had only IV orders and these orders were auto discontinued
due to a patient movement and the movement was later deleted, the IV
orders were not auto reinstated.

A problem was reported with the default Start/Stop date/time on IV
orders logged in between midnight and 12:30AM.  On an order with a
schedule of NOW that was logged in at 00:09 the Start Date and the Stop
Date showed 1699 for the default.  On an order with a schedule of Q6HR
that was logged in at 00:10 the Start Date showed a default of 1699 and
the Stop Date showed a default of JAN 7,1841 24:00.
 
When an order entered thru Order Entry by a Provider was finished by
pharmacy, the default Start Date came up as "1699" and the default Stop
Date was Jan 14, 1841  24:00. This error occurs when log in time is the

*  The mail message will contain the patient's name, last four digits of
the patient's social security number, current ward location, reason the

Decision Support System (DSS) software has made provisions for inclusion
of the stop code field from outpatient clinic's intravenous dispensing
when it is available.  The stop code is derived by DSS from the clinic
location field.  Inpatient Medications V. 4.5 is being modified to pass
the clinic location field to DSS.
 
The Inpatient Medications software currently passes intravenous dispensing
data to DSS for DSS extraction, but does not include the clinic location
field.  The passing of this data occurs when an IV label is printed or it
is returned after the label is printed.
 
DSS loads this data into a DSS file for later extraction by the vendor.
With the installation of this patch, Inpatient Medications V. 4.5 will
begin prompting for the CLINIC LOCATION for Outpatient IV orders entered
from the Inpatient Medications package, storing the clinic location with
the order as it is entered through either Order Entry/Results Reporting
(OE/RR) or Inpatient Medications, and passing this data, when available,
to DSS.

1. Patch PSJ*4.5*66 added the institution name to several reports as
requested in E3R #11366.  For integrated sites the institution name
appearing on the reports was the primary institution's name.  After
installation of this patch integrated sites will see the name which was
entered in field INTEGRATED SITE NAME (#17000) from the STATION NUMBER
(TIME SENSITIVE) file (#389.9) on these reports. There will be no change
for non-integrated sites.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
1. A problem was reported at a site when the physician used the
non-standard schedule of QH during order entry. The system would hang and
IRM would have to go in and off the job. A routine change corrects this
problem.
 
2. A problem was found where an Illegal Number error could occur in PSGDS0
when an Authorized Absence/Discharge Summary was generated. The error
would occur only if the patient for which the report was being generated
was assigned to a room-bed named numberEnumber-number. This problem also
existed in previous versions of Inpatient Medications. Changes are
included to correct this error.
 
3. An undefined error at NEWIV+4^PSJORUT2 can occur when multiple
solutions are entered for a Hyperal type IV order. This patch will correct
this error.
 
4. When there are multiple duplicate drugs found while entering a new
order, the duplicate drugs scroll off the screen.  A pause was added so
the user will have a chance to see the warning.
 
5. When an IV order had been renewed through Computerized Patient Record
System , the admin time from the original order should be copied over to
the new order. This will now function the same as Unit Dose.
 
6. When the IV order's login time is the same as the admin time, the start
date of the order was not calculated in the correct format (West Palm
Beach reported this). When the login time is between midnight and 12:30
and the schedule is now, the start time was not calculated in the correct
format. This patch will correct this problem.
 
7. The MAR sometimes printed the pharmacy tech's initials for IV orders.
The MAR will now print the initials of the person who completed the IV
order.
 
8. A change was made to print the &lt;A&gt; on the right of the patient name and
ward to indicate the patient has verified or non-verified allergy/adverse
reactions.
 
9. When a field is edited in a non-verified Unit Dose order that does not
cause a new order to be created, the order was not redisplayed for
verification. This patch will cause the non-verified orders to be
redisplayed after editing a field that does not cause a new order to be
created.
 
10. When a pending Unit Dose order with a priority of STAT was displayed
on the Unit Dose profile the "-&gt;" was not shown next to the order number
identifying the order as not verified. This patch will cause the "-&gt;" to
be displayed for pending stat orders.
 
11. San Francisco reported an illegal or invalid argument at
EDIT+2^PSIVEDT. This error occurred when the Med route field was edited.
Routine PSIVEDT was changed to correct this error.

1. An error would occur when printing a MAR label through CPRS if the
order contained missing data. This patch will prevent this error. (NOIS
CTX-0198-71417) 
 
2. If a Unit Dose order had a Schedule that contained "PRN", the Schedule
type would automatically default to CONTINUOUS if the user was using the
Abbreviated Order Entry process.  This patch will change the default
Schedule Type to PRN if the order's schedule contains "PRN".
 
3. When using Inpatient Order Entry, the user should not be allowed to
finish an order entered as an IV Fluid in Unit Dose.  This patch will
prevent Fluid orders from being transferred to Unit Dose during the finish
process.  
 
4. A change was made to prevent the deletion of a dispense drug from an
active unit dose order.  The user may enter an inactive date for the
dispense drug that is no longer to be used.
 
5. When editing the SELF MED prompt for an order, an undefined error would
occur if the user entered "1" instead of "Y" for yes.  The software will
now recognize "1" for YES and "0" for NO at this prompt.
 
6. An error was occurring when the user entered a leading zero when
choosing fields 1-9 in a Unit Dose order. This patch will prevent this
occurence. (NOIS SFC-0198-61889, SFC-0198-61890)
 
7. In the Inpatient Medications 5.0 KIDS build, three routines were
mistakenly left out of this build.  PSJORMA1,PSJORMA2, and PSJORMAR are
correctly reinstalled by this patch. (NOIS CTX-0398-70640)

This patch includes routines, options, and partial Data Dictionary
components that address Software Quality Assurance issues found for
version 5. This patch corrects these issues.
 
 
Some of the QA issues resolved:
 
- Removal of nonstandard reference to global ^DISV(.
- Removal of nonstandard reference to global ^XUTL(.
- Removal of nonstandard reference to global ^DGPM(.
- Write commands in the Data Dictionary were converted to EN^DDIOL calls.
- Removal of variable kills of % variables.
- Variable DT sets were changed to supported $$DT^XLFDT calls.
- References to ^DD were changed to FileMan supported D FIELD^DID calls.
- Many routines that are no longer used were deleted in the Version 5.0
 install.  This patch deletes the corresponding options.
- Removal of nonstandard reference to ^DIC(9.4. These were changed to
 supported $$VERSION^XPDUTL calls.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. In Inpatient Medications V. 4.5 and Order Entry Results Reporting
(OERR) V. 2.5, orders for outpatient IVs could be entered for a patient in
OERR. These IV orders were then finished in pharmacy.  If a Unit Dose
order was mistakenly entered for an Outpatient, the pharmacist would
notice this and discontinue the order. In Inpatient Medications V. 5.0,
the pharmacist can no longer Discontinue these erroneous Outpatient Unit
Dose orders.
 
2. This patch allows the installer to queue a background task that
searches for Unit Dose orders that were entered for outpatients through
OERR V. 2.5. The orders would normally be discontinued if the patient is
admitted again. This task finds the patients that have never admitted
again since these orders were entered. The pending orders will have their
status changed to Discontinued.
 
3. A second job is also queued for the same time that corrects a problem
found in the Unit Dose Verification fields cross-references in the
NON-VERIFIED ORDERS file (#53.1).  Some orders that were verified by a
Pharmacist or Nurse were not having the corresponding Pharmacist or Nurse
cross-reference set correctly for the order.  This task will go through
these cross-references checking each one.  When one is found to be
erroneous it will be corrected.
 
4. This patch also includes a change to correct an error that can occur
during the Pick List Conversion.  Changes were made to prevent bad pick
list entries from causing an error when the pick list is reindexed.  When
the pick list is purged, the bad entries will be deleted.
 
NOTE: You will see the KIDS Install question only if the Computerized
Patient Record System (CPRS) Patient Order conversion has finished.  These
two tasks can only run after the CPRS Order conversion has completed. This
can be checked by D STATUS^OR3CONV1. If the CPRS Order conversion has not
finished, the post install routine for this patch will not run.  The
change to routine PSJIPST3 will allow these two tasks to be queued up
automatically when the CPRS conversion finishes.
 
It is recommended that this job be queued to run at a non-peak hour.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. This patch makes changes to print a four digit year on all MARS, Action
profile 1 and 2, and Authorized Absense/Discharge Summary report.  This
action is taken to prepare for the year 2000.
 
2. A problem was reported in Inpatient Medications version 4.5 for the
Action Profile #1 report. If only five or six orders printed for a
patient, extra lines didn't print in the "Additional Medication Orders"
section for the physician to enter notes or additional orders.  This patch
will correct this for Inpatient Medications version 5.0.
 
3. An undefined variable error was occurring on the Action Profile #1
report if the patient didn't have a room/bed assignment.  This patch makes
a change to routine PSGAP0 to correct this.
 
4. A problem was reported on the 14 Day MAR report.  If MARs for multiple
patients were being printed, the patient's initials in the order label
were sometimes printing incorrectly.  This patch makes a change to routine
PSGMAR1 and PSGMMAR1 to correct this.
 
5. A problem was reported that after installation of Adverse Reaction
Tracking patch GMRA*4*10, the No Known Allergies (NKA) message was not
printing correctly on the MAR sheets.  This patch makes a change so that
the NKA message will print appropriately with or without GMRA*4*10 being
installed.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. If an order contained a dispense drug marked as inactive in the DRUG
file (#50), a message stating "(ONE OR ALL DISPENSE DRUGS ARE CURRENTLY
LISTED AS INACTIVE OR DO NOT MATCH THE ORDERABLE ITEM FOR THIS ORDER.)"
was displayed twice. This patch eliminates this message and instead
displays "INVALID DISPENSE DRUG" or "INVALID ORDERABLE ITEM" in the
message field of the order display. 
 
 
2. If a dispense drug was assigned a past inactive date in a Unit Dose
order, it was still checked for validity. After installing this patch
drugs marked as inactive within an order are not checked.
 
 
3. If a pharmacist or nurse who had AUTO-VERIFY disabled renewed a Unit
Dose order, the order was created as non-verified. This patch will cause
orders created due to renew by a pharmacist or nurse in pharmacy to be
created as active. 
 
4. An error would occur if an order containing an inactive dispense drug
was completed using the Speed Finish action in pharmacy. This patch
eliminates the error. 
 
 
5. A ListMan variable (VALMCNT) was getting killed during the Patient
Record Update action on a patient's profile screen.  If the profile had
more that one screen, upon exiting the Patient Record Update edit the
profile screen length would be incorrectly reduced.
 
 
6. When the user chose a range of orders to finish from any profile
screen a "^" or "^^" entered at any order would not let the user exit from
this list.  A change was made to ensure that the user can exit at any time
from their chosen list of orders by entering "^^" or "^".
 
 
7. If an order entered through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)
met the criteria:
a) The Orderable Item has a default Schedule Type entered. 
b) An order entered through CPRS contains "PRN" in the SCHEDULE field.
When this order was finished the SCHEDULE field containing "PRN" was
causing the default Schedule Type from the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file
(#50.7) to be overwritten with a Schedule Type of "PRN".  This patch will
correct this.
 
 
8. An error occurred when a "-" character was entered at the
Administration time prompt when finishing an order.  
 
 
9. A problem occurred when a user's INPATIENT PROFILE ORDER SORT parameter
was set to START DATE OF ORDER.  Orders that were pending renewals could
not be chosen correctly from the profile for Speed Finish.
 
 
10. A change was made that displays all order check descriptions from CPRS
on the screen when finishing an IV order.
 
 
11. When finishing a Unit Dose pending order, the Comments field is not
displayed on the screen.  This patch will display the Comments field and
allow user to edit this field while finishing order.
 
 
12. If a non-verified Unit Dose order was edited by a pharmacist and MAR
labels were to be generated, an incorrect ^(7) node would be created in
the NON-VERIFIED ORDERS file (#53.1). Also, the label generated for the
new order would show a reason of "ORDER" instead of "NEW ORDER (EDIT)".
This patch corrects these problems and deletes the erroneous ^(7) nodes.
 
13. When finishing a Unit Dose pending order without a dispense drug, the
user can only enter one dispense drug and must edit the order to enter
extra dispense drug.  This patch will allow user to enter multiple
dispense drugs without having to edit the order.
 
14. Variable XT was undefined when finishing an IV pending order.  This
patch will correct this problem.

1. A request was made to change the default to "No" for the prompt "Is 
the Formulary Alternative acceptable".  This will prevent the order 
from being finished if an accidental return is hit for this prompt.
 
 
2. A change was made to incorporate the expansion text of a schedule 
in the Special Instructions for an order.  If the schedule has an 
expansion text and is used in the Special Instructions, it will now be
displayed in the Special Instructions.
 
 
3. A change was made to correct an undefined variable error that 
could occur when the protocol PSJ OR PAT PR (Inpatient Medications 
Profile) was accessed from the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)
options.
 
 
4. A change was made to display the possible IV Identifier when 
choosing Orderable Items on the Patients on Specific Drug(s) and the 
Drug (Cost and/or Amount) reports.
 
 
5. The option CAtegory File (IV) [PSJI IVCATEGORY] was mistakenly 
removed from the SUPervisor's Menu (IV) [PSJI SUPERVISOR] menu 
for Inpatient Medications 5.0.  This option will be reinstalled in this 
patch.
 
 
6. A change was made on the Action Profile reports.  If the IV order 
contains no additives, a blank line will print for the additive and the 
solutions will print on the following line.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. This patch corrects a problem where the current date/time was used to
calculate the default start date/time when the order was speed finished by
pharmacy. These changes will cause the login date/time of the first order 
selected in the group to be finished to be used instead.  
 
2. An error would sometimes occur when renewing a Unit Dose order if the
Orderable Item for the order contained a day or dose limit. These changes
will prevent the error and allow the day/dose limit entered to be used in
calculating the stop date for the new renewal order.  
 
3. A problem was found where a expired renewed order could be listed on
the pick list and then again if an update was run for that pick list. If a
Unit Dose order was renewed with a future start date the original order
would be shown on the pick list as expired and then again as expired if an
update was run for that pick list. This patch will cause the order to only
be listed on the original pick list.
 
4. A problem was found where the previous order number was not returned to
Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) when a pending Inpatient Med
order was edited by pharmacy during the finish process. This change will
cause the previous order number to be returned in all situations where a
new order is created due to edit by pharmacy.
 
5. This patch corrects an error which would occur when a pharmacy
supported reference call was invoked by the CPRS Graphic User Interface
(GUI). After installation of this patch the call to TERM^VALM0 will not be
performed if the call was issued by the Broker.
 
6. If the Dosage Ordered field is edited on an active order and the user
just hits &lt;RET&gt; and didn't change the value, the order would incorrectly
be flagged as having a change and a new order would be created.  This
patch will correct this problem.
 
7. CPRS requested that the order control code be changed from OC to UR
when an order cannot be removed from hold through CPRS. This change will
allow CPRS to display the reason the action could not be taken to the
user.

1. A problem was reported with the LABEL PRINTER field (#.07) in the
INPATIENT USER PARAMETERS file (#53.45), WARD LABEL PRINTER field (#.13)
and PHARMACY LABEL PRINTER field (#.14) in the INPATIENT WARD PARAMETERS
file (#59.6), and the BAXTER ATC DEVICE field (#30) in the WARD GROUP file
(#57.5).  These fields store the name of entries in the DEVICE file
(#3.5).  The fields currently have the data type of Free Text.  This
causes problems if the device name is ever changed in the DEVICE file
(#3.5).  Until the new name is entered into these fields in the Inpatient
Medications package, the pharmacy order labels will not print or Pick
Lists will not be sent correctly to the ATC device.  
 
This patch will create and populate new fields that are Pointer data types
by converting the old device names stored in the old fields to their
internal entry values in the DEVICE file (#3.5).  This will permit the
device names to be changed without any disruption to the printing of
pharmacy labels.  
 
2. A change to address NOIS WNY-0197-12396 was not included in version
5.0.  The ATC-212 device will hang if an 'ON CALL' order is sent to it.
This was reported in NOIS WNY-0598-10164.  This patch will make the
correct change to routine PSGTAP1 and PSGPLR.

This patch adds functionality requested in E3R #9551.    
 
When the Patient Information Management System (PIMS) deletes a patient
movement, the medication orders that were discontinued due to the deletion
are automatically reinstated.  A mail message will be sent to notify
affected parties that a patient's medications have been reinstated.
Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 has been modified to include this
functionality.     
 
* A mail group named PSJ-ORDERS REINSTATED is created by the patch KIDS
build.  The members of this mail group should be providers, nurses,
pharmacist, etc. who need to know that the patient's medication orders
have been automatically reinstated.  
 
*  When the medication orders are automatically reinstated due to deletion
of a patient movement, a mail message will be sent to the PSJ-ORDERS
REINSTATED mail group.  
 
*  The mail message will contain the patient's name, last four digits of
the patient's social security number, current ward location, reason the
orders were reinstated, and a list of orders that were reinstated. The
orders will be listed in the mail message in exact format as a patient

1.  An error was reported that occurred when a unit dose order set was
being entered.  A variable was not being cleaned up between the processing
of one order to the next in the order set.  If the user edited a field but
didn't change the value, this variable would cause an error when the
following order in the set was being processed.  This patch makes a change
to routine PSGOES to correct this error.  
 
2.  A problem was found where a single or leading space was being entered
in the schedule field of a Unit Dose order through Computerized Patient
Record System (CPRS) and pharmacy. These changes prevent the entry of
these in the schedule field through pharmacy and will reject any orders
sent from CPRS with these type of schedules.
 
3.  The ONE-TIME/PRN MAR prints 10 blank lines for initials and notes at
bottom half of the MAR sheet.  At the sites request, this patch will print
20 blank lines as in previous version of Inpatient Medications.
 
4. A problem was reported with Service (Total Cost per) [PSJU SCT]
report.  Patch 3 introduced a problem that caused the report to not total
information correctly by service.  This patch corrects this problem.  
 
5. A problem was reported with IV labels not getting cleaned up
appropriately in the MAR LABELS file (#53.41).  The MAR labels for these
discontinued or expired orders were sometimes incorrectly printing on the
wards.  This patch corrects this problem.  
 
6. A problem was reported with the Patients on Specific Drug(s) [PSJ PDV]

2. When renewing IVs, the default stop date and time is the same as the
renewed order. This patch will calculate the default stop date according
to the IV Site Parameter.
 
3. When the Update Daily Ward List (IV) [PSJI UP] option for Hyperal
orders was selected, the order view did not display on the screen.  This
patch will display the order view before prompting for the number labels
needed.
 
4. When a pick list update was ran and an order had been discontinued, the
dosage ordered was not printing on the discontinued order. This patch
corrects this problem.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. If the order's START DATE/TIME was the same as the ADMIN TIME, an
extra dose was calculated when the user entered the number of doses in the
STOP DATE/TIME field. After installation of this patch the dosage will
calculate correctly for this situation.
 
2. If an order was placed on hold and then taken off of hold the Inpatient
profile printed by the pharmacist showed the order as active while the
same profile printed by the nurse showed the order as marked to be placed
on hold. This patch corrects this problem.
 
3. Orders were being rejected with a message Invalid patient class. This
patch corrects this problem.
 
4. An undefined variable P(17) was sometimes occurring when returning from
hidden menu options when finishing an order. This patch corrects this
problem.
 
5. When using the Individual Labels (IV) [PSJI LBLI] option, the first
patient's Allergies/Reactions and Narratives were displayed for all
patients selected while still in this option. This patch will correct this
problem.
 
6. The variable PSIVSITE was undefined when IV orders were edited by the
nursing staff in the Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW] option.
Showing IV orders in this option is new functionality added to Inpatient
Medications V. 5.0. Actions taken on IV orders have always been controlled
by the Menu option and not from any pharmacy keys. After installation of
this patch users without the Pharmacist key will not be allowed to take
action on IV orders from the Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW]
option.
 
7. A problem was reported with the Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW]
option where when the user selected pending orders, Unit Dose orders, and
then Ward or Ward group patients with only pending IV orders were being
included in the list of patients. This patch will correct this problem.

1.  The original IV Solution's volume has an upper limit of 4000ml.
    This patch will increase the volume to 9999ml to meet the needs of the
    sites to enter solutions with a volume greater than 40.
    TO TEST:  Edit the Solution's volume to 9999.
 
2.  This patch will add the IV Solution's PRINT NAME {2} field (#.02),
    from the IV SOLUTIONS file (#52.7), to the MAR label, 24 Hour and 7/14
    Day MARs.
    TO TEST: Enter a new IV order with a solution that has the PRINT
              NAME {2} field (#.02) defined in the IV SOLUTIONS file
              (#52.7) and print the MAR label, and the MAR.
 
3.  When entering a new IV order the user edits the Stop date, the
    default Stop date for the next IV order will be blank.  This patch
    will make sure the default Stop date is displayed correctly.
    TO TEST: Enter a nw IV order, change the Stop date to a different
             value than the default date, accept the order.  Enter another
             new IV order, the Stop date should have a default value
             instead of being blank.
 
4.  When entering a new IV order using a Quick Code with a usual IV
    solution defined, the user is then prompted for additional additives.
    When trying to enter additional additives the user may  choose
    from solutions.
    TO TEST:  Enter a new IV order using a Quick Code with a usual IV
              solution defined, then try entering additional additives
              at the ADDITIVE: prompt or ?? the listing will display

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
E3R 11894 brought up the problem of orders containing drugs with a 2 in
the DEA SPECIAL HANDLING field (#3) in the DRUG file (#50) printing on the
AUTHORIZED ABSENCE/DISCHARGE ORDERS report instead of the following
warning:
 
*********************************************************
*  THIS IS A SCHEDULE II DRUG.  A PRESCRIPTION BLANK    * 
*  (VA FORM 10-2277d) MUST BE USED TO ORDER THIS DRUG.  *
*********************************************************
 
In Inpatient Medications Version 4.5 there was a field in the PRIMARY DRUG
file (#50.3), DEA SPECIAL HANDLING (#.02), which Inpatient Medications
used to check.  If the field contained a 2 the AUTHORIZED
ABSENCE/DISCHARGE ORDERS report would contain the warning.
 
In version 5.0 there is no DEA SPECIAL HANDLING field in the ORDERABLE
ITEM file (#50.7). After installation of this patch the Dispense Drugs in
the order will be checked and if any of those contain a 2 in the DEA
SPECIAL HANDLING field (#3) in the DRUG file (#50) then the warning will
print.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
1. An inconsistency was noted when entering orders for patients where no
orders were found for the profile selected.  When using the option Order
Entry [PSJU NE] the user was returned to the Select PATIENT: prompt. When
using the option Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] the user was prompted
Select DRUG:.  After installation of this patch both options will prompt
Select DRUG:.
 
2. A problem was reported in the generation of labels during the entry of
a unit dose order set.  If the pharmacist entering the orders had the
automatic verification user parameter set to "Yes", the labels weren't
printing correctly for the orders.  This patch will correct this problem. 
 
3. A problem was reported with the Patients on Specific Drug(s) [PSJ PDV]
option.  If the user searched on an entry in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM
file (#50.7), the report could erroneously print orders for the DRUG file
(#50) entry with the same internal entry number.  This patch will correct
this problem.
 
4. A problem was reported where a user accessed the option Order Entry    
[PSJU NE], then the user accessed the option Label Print/Reprint [PSJU
LABEL] either from the hidden menu or the regular menu and was unable to
select orders greater than 13.  The help text for this option displayed
when the user entered '??' was not appropriate either.  This patch will
correct this problem.
 
5. An error could possibly occur in routine PSGAL5 when running the
Duplicate Patient Merge software.  This patch will correct this problem.
 
6. An undefined variable DA error was reported when discontinuing an order
within a unit dose order set.  If the pharmacist has Auto Verify turned
on, an undefined error can occur when an order set is entered and one of
the orders is discontinued before finishing the order set.  This patch
will correct this error.

1. A subscript error was occurring at WS+4^PSGPL1 for some Ward Stock
items that had a "D" x-ref and no "B" x-ref.  This patch will correct this
problem.
 
2. A problem was reported where a site was finishing orders.  The first
order they finished was an IV order; the next order to be finished was a
Unit Dose order.  The user selected edit and entered "??" and received a
list of IV fields for selection.  This patch will correct this problem.
 
3. A problem was reported where orders entered thru Computerized Patient
Record Systems (CPRS) with a schedule of PO QD or QD NOON and then
finished in Inpatient Medications were printing on the Medication
Administration Record (MAR) with every other day starred out. This patch
will correct this problem.
 
4. An erroneous "Pre-Exchange DOSES:" prompt could occur when entering a
Unit Dose Order Set.  If one of the orders is discontinued while entering
the order set, the user may be prompted for Pre-Exchange DOSES
incorrectly.  This patch will correct this problem.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. A problem was reported with the default start date/time on IV orders.
An IV order was placed on 2/9 @ 10:00am with a schedule of QD.  The
schedule had an admin time of 09.  The order was finished on 2/10 before
09:00am and the default start date/time showed 2/11 @ 09:00am.  The ward
parameter was set to use next admin time. This patch will correct this
problem.
 
2. When creating a new Unit Dose order in Inpatient Medications, it was
sometimes possible to lose edits on the Start Date and Stop Date fields.
If these fields were edited before accepting the order, the changes were
sometimes lost.  This patch will correct this problem.
 
3. This patch will run a post install routine, PSJ0026, to clean up
erroneous "AC" cross-reference nodes in the PICK LIST file (#53.5).  The
post install routine identifies "AC" cross-reference nodes that do not
have a corresponding zero node entry.  These erroneous cross-reference
nodes will be deleted.
 
4. A problem was reported where a one-time order was incorrectly entered
by a ward clerk via pharmacy options.  The order was then verified by
nursing through pharmacy options, when the pharmacist viewed the expired
order he/she was not able to dc this order.  The order was non-verified by
the pharmacist and remained on the active profile.  This patch will
correct this problem.  The pharmacist will be allowed to dc or verify
non-verified expired orders just as he/she could in version 4.5.
 
5. A problem was reported with the labels printed through Computerized
Patient Record Systems (CPRS).  The labels did not reflect the status of
the order.  After installation of this patch the label node of each order
will be updated if the parameters are set to auto-print labels through
CPRS the same way this functionality works for Inpatient Medications.
 
6. On Unit Dose order entry, the duplicate drug order check is not
alerting nursing or ward clerks of duplicate drugs. This patch will
correct that problem.
 
7. A problem was found in the Stop Date calculation when finishing pending
orders from Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).  If an Orderable
Item had a default schedule type of Fill on Request and a One Time
schedule was entered for the order, the stop date was not being calculated
correctly.  This patch will correct this problem.
 
8. A problem would sometimes occur on the DA DETAILED ALLERGY/ADR LIST
ListMan screen.  The ListMan screen header would sometimes print "Page 1
of 0".  This patch will correct this problem.

1. This patch will update the activity log for orders that are
discontinued by Computerized Patient Record Systems (CPRS) due to a change
in Treating Specialty.  It adds a new entry to the ACTIVITY LOG REASON
file (#53.3).  The new entry is 1040 AUTO DISCONTINUED (TREATING SPECIALTY
TRANSFER).

2.  When queuing an Extra Units Dispensed Report to a printer the last
line was not being printed.  This patch will correct this problem.
 
3. The Cost at Discharge [PSJU DCR] option was mistakenly left out of the
Inpatient Medications version 5.0 distribution.  This option is no longer
used. This patch will distribute the option as Delete at Site.
 
4. A problem was identified with the auto-reinstate feature.  A patient
had an active order that was auto-discontinued upon ward transfer.  He was
then issued a new order for the same drug. The transfer was later deleted
and his previous meds were reinstated.  As a result, the patient ended up
with 2 duplicate orders.
 
Checks have now been included to prevent the reinstatement of an order if
a new duplicate order has been added.  For IVs, if the order to be
reinstated has any additive the same as the new order it will not be
reinstated.
 
The notification e-mail, advising of medication orders automatically
reinstated, has also been amended to include any orders that could not be
re-instated due to duplicates existing on the system. The recipient list
for the e-mail also now includes the verifying nurse, verifying
pharmacist, the physician, the provider and who entered the record (where
applicable).
 
5.  When using the "edit intervention" after a critical interaction comes
up on UD order entry, the prompt "Intervention" came up with the default
of ALLERGY instead of CRITICAL INTERACTION.  This has now been amended so
that if a Critical or a Significant drug interaction is detected, the
appropriate default is used.

When a nurse verifies a pending Inpatient Medications order through CPRS

3. After admitting a patient, if an Inpatient Medications order was placed
in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and the admission was
subsequently cancelled, it was still possible to Finish the order in

6. If the Default Start Date Calculation is set to "Use Closest Admin Time
As Default" and the order was edited through CPRS, the original Start
Date/time was used as a default for the order when finished in the
pharmacy. This was a Unit Dose order and it did not have an administration
time. This patch will correct this problem.  NOIS: CON-0499-11371
 
7. This patch will remove two erroneous identifier nodes from the data
dictionary of the WARD GROUP file (#57.5).  After the installation of
PSJ*5.0*10 these erroneous nodes will display the incorrect printer as an
identifier when doing a look up on the WARD GROUP file (#57.5).  This
patch will correct this problem. This patch will also install a new ID
node for the BAXTER ATC DEVICE POINTER field (#32). NOIS BRK-0599-11977
 
8. When renewing a Unit Dose order that had already expired, the software
would calculate, in version 4.5, the pre-exchange quantity to send.  This
was facilitated by the presentation of the "Pre-Exchange DOSES:" prompt.
In version 5.0 this prompt was being bypassed, continuing on to the next
order prompt.  This patch will correct this problem.  NOIS MAR-0599-21852.
 
9. When a pharmacist was verifying a renewed drug order and first called
up an activity log, the dispense drug was being eliminated from the order.
The pharmacist could not then verify the order because a field was blank.
This occurred only when an activity log was called up. When the pharmacist
entered an up-arrow to get out, the order was verified at that point. This
patch will correct this problem. NOIS NTH-0699-70263.
 
10. When entering a Unit Dose order set and editing fields, it was
possible for some edits to not be reflected in the verified order.  This

1. This patch introduces changes to the patient and single order locking
between Inpatient Medications V. 5.0, Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0, and
Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0.
 
The software will be modified to lock Pharmacy application users at the
patient level when a medication order is selected through the Inpatient
Medication V. 5.0 Unit Dose or IV menu options.  This will prevent
multiple Pharmacy application users from processing medication orders for
the same patient at the same time.
 
The software will be modified to lock all external applications at the
order level when an order is selected through Inpatient Medications for
any action (Renew, Discontinue, Edit, Finish, Verify, Hold, Unhold, On
Call, Mark Not to be Given, Mark Incomplete, New Order Entry, Copy, Speed
Finish, Speed Renew, Speed Verify or Speed Discontinue).
 
The software will be modified to provide identification of any external
application users who are entering orders into the same patient record
accessed by an Inpatient Medications application user processing orders
through Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 for actions generating a new order.
 
 
2. Currently, Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 software performs order checks
when a new medication order is placed through either the Inpatient
Medications or Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) applications.
The Pharmacy Benefits Management group requested that the Inpatient
Medications application provide order checking for orders renewed through
Inpatient Medications or CPRS packages. This functionality will ensure the
user is alerted to possible adverse reactions and will reduce the
possibility of a medication error due to the omission of an order check
when a non-active medication order is renewed. This patch will add this
functionality.

3. Unit Dose orders were entered through Computerized Patient Record

then these Unit Dose orders were signed and released to the Inpatient

Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW] option when an order summary was
done under the ward group ^OTHER.  The site could take no action on these

these orders from being accepted by the Inpatient Medications package and
prevent this problem from taking place.  NOIS MON-0699-52149.
 
4. Medication orders were Dc'd on transfer, the transfer was deleted.
The orders were reinstated with the MailMan message going to the group
and the pharmacist.  Some duplicate orders were not reinstated.  The
pharmacist tried to reinstate using the RN function in the long profile.
The user got the message that the order was reinstated, but it wasn't.
This patch corrects this problem. NOIS CON-0799-10709.
 
5. A problem was reported with some reports when they were queued to the
spooler.  The following IV reports: 
 
ACtive Order Report by Ward/Drug (IV) [PSJI AOR]

were not being processed to completion, resulting in the files never
becoming available to print. This patch corrects this problem.  NOIS
BRX-0398-12645, POR-0699-52667 and OKL-0899-70364.
 
6.  When printing the 7 Day MAR [PSJU 7D MAR] and the 14 Day MAR [PSJU 14D
MAR] reports, the text for the Other Print Info was sometimes appearing in
the Notes column.  There was also a problem whereby the text of the Other
Print Info was not wrapping correctly if the text length was greater than
47 characters.  Also, if the order did not have a solution defined the
lines were not wrapping correctly.  This patch corrects these problems.
NOIS IOW-0599-41089, MWV-0799-20528 and PUG-0899-52623.
 
7.  A problem was reported where a user accessed the option Extra Units
Dispensed [PSJU EUD] or Report Returns [PSJU RET] from the hidden menu
and was unable to select orders greater then 13.  The Help text for this
option displayed when the user entered '??' was not appropriate either.
This patch will correct this problem. NOIS NHM-0699-10837.
 
8. A problem was reported by a site where when running the option Extra
Units Dispensed [PSJU EUD] they were getting a message THIS DRUG IS AN ATC
ITEM. BUT THE ATC DEVICE CANNOT BE FOUND! This was happening on a ward
they had recently set up. This patch will correct this problem. NOIS
CLE-0899-40919.
 
9. A problem was identified whereby the option Patient Profile (Extended)
[PSJ EXTP] was not displaying the full activity logs for orders.  This

if the patient received an outpatient IV order it would print the order
with the ward location and room-bed of their last admission.  This patch
corrects this problem.  NOIS MIW-0899-41313
 
2. A problem was reported with the pharmacist finishing an order entered
through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Inpatient Medications
dialogue.  The pharmacist elected to finish the order as an IV and entered
a quick code at the additive prompt. The additive name was set, but none
of the other information from the quick code was entered into the order.
This patch corrects this problem.  NOIS SDC-0699-61236
 
3.  A problem was reported when editing orders that are entered via unit
dose order sets.  During the order set entry, edits made after the order

1. When entering unit dose orders through the pharmacy back door with an
order set, 2 sets of labels were printed after the order is verified.
This was incorrect, only one set of labels should be produced.  This patch
corrects that problem.  NOIS MIW-0999-41081.
 
2. Providers were unable to discontinue orders placed on-call through
pharmacy back door options using Computerized Patient Record System
(CPRS) options.  This patch corrects this problem.  E3R 12975 and 12832.
 
3. When printing a Medications Due Worksheet through the Medications Due
Worksheet [PSJ MDWS] option, the user was receiving a divide by zero
error.  This patch will correct this problem. NOIS NJH-0999-20805.
 
4. An inconsistency was identified with the way in which Inpatient
Medications was handling orders placed on hold through pharmacy options.
Outpatient Pharmacy does not allow orders placed on hold through pharmacy
options to be released from hold using Computerized Patient Record System
(CPRS) options.  With the installation of this patch the same will be true
for Inpatient Medications.
 
5. The possibility exists for orders placed on hold to not have their
status updated to expired and still show on the Inpatient Medications
profile and on the Active Orders tab through Computerized Patient Record
System (CPRS) after the patient has been discharged from the hospital.
This patch will correct this problem.  NOIS HUN-0999-22147.
 
6. When entering a new Unit Dose order that contained a drug that is
marked for Unit Dose and Outpatient, an error was occurring when checking
the medical center's formulary.  The drug was being checked to determine
if the dispense drug was valid for the order but was using an invalid date
comparison.  This patch will correct this problem.  NOIS PUG-0999-51369.
 
7. A site was assigning long room-bed names to their beds, the names were
reaching 11 characters, the room-bed names were running into the patient
names when the site printed their pick list using the Pick List [PSJU PL]
option.  This patch corrects this problem.  NOIS WNY-1099-10002.
 
8. When finishing an IV order for the first time, the default for the
additive was display and the Stop date was calculated from the NUMBER OF
DAYS FOR IV ORDER field (#3) in the IV ADDITIVES file (#52.6).  If the
user did not accept the order and exited all the way to the patient prompt
and selected the same order to finish again, the default additive will not
display and the Stop date was calculated from the IV ROOM file (#59.5).
This patch corrects this problem.   NOIS: HUN-1099-20146.  
 
9. When finishing a Unit Dose order as an IV, the additive linked to the
corresponding IV Orderable did not display as a defaulted.  This patch

2. A problem was reported with the display of a pending order when using
the option Patient Profile (Extended) [PSJ EXTP].  The order would display
with the patient's name and the status of Not Verified, the rest of the
order information would display as NOT FOUND or *s.  This patch corrects
this problem.  NOIS ISH-1099-41686.
 
3. Currently, if a unit dose order has multiple dispense drugs, the order
check is performed for the first dispense drug only.  With this patch, any
additional dispense drugs entered for the order will be checked for
allergies and drug-drug interactions.  This will apply to new orders
entered using the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] or Order Entry [PSJU NE]
options and when finishing pending unit dose orders or renewing unit dose
orders.
 
4.  A problem was reported with trying to enter a new intervention from
the Pharmacy Intervention Menu [PSO INTERVENTION MENU] through List
Manager.  The user selected the Enter Pharmacy Intervention [PSO
INTERVENTION NEW ENTRY] option, tried to enter a new intervention,
received two question marks and was unable to do so. On the protocol [PSJ

exceptions.  This patch provides the patient merge software with an API to
call before the package begins it data validation of the FROM and TO
records of the duplicate patients to clear up some of these data
exceptions in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) specifically the Unit Dose

1. A problem was reported where a site admitted a patient and the patient
didn't show up and was discharged.  The patient later showed up and was
admitted to the hospital.  When Medical Administration Service (MAS) later
reviewed the record and deleted the first admission Inpatient Medication
orders placed for the second admission were auto dc'd.  This patch will
correct this problem. NOIS SLC-1199-51222.
 
2. With this patch, the IV TYPE will be prompted when finishing an IV
fluid order.   "ADMIXTURE" will be the default IV TYPE.  E3R #11576.
 
3. The "*" sometime displayed next to the Start and Stop dates even
though no new order is created.  This patch will correct this problem.
 
4. For IV orders entered with schedules like QOD, Q48H and Q72H, labels
were being printing daily when scheduled labels were run.  The frequency
of the printing of the labels should reflect the schedule entered.  This
patch corrects this problem.  NOIS REN-1199-61217.
 
5. A problem was reported where a pharmacist edited the rate on an IV
order and when the changed order was viewed in Computerized Patient Record
System (CPRS) the rate would show without the ml/hr.  CPRS will issue a
patch to begin picking up the ml/hr from the messages sent by
pharmacy.  This patch makes changes to the rate validation entry point
ORINF^PSIVSP Inpatient Medications provides to CPRS to help resolve this
issue and to allow the infusion rate with the ml/hr to pass the validation
checks in this entry point for orders that may be renewed or changed
through CPRS.  NOIS WIC-0199-40011.

1.  A site without 24-hour pharmacy coverage entered an E3R requesting
that Inpatient Medications allow users holding the PSJ RNURSE key be
allowed to finish and verify orders placed through Computerized Patient
Record System (CPRS).  This would put the orders in an active status, so
they would be available to the Bar Code Med Admin (BCMA) software.  The
E3R# is 11620. With the installation of this patch, users who hold the PSJ
RNFINSH key will have the option to finish and verify orders placed
through CPRS. It was decided by the workgroup that a new key should be
created to control this additional functionality.  E3R# 11620, and NOIS
TUA-0999-32647.
 
2.  In the Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW] option, the order was
not locked correctly if the user chose "NO Profile" at the "SHORT, LONG,
or NO Profile?  SHORT//" prompt.  This patch will correct this problem.
 
3.  Within the LBL Label Print/Reprint hidden action, if the user selected
the ILIV Individual Labels (IV) option, a new order may be entered.  This
patch will prevent any new orders from being entered from the hidden menu.
 
4.  When a pending order had a schedule of "ONE TIME", "ONE-TIME", "ONCE"
or "STAT", the Schedule Type is not defaulted to "ONE TIME".  This patch
will set the Schedule Type to "ONE TIME" for these types of schedule. NOIS

Admin Time.  The start date/time was incorrectly displayed as ******** and
the stop date/time was incorrectly displayed as 59/00/23  0:00.  This
patch will correct this problem.  NOIS CON-0100-10187.
 
2. Additional functionality is included in this patch to change the PSJHL
routines to do an additional check to ensure that the patient IEN received
from Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) matches the IEN stored in
the pending order before allowing actions on pending orders.
 
3. A problem was reported where a site was trying to renew an IV order
through CPRS and was receiving the message Invalid Infusion Rate. The
problem was that when finishing the order Pharmacy changed the infusion
rate to the format Text@# and this was not being passed back to CPRS when
the new order was created.  This patch corrects this problem. 
NOIS HIN-0100-41126.
 
4. E3R# 11771, Change Nature of Order auto prompt requested that the
default for orders changed in pharmacy due to edit should be Service
Correction rather than Written.  This patch changes this functionality.
 
5. A problem was reported by a site when using the option Inpatient Order
Entry [PSJ OE] to enter new orders.  At the 'SCHEDULE: ' prompt the user
would enter a question mark and answer 'yes' to the prompt 'Do you want
the entire ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE List?'. Part of the resulting list
would scroll off the top part of the screen; the user was using a CRT and
couldn't scroll back to see the data.  This patch will correct this
problem.  NOIS MUR-0100-31928.
 
6. A problem was reported by a site on a Unit Dose order which was
originally placed through Inpatient Medication options.  The order had
dispense drugs entered when it was ordered and these were not passed to
CPRS.  When the order was copied through the CPRS option, no default
dispense drug was displayed to the user and no order checks took place.
CPRS does not allow more than one dispense drug per Unit Dose order.  This
patch will correct this problem for orders where there is one dispense
drug for the order, but not more than one.  NOIS MAC-0200-62454.

running the option EXtra Units Dispensed [PSJU EUD] if the drug is set up
to be dispensed through the ATC. This patch will change the default for
this prompt to No.
 
2. A site had questions about the documentation for the option
AUto-Discontinue Set-Up [PSJ AC SET-UP].  In the on-line documentation,
ICU was used as a service.  This is not one of the services defined in the
WARD LOCATION file (#42).  ICU has been replaced with Surgery. NOIS
PHO-0100-62836.
 
3.  A problem was reported where pending IV orders were being discontinued
through the Inpatient Medications options and no Nature of Order was being
passed to Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).  This patch corrects
this problem.  NOIS PTH-0300-21183.
 
4.  A problem was reported that when using the Unit Dose/Pick List option
EXtra Units Dispensed [PSJU EUD], when saying YES to have the drug
dispensed through the ATC machine, it was not packaged.  The problem is
caused by the Extra Units Dispensed using a field that is set to be
deleted for the ATC device.  This patch corrects the problem.  NOIS
UNY-0400-12501.
 
5.  If a schedule "ONE-TIME" is not defined in the Administration Schedule
file (#51.1), it does not recognize in the IV piggyback order and the
Start and Stop date/times are not set appropriately.  With this patch
One-Time will be given the Start and Stop date/time as in the unit dose
functionality. NOIS SDC-0300-60125.
 
6.  The nurse's initials for verifying IV orders in CPRS are not passing
to the Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) package to display on the
VDL.  This patch will correct this problem.
 
7.  This patch adds the FREQUENCY field (#41) to the 11th piece in
^TMP("PSJ",$J,4).  This becomes a part of the information returned by the
API provided in the PSJBCMA1 routine to the Bar Code Medication
Administration (BCMA) package.
 
8.  A problem was reported where a site was unable to enter an infusion
rate in the format FREE TEXT@NUMBER OF LABELS PER DAY through CPRS. This
patch corrects this problem by updating the entry point ORINF^PSIVSP.
NOIS DEN-0400-52116.
 
9.  A problem was reported where a site had IV Fluid orders entered via
Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).  The orders were finished
through the backdoor pharmacy options as piggyback orders and the ward
specific administration times were not presented as the default for the
pharmacy user finishing the orders. This patch corrects this problem.
NOIS CLL-0500-41826.
 
10. This patch also modifieds the API routines PSJBCMA1 and PSJBCMA2 to
use ^TMP("PSJ1" and ^TMP("PSJ2", respectively, to make a distinction
between the two different sets of data returned to the Bar Code Medication
Administration (BCMA) package.

1.  Several sites have reported a problem related to medication orders
getting mixed up.   The problem most frequently reported is that a Unit
Dose order is being changed to an IV order.  The development team has been
unable to recreate this problem, but thinks the problem may be a result of
using the variable DFN in the PSJHL messaging routines.  With the
installation of this patch the variable DFN will be changed to PSJHLDFN in
the PSJHL messaging routines. Additionally checks have been added to PSJOE
and PSJLIFN to be sure that the order number being finished is the order
number being updated and that the DFN of the patient selected matches the
DFN of the patient in the pending order being updated. This should keep
the problem from occurring.

3.  A site reported a problem with an inconsistency in calculating the
stop date of a renewal order.  When finishing a renewal from the
Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) the least of all the stop dates
was used.  However, in backdoor pharmacy, the stop date for the orderable
item was always used, if it existed.  This patch corrects this problem by
modifying the backdoor pharmacy function to behave the same as the
finishing process.  NOIS:  EKH-0600-41622
 
4.  Two sites reported a problem with an inconsistency with the handling
of the stop date for One-Time orders.  When finishing a One-Time order
entered in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), if the stop date
was edited, the start date was also changed.  However, in backdoor
pharmacy, this was not the case.  This patch corrects this problem by
modifying the finishing process to work the same as backdoor pharmacy.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. Several sites have reported a problem with the ACTIVITY LOG REASON file
(#53.3).  The sites have entry numbers 1 - 75, a "B" x-ref, and are
missing entry numbers 1035 and 1040.  This patch will delete the current
Data Dictionary (DD) and data for this file at the site and bring in the
correct DD and data.  The pre-init routine PSJ0043 accomplishes the
deletion of the DD and the data and will be automatically deleted once
the installation is complete. NOIS# HAM-0300-21499.
 
2. Several sites have reported a problem when trying to document the
dispensing of medications through the Bar Code Med Admin (BCMA)
software.  The sites have reported receiving the following error:
 
  1. Data Validation Error: 701: The value 'AC' for field DOSES ORDERED in
  DISPENSE DRUG SUB-FIELD in file BCMA MEDICATION LOG is not valid.
 
The problem was with the input transform on the UNITS PER DOSE field
(#.02) in the DISPENSE DRUG sub-file (#53.4502) of the INPATIENT USER
PARAMETERS file (#53.45) and the DISPENSE DRUG sub-file (#53.11) of the
NON-VERIFIED ORDERS file (#53.1). The problem with the input transform
also exists in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55), UNIT DOSE sub-file
(#55.06), DISPENSE DRUG sub-file (#55.07), UNITS PER DOSE field (#.02).
Patch PSS*1*35 corrects this problem in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55)
and this patch corrects the problem in the INPATIENT USER PARAMETERS file
(#53.45) and the NON-VERIFIED ORDERS file (#53.1).  NOIS#s NOL-0300-71473,
HOU-0300-71626, and CMO-0300-43187.
 
3. Site reported a problem where they entered an infusion rate of @x and
x labels didn't print.  Only 1 label printed.  The issue is that only one
administration time was specified.  The administration time overrides
the entry of @x when determining how many labels will print.  This patch
modifies the field description and documentation for INFUSION RATE in
order to clarify which field determines the number of labels.  Modified
the INFUSION RATE field (#59) in the NON-VERIFIED ORDERS file (#53.1).
 
4. This patch modifies the following fields to remove references to the
company name of Baxter:  PICK LIST file (#53.5), DATA/TIME LIST SENT TO
THE ATC field (#.13), UNIT DOSE/ATC MEDS file (#53.55), PICK LIST field
(#.01), UNIT DOSE/ATC MEDS file (#53.55), LAST RECORD SENT field (#1),
UNIT DOSE/ATC MEDS file (#53.55), DATA RECORDS field (#10), UNIT DOSE/ATC
MEDS file (#53.55), DATA RECORDS sub-file (#10), DATA RECORDS field
(#.01), WARD GROUP file (#57.5), BAXTER ATC DEVICE POINTER field (#32) and
the description of the UNIT DOSE/ATC MEDS file (#53.55).
 
5. This patch removes the references to the specific model 212 ATC
dispensing system from the description of the UNIT DOSE/ATC MEDS file
(#53.55).
 
6. This patch modifies the following menu options to remove references to
the company name of Baxter:  Send Pick List to ATC [PSJU PLATCS] and
Dispense Drug/ATC Set Up [PSSJU DRUG/ATC SET UP].

1. A problem was reported by a site where one time Unit Dose orders
entered through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) after hours,
finished by a nurse with the PSJ RNFINISH key, and verified by the nurse
on the ward, were not appearing on the summary of non-verified orders for
the Pharmacist using the Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW] option.
This patch corrects this problem.  NOIS# CLL-0500-41728.
 
2. An E3R was entered requesting that nurses using the
Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW] option see expired non-verified
Unit Dose orders when selecting NO PROFILE.  E3R# 11834.
 
3. A problem was reported by a site that when finishing a Unit Dose
pending renewal a change was made that caused a new order to be created.
The original order retained the renewed status and the stop date/time was
not updated so that it would expire when the new order's start date/time
was reached.  This patch corrects this problem.  NOIS# HIN-0300-41916.
 
4. An inconsistency was discovered between the Computerized Patient Record
System (CPRS) and the Inpatient Medications validation of Provider
Comments/Special Instructions.  CPRS allows entry of text with no spaces
while Inpatient Medications requires spaces.  This patch corrects this
problem.  Inpatient Medications will now allow entry of Special
Instructions with no spaces.  NOIS# ASH-0500-30650.
 
5. A problem was reported with label print if the Provider Comments
entered in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) contained no spaces.
This patch modifies label print to correctly print the information even if
no spaces are present.  NOIS# NAS-0400-32349.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1.  Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) has requested that Technical
Services develop a software patch that would disable the Drug file (#50)
Internal Entry Number (IEN) (.001 field) lookup during order entry
processes.  The pharmacy software has always allowed IEN lookup and quick
code lookups at the request of field users.  A quick code is a
user-defined synonym for a drug (i.e. A325-&gt;Acetaminophen 325mg Tab).  PBM
provided guidance to VA Medical Centers in the past to not use low numbers
for quick codes and to inactivate the first 50 entries in the drug file to
reduce the chances of error.  This patch would eliminate drug selection in
the ordering processes by entry of the Internal Entry Number.
 
2.  Order check warning does not display in back door order entry for
users with the  "ALLOW AUTO-VERIFY FOR USER" set to yes.  This patch will
correct this problem.  NOIS# POR-0900-50194.

1. Several sites have reported a problem with the start date/time on Unit
Dose orders placed through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)
defaulting in as "********" and the stop date/time defaulting in as
"00/00/24  :".  If the pharmacist finishing the order doesn't catch this
discrepancy in the start and stop date/time, the order can be finished
without a start and stop date/time.  Then the order is visible in CPRS on
the orders tab, but not on the meds tab, and not in Inpatient Medications.
This patch corrects this problem.  NOIS# DAN-1200-41606, UNY-1200-11451,
BEC-1200-20932.
 
2. When selecting from the Orderable Item file(#50.7), the SYNONYM lookup
was allowed and patch PSJ*5.0*52 removed this capability.  This patch will
restore the ability of entering a SYNONYM at the "Select Drug:" prompt.
NOIS# REN-1100-62137.
 
3. When selecting from the Drug file (#50), the user entered lowercase

1. E3R# 14641 requested that the UD Default Stop Date/Time be reset to
null when Inpatient Medication orders are discontinued due to a Treating
Specialty Change.  This patch will accomplish this request.
 
2. A problem was reported where a nurse entered an order through the
Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) options using verbal or
telephoned as the nature of order.  When the order was finished and a
detailed view of the order was done on the meds tab in CPRS the nurse was
showing as the Pharmacist.  This patch corrects this problem. 
NOIS# NAS-0700-30575 and DEN-0700-50863.
 
3. A problem was reported by a site where they were doing a detailed
display of a unit dose medication order on the meds tab through CPRS and
the field Units/Dose was displayed as null and through Inpatient
Medications the UNITS PER DOSE field (#.02) of the Dispense Drug sub-file
was displayed as 1. In Inpatient Medications if the UNITS PER DOSE field
is null it is assumed that 1 unit is to be dispensed and a 1 is displayed.
This patch makes changes to the API that CPRS calls to make the
information display consistently.  NOIS# PUG-1000-51002.
         *****PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING INFO*****
 If a unit dose order contains more than one dispense drug only dosage
ordered will be returned to CPRS and no units per dose. If a unit dose
order has a status of pending and the units per dose field is null, no
units per dose will be returned.
 
4. A problem was reported by a site where a medications order placed on
hold through Inpatient Medications options and then taken off hold through
these same options was not displaying correctly on the orders tab in CPRS.
The order text was not being updated appropriately.  The status showed as
active, but the word hold still showed on the left side of the order text.
This patch corrects this problem.  NOIS# ROS-0900-52226.

1. A site reported a problem in the PAtient Profile (Unit Dose) [PSJU PR]
option.  When entering '^^' at the 'View ORDERS' prompt, an error was
received.  This patch corrects this problem.
 
2. A site reported a problem with the number of labels printing after an
infusion rate of xxx@0 was entered.  Even though they entered 0 for the
number of labels, labels still printed.  This patch corrects this problem.
 
3. A site reported a problem with receiving an error in Bar Code
Medication Administration (BCMA) when attempting to access the pharmacy
patient activity log.  This patch modifies the API to BCMA by adding the
internal entry number of the person who performs an action on a unit dose
order to the information passed back to BCMA.  In addition, the API has
been changed to send all activities for the IV orders, even if no data was
edited.
 
4. A site reported a problem with MAR labels not printing when a nurse
verified the order in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).  This
patch corrects this problem.
 
5. A site reported a problem with the Inpatient Profile [PSJ PR] option
when attempting to print certain patients.  If a patient had an order with
more than six activity log entries, the option would go into an infinite
loop when printing to a printer.  This patch corrects this problem.
 
6. A problem was discovered with the handling of date/time validations in
Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE].  There was a problem with the way the
option was verifying that a time had been entered.  This patch corrects

2. A site reported a problem where the user received an undefined error
when a Pharmacy Technician or Nurse was using the Non-Verified/Pending
Orders [PSJU VBW] option and viewing pending IV orders.  The user was
prompted "Select IV ROOM NAME:", the user entered a return or an up-arrow
and received the undefined error.  With the installation of this patch the
Pharmacy Technician or Nurse will be prompted after selecting the
Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW] option for the IV ROOM NAME, if the
user returns past the prompt or enters an up-arrow the user will be
returned to the main menu.  Users will only be prompted if there is more
than one active IV ROOM in the IV ROOM file (#59.5).  This patch corrects
this problem. NOIS# BRX-0301-10962.
 
3. After the release of patch PSJ*5*51, several sites reported a problem
that occurred while using the OR GUA EVENT PROCESSOR protocol on the DGPM
MOVEMENT EVENTS protocol an error would occur.  Sites were advised to
switch to the OR GUA EVENT PROCESSOR NOTASK, this corrected the error, but
sites began reporting problems with the release of time delayed orders.

1. Several sites reported errors when attempting to evaluate clinical
reminders.  The problem was caused by dates in the PHARMACY PATIENT file
(#55) that were in the wrong format.  This patch corrects the format of
those dates. NOIS# BUT-0401-21836, MON-0401-52179, EKH-0401-42360,
SDC-0401-62568.
 
If after installing and running PSJ*5*61 your site is still receiving the
&lt;UNDEFINED&gt;LDATE+8~PXRMDRUG error, it may be necessary to call the
following entry point within the Clinical Reminders software
KILLPC^PXRMPINF(PXRMDFN) where PXRMDFN = "PXRMDFN"_DFN.  You can identify
the patients DFN from the error.
 
$ZE= LDATE+8^PXRMDRUG:1, %DSM-E-UNDEF, undefined variable
^XTMP("PXRMDFN6762","PSDRUG","INSULIN NOVOLIN N-HUMAN NPH
100U/ML",3001214.10445), -DSM-I-ECODE, MUMPS error code: M7 
 
For example, in this case you would type D KILLPC^PXRMPINF("PXRMDFN6762").
 
While the patch corrects the errors in the dates, the ^XTMP global built
by the Clinical Reminders software only gets rebuilt if it is more than 24
hours old and may not have been rebuilt before the software evaluates the
next clinical reminder.  The above entry point will force the rebuilding
of the ^XTMP for the patient that generated the error.

1.  There have been several requests that the information in the SPECIAL
INSTRUCTIONS field (#8) and the OTHER PRINT INFO field (#31) from the
PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) be passed to Computerized Patient Record
System (CPRS) to be displayed on the Orders Tab.  With the installation of
this patch Inpatient Medications will begin passing this information to
CPRS. NOIS# BHH-0700-42241.
 
2.  A problem was reported by a site where the UD PROVIDER field (#62.02)
of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) was not being updated or the provider
in that field was being presented as the default provider in backdoor
pharmacy order entry even though the provider was no longer active.
This patch corrects this problem.  NOIS# BRX-0700-10937.
 
3.  A problem was reported where a cross-reference was left around which
should have been killed.  This caused it to appear as though the patient
had an order that needed processing when there was no order.  When the
order was selected the user received an undefined error.  This patch
corrects this problem.  NOIS# NJH-0800-20230.
 
4.  A problem was reported by a site where the infusion rate on an order
was not being returned to CPRS appropriately.  The problem was in the
messaging routines, which always expected there to be a space between the
numeric rate and the text of the rate.  This patch corrects this problem.
NOIS# CON-0900-11408.
 
5.  A site reported a problem when editing the orderable item in the
Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] option.  The stop date is not being set
correctly. This patch corrects this problem by recalculating the stop date
for an order if the orderable item is changed.  NOIS# BOI-1299-51410.
 
6.  A site reported a problem where editing an order caused a new order
to be generated with a new stop date, but the user had no indication that
a new stop date was calculated.  This patch corrects this problem by
changing the display of the stop date to indicate the entry was modified
(for unit dose orders only).  NOIS# NAS-0600-31201.
 
7.  There are two cases where a prompt can be modified when editing an
active order and the display will not highlight the change before asking
the user to accept the changes.  The two prompts are "Admin Times:" and
"Stop:".  This patch corrects this problem by modifying the display
routine to highlight these fields if they are modified (for unit dose
orders only).
 
8.  When editing either the stop date or the start date for a one-time
order, under most conditions, the other entry will also be changed.  This
patch corrects this problem by modifying the entry process to only edit
the field selected, not both the stop and start date.  Note:  one of the
requirements to correct this was to delete the triggers from the
NON-VERIFIED ORDERS file (#53.1), START DATE/TIME field (#10).
NOIS# BOI-1299-51410.
 
9. Several sites have reported issues with the calculation of the start
date when an order is renewed.  Specifically, dealing with displaying
orders on the Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) Virtual Due List.
This patch changes the calculation of the start date for a renewed order
to use the following logic: If BCMA has marked the drug as given against
a scheduled administration time, take the administration time and add the
frequency.  If the time is in the future, use this as the start date for
the order.  This will be true even for a non-standard schedule if the
user enters administration times.  If the drug is marked as given, but
there is no associated scheduled administration time, take the time the
drug was given, add the frequency and round up to the next hour.  If the
time is in the future, use this as the start date for the order.  If the
time calculated in either case, is in the past, if the drug was never
given or the drug was marked as held, the current calculation logic will
be used and the start date will be determined by the ward parameters.
Please note: this logic will apply to regular renew and regular finish.
Speed renew and speed finish will not be effected.  NOIS# NCH-0700-41081.
 
10. A site reported a problem with editing multiple one-time orders for a
patient.  The problem was that the edit of the stop date on the first
order was stored correctly, but not on the following orders.  This patch
corrects this problem.  NOIS# BOI-0700-51308.
 
11. A problem was reported where a pharmacist was finishing an order for a
patient and specifying that the order was a self-med.  When the pharmacist
reviewed the order afterwards the self-med designation was not showing.
The pharmacist then had to go back and edit the order again and designate
it as self-med.  This patch corrects this problem.
NOIS# LEB-0700-21514.
 
12. A problem was reported where a site was unable to renew IV Fluid
orders thru CPRS.  These orders originated from backdoor Inpatient
Medications options.  The provider would receive a message that the
infusion rate was invalid.  This patch corrects this problem.
NOIS# ANN-0900-40829.
 
13. A site reported a problem with the calculation of the start date for
an order with a schedule such as QOD.  If the order was placed after the
administration time for the day had passed, and the start date was set to
begin at the next administration time, the order was scheduled to start in
two days.  This patch corrects this problem by making the start date be
the next day at the scheduled administration time.  NOIS# MAR-1000-20645.
 
14. A site reported a problem with the MAR labels printing when a pharmacy
technician edited an order even though labels were only supposed to print
on pharmacist verification.  This patch corrects this problem.

NOIS# HUN-0900-21331.
 
2. A problem was reported by a site where they were receiving emails from
the BCMA software regarding IV orders which were not being displayed on
the Virtual Due List (VDL). The problem was with the API routines that
Inpatient Medications (IM) supplies to BCMA.  IV orders don't have a
schedule type and IM was determining a pseudo schedule type for IV orders,
if the start and stop date/times were the same it was a one time order, if
the schedule contained "PRN" it was a PRN order, otherwise it was
continuous.  Now IM will also set IV orders with a schedule of TODAY,
ONCE, NOW, ONE TIME, ONE-TIME, 1 TIME, 1TIME, 1-TIME, and STAT as one time
orders.  NOIS# WPB-0101-30986.
 
3. On the BCMA Workgroup call, it was requested that IM start returning an
additional pseudo schedule type for IV orders.  The new pseudo schedule
type will be ON CALL.  IV orders with ON CALL, ON-CALL, or ONCALL in the
schedule field will be returned to BCMA in the API with a pseudo schedule
type of 'OC'.
 
4. An obsolete reference to a variable pointer definition was found in the
MARS LABELS file (#53.41).  This patch corrects this problem by removing
the obsolete reference from the data dictionary.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. The Pharmacy Ordering Enhancements (POE) project provides enhancements
to Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0, Inpatient Medications V. 5.0,
Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0, and Order Entry/Results Reporting (OE/RR) V.
3.0 medication ordering dialogues to eliminate redundant entry of drug
information during medication order entry, provide a more consistent
medication order entry process, provide expanded order checking, display
documented drug formulary statuses and corresponding
restriction/guidelines to the provider and pharmacist at the time of order
entry, and improve the process of medication order transfer between
Inpatient Medications and Outpatient Pharmacy applications.  This project
directly supports Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), which is a
key component of Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) plan to expand
support for clinical operations. Additionally, order checks will be
provided for medication orders for which a dispense drug has not been
selected during the CPRS order entry process. It is also intended as a way
to help meet the goal outlined in Objective 8, Action 1 in the
Prescription for Change, which outlines the need to coordinate
national/Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) formularies and share
drug treatment guideline information. This project will promote system-
wide sharing of drug reviews and treatment guidelines thereby enhancing
patient safety.
 
This project consists of four patches that work together to accomplish
these goals listed in order of install:
 
     PSO*7*46
     OR*3*94
     PSS*1*38
     PSJ*5*50
 
2. A problem was reported by a site when an order was placed through the
Inpatient Medications dialogue. When pharmacy finished the order, they
were prompted to finish as either IV or Unit Dose. If the user chose to
finish this as an IV, a new order was created.  With the installation of
the POE project a new order will no longer be created. This patch corrects
this problem.  NOIS# WNY-0498-10040.
 
3. A problem was found when entering a "P" at the Start Date/Time prompt
for a Unit Dose order.  The user always received the message "No other
order found with this drug.", even if there was another order with the
same orderable item.  This patch corrects this problem.
 
4. Inpatient Medications will be adding a new parameter to the PHARMACY
SYSTEM file (#59.7). The parameter will be 'CALC UNITS NEEDED PRN ORDERS'.
The parameter will allow for the calculation of UNITS NEEDED on the Pick
List for orders with PRN in the schedule.  Currently orders with PRN in
the schedule are shown on the Pick List with a UNITS NEEDED of 0.  This
functionality was requested in E3R #12078, which had been reviewed and
approved by the Inpatient Medications E3R Workgroup and assigned a
priority of low.  With the changes in CPRS for the POE project to include
the PRN button, it was felt that this should be addressed now since the
potential exists for Inpatient Medications to receive more orders with PRN
in the schedule.
 
5.  A problem was reported by a site where they had a schedule of
APPLY@09/REMOVE@21 in their ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) and the
admin times were not defaulting into the order when it was finished.  This
patch corrects this problem.  NOIS# SPO-0101-50812.
 
6. A problem was reported by a site where they had a schedule of Q3MONTHS
in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) and the frequency was
calculated as 1440, which would be a daily schedule.  Changes were made in
Pharmacy Data Management (PDM), Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA),
and Inpatient Medications to tighten up the code, which calculates the
frequency of the orders.  This patch corrects the Inpatient Medications
portion of the problem.  PSS*1*38 addresses the same issue in PDM. NOIS#
SHE-1200-51826.
 
7. E3R# 15571 asks that the Pick List round up the units per dose to the
next whole number if it is not a whole number and use this to calculate
the number of doses needed for an order.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. A site reported a problem where a one-time order could not be
discontinued by the provider because it was expired due to the start and
stop date being the same. However, the medication still displayed in Bar
Code Medication Administration (BCMA) V. 1.0 because of the 12-hour rule
for displaying one-time orders on the Virtual Due List.  This patch
corrects this problem by changing the way the stop date for one-time
orders is calculated. There will be a ward parameter, system parameter and
the standard calculation. The hierarchy will be to check the one-time ward
parameter first, if not defined, check the system parameter.  If the
system parameter is not defined, the system will use the continuous order
parameters to determine the stop date, rather than the start and stop date
being equal.  Then, when BCMA marks the medication as 'Given', Inpatient
Medications will expire the order. NOIS# BUT-0501-20609
 
2. Inpatient Medications has been asked to add the BCMA Last Action to the
order view screen.  Users will begin to see BCMA ORDER LAST ACTION
MM/DD/YY HH:MM BCMA ACTION upon installation of this patch on the line
following the Med Route information.  If the line ends with an * that
means that the BCMA Last Action was not made against this order, but
against the previous order this order was created from due to a change or
renewal.
 
3. A problem was found with the date calculation for the start date for
renewal orders in PSJ*5*47. Please note:  PSJ*5*47 should not be removed.
If the frequency for the order was a time other than an even number of
hours and the expected time for the new order to start was either 10am or
8pm, the date/time format stored internally contained a trailing 0.  This
is an invalid date format. This patch corrects this problem.  In addition
to correcting the date calculation, there is a cleanup routine to correct
any problems in the current data. The cleanup has two phases.  First, the
data is analyzed to determine if there are any problems.  When the
analysis is complete, the person who installed the patch will receive a
mail message, "INPATIENT MEDS ORDER CHECK COMPLETED", indicating the check
has completed.  If errors are found, the cleanup is performed and a second
message, "INPATIENT MEDS ORDER CLEANUP COMPLETED", is sent to the
installer indicating that cleanup is complete.  The messages are
informational only.  No action is required.  NOIS# DAY-0701-41935
 
4. With the release of the Pharmacy Ordering Enhancements patches, two
spaces were allowed in the schedule field.  In testing, it was discovered
that a user could enter the two spaces at the end of the schedule and it
was accepted by the software.  The software was not intended to work this
way.  Upon installation of this patch, the trailing spaces will be
stripped off the text the user enters at the schedule prompt.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1.  A site reported a problem with the calculation of the start date for
renewal orders.  If the start date/time calculated fell between midnight
and 1:00am, the time was truncated from the VA FileMan date and time.  The
problem with these orders is that they will not appear on the Bar Code
Medication Administration (BCMA) V. 1.0 Virtual Due List (VDL) nor will
they appear on the Missed Medications Report.  In addition to correcting
the date calculation, there is a cleanup routine to correct any problems
in the current data. The cleanup has two phases.  First, the orders with a
stop date no older than 30 days are analyzed to determine if there are any
problems.  When the analysis is complete, the person who installed the
patch will receive a MailMan message, "INPATIENT MEDS ORDER CHECK
COMPLETED", indicating the check has completed.  If errors are found, the
cleanup is performed and a second message, "INPATIENT MEDS ORDER CLEANUP
COMPLETED", is sent to the installer indicating that cleanup is complete
with a listing of the effected patients and the orders. The list is
provided so that personnel can ensure the patients received their
medications.
 
2.  During testing of the changes for one-time orders it was discovered
that the schedule was overriding the schedule type on Unit Dose orders.
For Unit Dose orders, the schedule type should take precedence.  This
patch corrects this problem.

****************************************************************
 
1. E3R #11794 - RETURN TO MED PROFILE AFTER ORDER ENTRY- The E3R suggests
the following: after order entry, return the user to the profile view of
the patient's orders and require that they quit out of the profile in
order to select a new patient. Justification is that it works this way in
Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 and should work similarly in Inpatient
Medications V. 5.0. This patch will implement the requested functionality.
NOIS# ISL-0800-50420.
 
2. E3R #12370 - FORCE SECOND SCREEN TO DISPLAY WHEN FINISHING ORDERS WITH
ORDER CHECKS. The E3R describes forcing the view of Computerized Patient
Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0 order checks, when present, on screen two of
order finishing regardless of backdoor pharmacy order checks. This patch
will implement the requested functionality.
 
3. The Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] option, following the completion of 
an order, does not perform patient locking at the "Select DRUG:" prompt.
The option continues processing orders for the patient previously selected
but does not maintain a lock on the patient, allowing a pharmacist and
clinician to order meds on the same patient at the same time. This
patch resolves this problem by removing the "Select Drug:" prompt and
forcing users to use the New Order Entry action. NOIS# ISL-0800-50420.
 
4. Several sites have reported problems with the entry of the infusion
rate through CPRS V. 1.0 and the infusion rate returned to CPRS V. 1.0 by
Inpatient Medications V. 5.0. This patch will correct these problems.
NOIS# LOU-0501-42191 and DAY-1298-40645.
 
5. An undefined error, &lt;UNDEFINED&gt;EN+2^PSJO1 occurs during the Order Entry
[PSJU NE] option when a patient name is entered, then New Order Entry
action is selected at the "Select Action:" prompt, then a drug is entered,
then "^" is entered at the "DOSAGE ORDERED:" prompt, and either "^" or ""
are entered at the "Select DRUG:" prompt. This patch fixes this problem by
ensuring required variables are set up regardless of whether the New Order
Entry action is selected before or after the View Profile action.
 
6. A problem was reported with the API that returns the activity log
information to BCMA for Unit Dose orders. The first entry in the activity
log was not being returned. This patch corrects this problem.
 
7. A site reported a problem with the display of Restriction Guidelines
during Order Entry in Inpatient Medications V. 5.0. The change will allow
the user to abort the display with '^' when the display is more than one
page. Platinum project 3R211M-04-180. (PSJDIN)
 
8.  A site reported a problem with the display in the DOSAGE ORDERED
column on the BCMA Virtual Due List.  For certain IV orders, it was
displaying an incorrect amount.  DOSAGE ORDERED is not used for IV
orders; in fact, the field cannot be accessed from the IV view of the
patient's orders. However, when a provider enters an order in CPRS V. 1.0
as a unit dose order, there is a DOSAGE field.  If that order is then
finished in pharmacy as an IV, the data remains in the global but is no
longer accessible.  However, it was still being sent to BCMA in the API.
This patch resolves this problem by no longer sending this in the API.
NOIS# SLC-0801-50680
 
9. A request was made by the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) to
modify an Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 procedure call that returns order
checking information. The modification contained in this patch will help
CPRS accurately associate the CPRS order with its corresponding order
checks and identify the order as having originated from either Inpatient
Medications V. 5.0 or Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0. Patches OR*3*123 and
PSO*7.0*81 must also be installed for this change to go into effect.
The original NOIS submitted to CPRS is DUR-0801-32713. 
 
10. During the testing of the Pharmacy Order Enhancement patches a site 
reported a problem on their IV Fluid orders that were placed through CPRS.
There were times when the additive or solution defaulted in the order 
were inactive.  An additional check was added to PSJHL4 to screen out 
inactive additives and solutions from the ones defaulted into the order.
 
11. A site reported a problem with the validation of day of week
schedules for IV orders.  This patch corrects this problem.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. A site reported receiving an error when attempting to print a
Medication Administration Record (MAR) for an IV order that contained
administration times.  This patch corrects this problem by modifying MAR
print to ignore administration times for IV orders, unless they are
Piggyback, Chemotherapy Piggyback or Intermittent Syringe orders.
NOIS# CLE-0901-41216
 
2. A site reported receiving an error when attempting to edit an order
immediately after copying it to a new order.  The error only occurs when
editing the original order, not the newly copied order.  This patch
corrects the problem by preserving the original order's dispense drug.
NOIS# ANN-1201-40453
 
3. A site reported a problem when running the Patients on Specific
Drug(s) [PSJ PDV] option and selecting List by (O)rderable Item.  The
Inactive Date for the Orderable Item was no longer being displayed as an
identifier.  This patch corrects this problem.  NOIS# PAL-1101-62555.
 
4. A site reported a problem with the Pick List [PSJU PL] option.  After
installing the Pharmacy Ordering Enhancements, each order's Special
Instructions no longer appear on the Pick List.  This patch corrects the
problem by displaying the Special Instructions on the Pick List.
NOIS# WRJ-1201-11762.
 
5. A site reported a problem with the stop date calculation when
finishing IV orders.  The stop date for the one-time orders was being
used for all following orders.  This patch corrects this problem by
excluding one-time orders from the stop date calculation when the IV site
parameter specifies that all orders should have the same stop date.
NOIS# SAG-1201-40283.
 
6. A site reported a problem with the editing of an order's dispense drug.
Multiple dispense drugs can be added to the order, but the ability to edit
or delete incorrect dispense drugs no longer exists.  This patch corrects
this problem by allowing dispense drugs to be edited and deleted.
NOIS# UNY-1001-12315.
 
7. If a pending order can be finished as either Unit Dose or IV, user
with the PSJ RNFINISH key can't finish the order as Unit Dose.  This
patch will allow the nurses to finish Inpatient Med orders as Unit Dose
orders.  NOIS: BHH-0102-40058.

1. A site reported a problem when editing the orderable item in the
Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] option. The stop date is not being set
correctly. This patch corrects this problem by recalculating the stop date
for an order if the orderable item is changed.
NOIS# BOI-1299-51410.
 
2. A site reported receiving an error when attempting to print history to
a printer from the Activity Logs (AL) action of the Inpatient Order Entry
[PSJ OE] option.  This patch corrects this problem and allows the user to
print history to a printer.  NOIS# ALB-0501-50053.
 
3. A site reported a problem where inactive dispense drugs were displayed
during a '?' lookup at the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] option.  This
patch will correct the problem by removing drugs from the display that
have an inactive date prior to the current date.
NOIS# WPB-0901-32173.
 
4. A site reported a problem with the SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS sub-field (#8)
within the UNIT DOSE multiple (#62) in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55).
Edits to this field are not sent properly to the Computerized Patient
Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0 under the following circumstances:
  1) user holds the PSJ RNURSE key and no other pharmacy keys
  2) place a new order with special instructions and accept and verify it
  3) go back in and edit the special instructions (verify option inactive)
The resulting order's special instructions display differently on the Meds
tab and Orders tab in CPRS. This patch corrects the problem.
NOIS# BOI-0901-51460.
 
5. The Inpatient Medications E3R Workgroup approved a change to the
Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] option View Profile activity that would
continue to support placing the DISPENSE DRUG multiple (#2) within the
UNIT DOSE multiple (#62) in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) on screen 1 of
the order view if it is a single entry. If multiple dispense drugs
are entered, all the dispense drugs will be displayed on the second
screen. This patch will implement the requested change.
E3R# 16130.
 
6. During internal testing, it was discovered that there was a problem
with the entry of MED ROUTE in Abbreviated Order Entry.  Even if the
default is accepted for MED ROUTE, a lookup is still shown and a
selection is required. This has been corrected in this patch.
 
7. A site reported a problem with being allowed to edit an order and make
the start date after the stop date.  This patch corrects this problem.
NOIS# WIM-0801-20934
 
8. A site reported a problem with a variable name in the routine
PSJLIVFD being misspelled. This patch corrects this problem.
NOIS# PUG-1101-50620
 
9. During internal testing, it was discovered that in backdoor order
entry, if a one-time schedule was entered, the schedule type was changed
to one-time, but the display didn't reflect the change until after the
user accepted the order.  This patch corrects this problem.

1. A site reported inappropriately receiving the error message, "Dosage
Ordered and Dispense Drug are not compatible" while attempting to finish
an order. This message displayed when the order's dosage contained a
numeric value that appeared in the dose more than once. For example:
1MG/1ML, 2ML/2VIAL, and 3MG/33ML. This patch corrects the problem. NOIS#
MAC-1101-60243.
 
2. A site has requested a report that lists orders containing free
text dosages. The report will be sorted by drug, and the selection
criteria will be a range of dates. Included in the report is the total
number of times the particular free text dosage occurred during the
selected time period, the name of the provider or providers responsible
for entering the free text dosage, and the number of occurrences for each
provider. The Free Text Dosage Report [PSJU DOSAGE REPORT] option has been
added to the Reports Menu [PSJU REPORTS] option.
 
3. A site reported a problem with the Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 labels
printed through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0. If the
Unit Dose order had a schedule type of Fill On Request, the admin times
were not printing on the label printed by CPRS.  This patch corrects this
problem. NOIS# MAN-0200-11846.
 
4. A site reported a problem with the schedule type when finishing
orders.  The problem was that there was an inconsistency between
finishing orders and backdoor order entry.  This patch corrects this
problem.  NOIS# BIG-0901-71799
 
5. Several sites have reported, after the installation of Pharmacy
Ordering Enhancements, that they are unable to use their Quick Codes to
finish IV orders placed through CPRS. This patch corrects this problem.
NOIS# MIW-1101-41809 and POR-1101-52536.
 
6. A technician gets the following message: "...Order deleted....Order
deleted." when trying to enter IV orders at the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ
OE] option. The problem occurs if "^" is entered to stop the VA FileMan
listing of solutions at the "Select SOLUTION:" prompt. Upon receiving "^"
as input, the option behaves as if the "^" was entered at the "SOLUTION:"
prompt and deletes the order. This patch will correct this problem by only
allowing deletion of the order if "^" is entered at the "SOLUTION:"
prompt. Entering "^" at the "'^' TO STOP:" prompt will only abort the VA
FileMan listing. NOIS# AMA-0801-70377.
 
7. In finishing a unit dose order, if the pharmacist edited Dispense
Drug and Dosage Ordered at the same time, a warning message was displayed
stating the dosage did not match, the available dosages list displayed,
and the user became stuck in a loop. This patch will correct this problem.
NOIS# PTH-0102-21320.
 
8. A site reported a problem with administration times when Quick Codes
were used for IV Piggyback orders in the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE]
option. If a schedule is defined for the Quick Code, but no administration
times are defined, and appropriate administration times cannot be derived
from the IV additive, administration times should default from the ward
parameters. The administration times were not defaulting properly from the
ward parameters. This patch corrects the problem.

A site reported a problem with IV orders that were using non-standard
schedules.  If a schedule was Q18H or Q36H, it would appear as due every
24 hours, rather than 18 or 36, respectively.  This would only happen on
IV orders placed through the Computerized Patient Record System V. 1.0
(CPRS).  This patch corrects this problem.  In addition to correcting the
frequency calculation, there is a cleanup routine to correct any problems
in the current data. The cleanup has two phases.  First, the orders with a
start date after the installation of PSJ*5*50. When the analysis is
complete, the person who installed the patch will receive a MailMan
message, "INPATIENT MEDS ORDER CHECK COMPLETED", indicating the check has
completed.  If errors are found, the cleanup is performed and a second
message, "INPATIENT MEDS ORDER CLEANUP COMPLETED", is sent to the
installer indicating that cleanup is complete with a listing of the
effected patients and the orders. The list is provided so that personnel
can ensure the patients received their medications appropriately.

1. If the Orderable Item within a unit dose order is re-matched to a new 
Orderable Item due to dosage form change or any other reason, the new 
Orderable Item will replace the existing Orderable Item in the order when
the current order is renewed. NOIS# ISB-0202-30541.
 
2. Currently, Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 supplies an API #3243,
supporting the call $$ACTIVE^PSJORREN, to Computerized Patient Record
System (CPRS) V. 1.0, which enables them to determine whether an 
Inpatient Medications order is renewable. This functionality will be
changed for IV orders to return a 0 for a non-renewable order and a 1 for
a renewable order. The Unit Dose functionality will not be affected.
 
3. A problem was reported where a site was discontinuing IV and Unit Dose 
orders with a Nature of Order of Duplicate.  When the user viewed the 
orders on the CPRS Orders Tab, the Reason for DC was showing on some 
orders as ORDER CANCELED, ORDER DISCONTINUED, or DUPLICATE.  With the
installation of this patch, the Reason for DC should show as DUPLICATE for
all orders discontinued where the Nature of Order selected is Duplicate.

manner in the NON-VERIFIED ORDERS file (#53.1).  The orders were being 
filed in such a way that the pharmacist couldn't finish them to be 
dispensed from the IV or Unit Dose package. This patch will correct this
problem.  NOIS # BEC-0202-20544 &amp; PAL-0202-61440.
 
2. A site reported a problem with the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE]
option. When viewing a patient's profile, if the patient has no orders to
display, the user is prompted to enter a new patient without being given
the opportunity to continue to edit the current patient. This patch
corrects this problem by returning the user to the Patient Information
screen after displaying the 'NO ORDERS FOUND' message.
NOIS # REN-0202-61475.
 
3. A site reported a problem with the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE]
option. If the Orderable Item was edited, a message was displayed
informing the user that the Dispense Drug and Dosage would be deleted if
the user continued to edit the order, while nothing would change if the
user cancelled the edit. This message was in error as the Dispense Drug
and Dosage were deleted regardless of the user's actions. This patch
corrects this problem by displaying the warning message earlier in the
edit to allow the user to cancel the edit before the order is changed.

4. A site reported a problem with the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE]
option. Under certain circumstances, the patient's order profile could not
be viewed because the VP View Profile action was not selectable. This
patch corrects this problem by allowing the profile view of the patient's
orders to be viewed when appropriate.
NOIS # STX-0202-72021.
 
5. A site reported a problem with the strength of the drug displaying on 
the Orders Tab in CPRS for orders that had been renewed.  The problem 
resulted from message segments longer than 245 characters not being split 
appropriately.  This patch will correct this problem.

1.  A site reported a problem with an inconsistency in the the calculation
of stop dates for one-time Outpatient IV orders.  This patch corrects 
this problem.  NOIS#  SPO-0102-50221
 
2.  During internal testing it was discovered that an IV schedule of 
ONETIME was not being marked as a one-time order when sent to Bar Code 
Medication Administration V. 1.0 (BCMA).  This patch corrects this 
problem.
 
3.  A site reported a problem with renewing IV orders.  If the original 
order was expired and the Start Date on the new order was edited, the 
Stop Date on the original order was also changed.  This patch corrects 
this problem.  NOIS#  HUN-0102-20878
 
4.  A site reported a problem with one-time IV labels printing in the
scheduled label job every day, rather than only one time.  This patch
corrects this problem by only allowing reprints once the label has been
printed for a one-time IV order.  NOIS#  ALB-0102-51931, PHO-0202-60736
 
5.  A site reported a problem with finishing IV orders using the Order
Entry (IV) [PSJI ORDER] option. If a new order was created as a result of
edits made during finishing, the "Instructions:" prompt continued to
display the instructions from the old order. The new order is unique, and
instructions from the old order may not apply to the new order. This
patch corrects the problem by removing the old instructions.

7. A site reported a problem with the way IV orders were displayed in the
profile view of a patient's orders within the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ
OE] option. When an IV order with more than one solution was displayed,
each solution showed the infusion rate for the order, incorrectly making
it appear each solution would be infused at that rate. This patch
corrects this problem by only displaying the infusion rate next to the
first solution.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
As a part of the Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Extract enhancement
project, two new fields were added to the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55).
They are FIRST SERVICE DATE (#.07) and ACTUAL/HISTORICAL FLAG (#.08).
With the addition of these two fields, Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 and
Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 have been modified to set this information
when the first order for a patient becomes active.
 
This project consists of three patches combined in a master build.
Installation of this master build should be coordinated among the three
packages affected since only one installation is necessary.  The patches,
in order of install, are:
 
      PSS*1*52  PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT V. 1.0
      PSJ*5*68  INPATIENT MEDICATIONS V. 5.0
      PSO*7*95  OUTPATIENT PHARMACY V. 7.0
 
Upon completion of the installation of these three patches, the master
build will start a routine that will build the two new fields from
historical data in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55).  When the build is
complete, the user who initiated the install and the members of the
PSU PBM mail group will receive a message with a subject of BUILD OF FIRST
PHARMACY SERVICE INFO COMPLETE.

1. A problem was reported by a site where the free text dosage ordered
entered into an order in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) was not
showing in the dosage ordered field in Inpatient Medications.  The problem
was that Inpatient was checking for the free text dosage ordered to be 20
characters or less, this was not compatible with what is allowed in CPRS.
The Inpatient Medications check was changed to accept 60 characters or
less, which is compatible with CPRS. NOIS # DDC-0402-50270.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 1. The Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) V. 2.0 release provides 
 enhancements to Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0, and Inpatient 
 Medications V. 5.0. The BCMA V. 2.0 release expands and improves the
 process of medication administration, especially in the area of IV
 medications.
  
 In support of this, Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 and PDM V. 1.0 have 
 added the ability to print barcode identifiers on IV labels, IV order
 verification and the ability to receive done priority orders via the CPRS
 Med Order button in BCMA V. 2.0.
  
 This project consists of two patches and a new version of BCMA that work
 together to accomplish these goals listed in order of install:
  
      PSS*1*46  PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT V. 1.0
      PSJ*5*58  INPATIENT MEDICATIONS V. 5.0
      BAR CODE MED ADMIN 2.0  BAR CODE MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION V. 2.0
  
 2. Two sites reported a problem with comments from one IV order
 showing up on a different IV order. Since edits to provider comments are
 no longer allowed interactively from within Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ
 OE] option, this patch corrects the problem by removing the code that
 performs updates to provider comments. NOIS# MOU-0100-30945 and
 MAC-1100-61760.
  
 3. A site reported a problem with an IV order appearing on the profile 
 view as a Continuous order when it was a One-time order. This patch 
 corrects this problem. NOIS# DUB-0102-32272.
  
 4. A correction was made to only allow nurse and pharmacist users to 
 Speed Discontinue IV orders.  
  
 5. A correction was made to allow Speed Discontinue Unit Dose orders if 
 the status was not "Discontinued", "Discontinued (Edit)" or "Expired".
  
 6. If a technician or a ward clerk edited a Unit Dose order and caused a
 Non-Verified order to be created, the user was able to discontinue the 
 Non-Verified order even if the user parameter "ALLOW USER TO D/C ORDERS:"
 was set to NO, which means the user should only be allowed to mark orders
 to be discontinued. This patch corrects this problem.
  
 7. A site reported an error occurred when copying a Unit Dose order.
 If the user parameter "ORDER ENTRY PROCESS:" was set to WARD and an edit
 was made during copy, the user would error out while accepting the 
 change. This patch corrects this problem.
  
 8. The Test Control Codes (IV) [PSJI CONTROL CODES] option has been added
 to the Label Menu (IV) [PSJI LBLMENU] option. This option allows the user
 to print an IV label for the purpose of verifying their control code
 definition. An entire label is not printed, simply a bar code and one
 line of underscores.
  
 9. A couple of sites reported that the schedule did not display on the
 profile for IV orders when using the Inpatient Profile [PSJ PR] option.
 This patch corrects this problem. NOIS# CON-0302-12151 and 
 MAR-0402-21639.
  
 10. A site reported receiving a null subscript error when an IV order 
 came from Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0 and Inpatient
 Medications V. 5.0 was unable to determine the correct solution to place
 in the pending order. The order created had a volume but no solution.
 NOIS# WAS-0402-21482.
  
 11. While trying to reproduce a problem reported by a site with the 
 display of Special Instructions we discovered a problem that could occur
 on orders placed through CPRS when copying Provider Comments into the
 Special Instructions field. If the Provider Comments contained a
 character string that exceeded 70 characters without having a space in 
 it the user couldn't see the last several characters on the screen. This
 patch corrects this problem.
  
 12. Post-Install will do the following:
 IV verification is now required with the PSJ*5*58 patch. For orders that 
 were entered prior to the installation of this patch, an algorithm was 
 designed to determine the verifying pharmacist. The verifying user IEN 
 is stored in the VERIFYING PHARMACIST sub-field (#140) of the IV multiple
 (#100) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55), which was added with patch 
 PSS*1*46. The DATE VERIFIED BY PHARMACIST sub-field (#141)
 of the IV multiple (#100) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55), which has
 also been added with patch PSS*1*46, will reflect the installation date
 and time.
  
 The Activity Log for the IV Order stored the user name in free text.
 During this conversion, the free text user name is compared to the NEW
 PERSON file (#200). If there is an exact and unique match, then the IEN
 for this person is stored in the USER sub-field (#.06) of the ACTIVITY 
 LOG multiple (#40) of the IV multiple (#100) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file
 (#55) that was added with patch PSS*1*46.
  
 If the software is able to determine the user's IEN, for all affected IV 
 orders, and no intervention is required, the MailMan message generated 
 by the conversion will contain only the conversion information. The
 subject of this message will be: PSJ*5*58 IV Verification.
  
 When the software is unable to determine the user's IEN, the MailMan
 message generated by this conversion will instruct the installer
 to assign the Correct Change User Names in IV activity log [PSJI ACTIVITY
 LOG VA200] option to a holder of the PSJI MGR security key who is 
 familiar with the Pharmacy users to allow them to correct the unresolved
 names. The subject of this message will be: PSJ*5*58 IV Verification.
  
 Once all of the unresolved names are resolved, another MailMan message 
 is generated. This message will instruct the user who ran the Correct
 Change User Names in IV activity log [PSJI ACTIVITY LOG VA200] option to
 contact IRM to remove the option. The subject of this message is Changed
 names in IV orders.
  
 An entry is made in the ACTIVITY LOG multiple (#40) of the IV
 multiple (#100) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) to indicate the
 verification action was performed during the installation of this patch. 
 The user in the log entry is the verifying pharmacist determined during
 the conversion.

the Restriction/Guideline(s). This patch corrects the problem by clearing
the screen before the drug interactions are displayed.
NOIS # BIR-0302-32554
 
2. A site reported a problem with finishing IV Quick Code orders in the
Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] option. When an IV Quick Code was used to
finish an order, the Provider Comments did not appear in the Other Print
Info when the prompt "Copy the Provider Comments into Other Print Info
(Yes/No/!):" was answered in an affirmative manner. This patch corrects
the problem by retaining copied Provider Comments in the Other Print Info
if the IV Quick Code has no Other Print Info. If the IV Quick Code does
contain Other Print Info, it will appear in the order's Other Print Info.
NOIS # MIN-1101-42563
 
3. A site reported a problem with IV Quick Codes in IV Piggyback orders.
If there are no administration times present in the Quick Code, Additive,
or Ward Parameters, the user is prompted for a schedule with associated
administration times. In this instance, the user selected a schedule, but
the selected schedule's administration times were not saved with the
order. This patch corrects the problem by using the administration times
associated with the selected schedule when appropriate.
NOIS # HWH-0102-41454
 
4. A site reported a problem with the Free Text Dosage Report [PSJU
DOSAGE REPORT] option. When a free text dosage was encountered that had
been ordered by over thirty different physicians, the report did  not run
to completion. This patch corrects the problem by allowing an unlimited
number of physicians to appear for each on dosage the report.

8. A site reported a problem with a one-time order that didn't expire 
after it had been administered.  The problem occurred because the schedule
type was Fill on Request.  This patch corrects this problem.  NOIS: 
NCH-0602-41182.
 
9. During internal testing, it was discovered that the BCMA API that 
returns Activity Log information was not sending the user's internal 
entry number for IV orders.  This patch corrects this problem.
 
10. When the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) has a schedule 
contained "PRN", the Unit Dose and IV orders will not display on the Bar 
Code Medication Administration (BCMA) V. 2.0 if the Virtual Due List 
(VDL) had only the PRN box checked.  This patch will send the correct 
information to BCMA to display the order in the PRN session.  NOIS: 
SAM-0702-22338.
 
11. A site reported a problem with being able to see BCMA ORDER LAST 
ACTION on active renewed orders.  The BCMA ORDER LAST ACTION was 
available on the old order, but not on the newly created order.  This 
patch will correct this problem.  NOIS: MWV-0902-21008.

When performing drug lookups, two issues were identified. First, the user 
was not aware of which item was being matched. For example, was the match 
for the GENERIC NAME of the drug or was it the SYNONYM. The second issue 
had to do with the search matching to the NATIONAL DRUG CLASS NAME first, 
before checking for a GENERIC NAME. 
 
This patch makes two changes to the drug lookup. First, the search will 
display the item being searched on. Second, if a match is found on an 
item, but the user doesn't select one of the matches displayed, the 
search will continue through all other items. A sample screen display

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 This patch requires the installation of Bar Code Medication
 Administration (BCMA) V. 2.0.
 
 1. A site reported that continuous IV orders such as admixtures and
 hyperals do not display on the Virtual Due List (VDL) in BCMA V. 2.0 when
 they are renewed. If the DEFAULT START DATE CALCULATION field (#.05)
 in the INPATIENT WARD PARAMETERS file (#59.6) is not set to '2  USE NOW
 AS DEFAULT', the renewal order's default start date may be set far enough
 into the future to allow the order to fall off the VDL. The original
 order may also expire at any time before the new order's start date and
 time, giving the appearance on the VDL that no medications are being
 actively administered, when actually there is a bag infusing and another
 bag scheduled to start.
 This patch will correct the problem by changing the way the start date
 and time are calculated for continuous IV renewals. If the order being
 renewed is a continuous IV, and the order does not contain a schedule,
 the default start date and time for the order will be set to NOW.
 NOIS #UNY-0802-10109. 
 
 2. If the pharmacist made an edit during the finishing of an IV piggyback
 order that result in a new order, the original order was not 
 discontinued. This was cause by a leftover variable. To recreate this 
 problem, enter a new backdoor order and answer the following question 
 "Is this O.K.: NO//" with a "^". Then select a pending IV order and
 finish it. This patch will correct the problem. NOIS #LIT-0902-72062.

1. A site reported a problem with the option 14 Day MAR [PSJU 14D MAR]
where nursing staff print blank mar's for prn's, but they are now having
to do it patient by patient instead of by ward.  It works fine by patient,
but will print nothing for prn's (blank) by ward.  This patch corrects
this problem.  NOIS# DUB-0902-31426.
 
2. Inpatient Medications provides an application programmer interface 
(API) to Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) that determines 
whether a schedule is required for an order placed using the INPATIENT 
MEDS dialog.  A site reported a problem with an order received from CPRS 
where a schedule should have required and wasn't.  This patch corrects 
this problem.  NOIS# BIR-0902-31838.
 
3. A site reported a problem with an IV order being created without all 
the appropriate information.  The problem was the result of a nurse 
verifying a non-verified unit dose order through CPRS.  The unit dose 
order would become active, the routine, which allowed this, was missing a 
quit and the code to create an IV order would be executed without 
appropriate information, resulting in the bad IV order.  This patch 
corrects this problem.  NOIS# MOU-0902-30038.
 
4. A site reported a problem with the Activity Log from a non-verified 
unit dose order was not copied over to the active unit dose order when 
nurse verification took place through the CPRS verification option.  This 
patch corrects this problem.  NOIS# NOL-0902-70884.
 
5. A site reported a problem with the display of pending hyperal orders.  
The orders were only displaying a single line on the CPRS orders tab 
instead of all the additives and solution contained in the order.  This 
patch corrects this problem.  NOIS# BHS-1002-10031.

1. The allergy/adverse reaction is currently displayed as &lt;A&gt; on the
patient profile and order view.  This patch will display the Crises,
Warnings, Allergy and Directive as &lt;CWAD&gt;.  A new hidden action CWAD is
added to display any patient's Crises, Warnings, Alerts, or advanced
Directives on file.
 
2. It was requested in the E3Rs #11177 and #12382 that the flagging
capability that is available in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)
be available through the Inpatient Medications options.  This patch
accomplishes the addition of this functionality.  In order to use this
functionality, patch OR*3*141 must be installed as well.
 
3. The order view was not displaying on the Patient Profiles for Unit Dose
orders.  Steps for testing: From the Unit Dose Order Entry [PSJU NE]
option, select a patient and then select an order from that patient's
profile. After the order view appears, exit to the Main Menu. Next, choose
the PAtient Profile (Unit Dose) [PSJU PR] option and include the expanded
view on the report.  The expanded view of the order should display on the
profile.
 
4. Beginning with Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 patch PSJ*5*58, the
barcodes are printed on the IV labels.  Barcode ID - Return and Destroy
(IV) [PSJI RETURN BY BARCODE ID] option was added to help pharmacy with
the return and destroy of specific IV labels.  This new functionality was
requested by E3R #17117.
 
5. The BCMA ORDER LAST ACTION information was not available on patient 
profiles of Unit Dose orders.  This patch will display it on these 
options: Inpatient Profile [PSJ PR], PAtient Profile (Unit Dose) [PSJU 
PR] and Patient Profile (Extended) [PSJ EXTP].
 
6. It was requested in E3Rs # 12841 and # 10796 that Inpatient
Medications orders display the signature status of the order next to
the provider's name.  This patch in conjunction with OR*3*141 accomplishes
this functionality.  If the order has been electronically signed via the
CPRS V. 1.0 package, [es] will appear after the provider's name.  If the
order has not been electronically signed or if OR*3*141 has not been
installed the user will see the lowercase abbreviation for the Nature of
Order enclosed in the brackets after the provider's name (i.e. Written -
[w], Telephoned - [p], Verbal - [v], Policy - [i], Electronically Entered
- [e], or Service Correction [s]).
 
7. CPRS GUI version displays "No Allergy Assessment" when no allergy is
found on file.  It was requested in E3R #13013 that Inpatient Medications
V. 5.0 use the same wording when patient allergies are displayed. This
patch accomplishes this requested functionality.
 
8. A problem was discovered with the way certain Day of the Week schedules
were handled during order entry. System derived administration times may
have defaulted into orders in an improper format if the order was created
using a Day of the Week administration schedule with no administration
times defined. The incorrect administration time stored with the order may
have been in the form of a single digit number or a three digit number.
This patch corrects this problem. NOIS ISB-0902-30741.
 
9. A site reported a problem with IV Fluid orders entered via CPRS where 
additives that were not marked for IV Fluid Order Entry in the IV 
ADDITIVES file (#52.6) were not being displayed in the pending order.  
This patch corrects this problem. NOIS MAR-0902-21076.
 
10. When a pharmacist finished and verified an IV Fluid order as an IV 
Piggyback order, it did not show up in CPRS's Active View.  This occurred 
only when the  "ALLOW AUTO-VERIFY FOR USER:" prompt in the Inpatient User
Parameters Edit [PSJ SEUP] option is set to "No".  This patch will correct
this problem. NOIS LIT-1002-70444.

1. IV orders were originally entered through Computerized Patient Record 
System (CPRS) and finished in Pharmacy, the completed orders were then 
edited through backdoor pharmacy options, the changes made were not 
reflected in CPRS. NOIS: HUN-1202-21612.
 
Steps to recreate:
 
    1. Provider creates an IV order in CPRS.
    2. Pharmacist (auto-verify off) finishes the order, the order is a 
       non-verified order.
    3. Pharmacist changes the strength in the additive but doesn't verify 
       it. This leaves it in a Non-Verified status.
    4. The new strength does not appear on CPRS side.
 
2. When the OTHER PRINT INFO field (#21) was entered or modified for a 
Non-Verified IV order, this data was not being sent to CPRS. This patch 
will correct it.
 
3. An Inpatient Meds order is finished as an admixture with auto-verify 
turned off, this creates a non-verified order. When the non-verified 
order displays, a starred field is edited, and the order is accepted; 
this causes a new order to be created, but the original non-verified 
order is not discontinued. The profile displays two non-verified orders, 
because a variable was not being updated correctly. This patch corrects 
this problem.

 1. A site reported a problem with an IV renewal order. The order had been
 renewed from the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 2.0, and
 after the pending renewal order was verified, an error occurred. The
 error was due to an incorrect pointer to the pending order number that
 remained after the verification was complete. This patch corrects the
 problem by initialzing and reloading the new verified order after the
 order has been verified. NOIS BRX-1102-12101.
 
 2. A site reported a problem with extra labels printing with their 
 scheduled IV labels. The extra labels contained the message 'NO PIGGYBACK
 DATA'. This patch corrects the problem by printing this label only once 
 per label run, rather than for each patient. NOIS PAL-0902-61209.
 
 3. A problem with the RETurns and Destroyed Entry (IV) [PSJI RETURNS]
 option was discovered by a member of development. The manual entry of a
 BCMA ID is allowed, but the option does not recognize lower case alpha
 characters within the BCMA ID. This patch changes this functionality to
 allow the input of upper or lower case alpha characters when a BCMA ID is
 entered in this option.

1. The routine ^PSJORREN was included with patch PSJ*5*89 to correct the
problem of renewing a Unit Dose order with a 0 (zero) value stored in the
ORDERABLE ITEM field (#108) of the UNIT DOSE multiple (#62) of the
PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55). This routine is included in this patch
(PSJ*5*91) to make sure that when Bar Code Medication Administration
(BCMA) V. 2.0 is installed after patch PSJ*5*89 sites will have the
correct version. The second line will be updated with this patch number
but the routine checksum will be the same as listed in PSJ*5*89.
 
2. The routine ^PSJORRE1 is included in this patch to address SQA issue
with the incorrect DBIA number documented in the reference. The checksum
will not change.
 
3. Routine ^PSJDCHK is included to comment out references to the
PATIENT file (#55) that are no longer used.
 
4. The SCHEDULE INTERVAL field (#.17) from the IV sub-file (#55.01) of the
PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) is not stored consistently for Day of Week
schedules if the user did not have Auto Verify turned on. This patch will
schedules if the user did not have Auto Verify turned on. This patch will
store a "D" in this field for the Day of Week schedule. This patch
includes a modification to an Application Programmer Interface (API) to
BCMA V. 2.0 to send the correct schedule type for IV orders.
NOIS# NYH-1002-10449.
 
5. Unit Dose orders created in Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA)
V. 2.0 using the Med Order Button do not appear on the Due List. These
orders are being created with a frequency of zero, which is not a valid
frequency. This patch will correct the problem so that these orders will
be created with the proper frequency for One Time orders.
NOIS# MIN-1202-40902.
 
6. A clean-up routine will identify orders with a frequency of zero and
make corrections, if appropriate. The person installing this patch will
receive a MailMan message with the subject PSJ*5*91 INPATIENT MEDS
FREQUENCY ORDER CLEANUP COMPLETED. This message will inform the user how
many orders with a zero frequency were found and corrected. An order's
frequency will only be corrected if it meets all the following criteria:
the Frequency is zero, the Stop Date is equal to the Start Date, the
Schedule is STAT or NOW, and the Priority is Done.
 
7. A site reported receiving an error while editing a Unit Dose order in
the Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW] option. Edits were made to the
order that caused a new order to be created, and this cycle was repeated
several times until an error occurred which interrupted the process. This
patch will prevent this error from occurring.
NOIS# BRX-1202-11956.
 
8. A site reported receiving an undefined error when attempting to place
an order using the Med Order Button in Bar Code Medication Administration

9. A site reported a problem with the Drug (Cost and/or Amount) [PSJU
DCT] option.  When selecting by Orderable Item, the inactive date was not
being displayed beside the name.  This patch corrects this problem.
NOIS# CLL-0103-40519.
 
10. Sites reported a problem where active IV orders were being created
with an IV Room of zero (0).  This created a problem of no IV labels
being printed for these orders.  This patch corrects this problem.
NOIS# HAM-0103-22051 &amp; CPH-0103-41307.
 
11. A site reported an error that occurred when two users simultaneously
attempted to print to a non-spooled printer. The output should have been
directed to the terminal screen, but instead was queued to an output
device of 'HOME'. This queued job will cause an inappropriate device
error, or it will create duplicate label log entries until the job is
killed. This patch will correct the problem by converting the name of the
output device from the word HOME to the user's home device.
NOIS# DAY-0103-42177 &amp; CLE-0203-40500.
 
12. A site reported a problem with an order having the nurse verification
indicated in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0, but no in
Inpatient Medications V. 5.0. This patch corrects this problem.
NOIS# HUN-0902-22266.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 This patch is compatible with Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA)
 V. 1.0 as well as BCMA V. 2.0, and may be installed in environments
 containing either version.
 
 1. A site reported a problem with the way an IV Quick Order's schedule
 was handled when ordered as a Chemotherapy IV with a Chemotherapy Type
 of Piggyback. The schedule defined in the IV Quick Code did not default
 into the order when the IV Quick Code was used with an IV Type of
 Chemotherapy. This patch corrects the problem by properly defaulting the
 schedule with Chemotherapy IV orders. NOIS MIN-1002-40243.
 
 2. When a patient movement is deleted and orders are reinstated, a mail
 message is sent to a user group to inform the users of reinstated orders
 and those that are not reinstated.  This patch changed the mail message
 from regular to Priority mail to ensure the users see it.
 NOIS WPB-0902-30314.
 
 3. A site reported a problem with scheduled IV labels for orders with
 Day of the Week schedules such as MO-WE-FR@0900. Labels were printing
 for the scheduled administrations every day, instead of printing labels
 exclusively for the days defined in the schedule. This patch corrects
 the problem by printing labels only for scheduled doses.
 NOIS HIN-0902-41529.
 
4. A site reported receiving the message "Nonstandard schedule" when they 
 attempted to enter an order for a continuous IV Admixture using an IV 
 Quick Code that did not contain a schedule. This message should not 
 display when the schedule field does not contain a value, regardless of 
 whether or not an IV Quick Code is used. This patch corrects the problem 
 by preventing this message from displaying when the schedule field is 
 empty or null. NOIS BIG-1102-70679.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 1. A site reported receiving an error message, 'string too long', while
 attempting to finish a pending Unit Dose order. The error occurred after
 a number of edits to the Special Instructions were made and accepted.
 After each edit, 'Yes' was entered in response to the 'Flag the Special
 Instructions (Yes/No):' prompt. As the Special Instructions were
 flagged, a new flag was created and added to all the previous flags. This
 patch corrects the problem by taking previously flagged Special
 Instructions into account and ensuring only one flag exists for each
 order. NOIS: MIW-1002-40270.
 
 2. A request was made to modify the Pre-Exchange Report to put each
 patient on a separate page. This patch implements this modification by
 printing the report by patient immediately after order entry processing
 is completed for each patient. Included in this change is a new field,
 the PRE-EXCHANGE REPORT DEVICE field (#4) in the INPATIENT WARD
 PARAMETERS file (#59.6). This parameter is a pointer to the DEVICE file
 (#3.5), and will contain the default print device for the report. A
 post-install routine has also been included to populate the new parameter
 for each ward with a value that will print the report to the screen. This
 value may then be changed to a print device, or deleted to disable the
 report for that ward. E3R 17161.
 
 3. A site reported a problem with the Start Date/Time of a Unit Dose
 renewal order. The problem occurred under the following conditions:
 An order's medication was administered at 0949, prior to its next 
 scheduled administration of 1000. That same order's Stop Date/Time
 was 1200, which was after the 1000 administration time that was given
 early, but before the next scheduled administration time of 1800.
 The order is then renewed at 0956. The calculated Start Date/Time is
 after the order expires, so the ward parameters are used, making the
 Start Date/Time equal to NOW. The renewal order's Start Date/Time
 became 0956, which caused the order to hit the 1000 administration time
 again, seven minutes after the last administration. This patch corrects
 this particular problem by making the default Start Date/Time of the
 renewal order equal to the Stop Date/Time of the original renewed order
 if the calculated start time is after the Stop Date/Time of the original
 order. NOIS: MAR-1002-20455.
 
 4. A site reported a pharmacist could not finish a pending order as Unit 
 Dose when the prompt 'COMPLETE THIS ORDER AS IV OR UNIT DOSE?' was
 answered with 'U'. The pharmacist held the Pharmacy Technician Key, and 
 as a result the software considered the Pharmacist a Pharmacy Technician.
 This patch corrects this problem by allowing pharmacists possessing the
 Pharmacy Technician Key to complete these orders as Unit Dose orders.
 NOIS: CHA-1101-31456.
 
 5. The activity log was not updated to record the nurse verification 
 action taken from CPRS on an active IV order. This patch will correct 
 this issue. NOIS: NCH-1202-40194.
 
 6. The patient profile displayed "No Allergy Assessment" when the 
 patient did not have any allergies but have adverse reaction identified. 
 This patch will correct this problem. NOIS: BRX-0103-12347.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. A site reported a problem where an order was showing on the pick list 
with OI under the Units Needed heading.  Upon investigation of the order 
it was found that the order was logged in between midnight and one minute 
after midnight, this caused a problem because the Inpatient Medications 
software was only using the first 12 characters of the date time, so the 
login date had no time.  The ward parameter for the ward was set to now 
which set the start date/time for the order to a date and no time.  This 
caused the problem with the pick list, the software was unable to 
calculate the units needed and used OI to indicate there was a problem 
with the order.  This patch corrects this problem.  NOIS# SPO-0103-51804.
 
2. A site reported an error when flagging a pending IV order from the 
patient's profile. If the patient had not been admitted to a ward, the 
software incorrectly processed the order as an outpatient order. This
patch corrects the problem by correctly processing the flagging
information. NOIS# HUN-0303-21424.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
A problem was reported with the Automatic Pharmacy Statistics [PSU 
PBM AUTO] option receiving an undefined variable error.  The problem was
that the LAST WARD field (#68) of the UNIT DOSE multiple (#62) of the
PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) had a text value instead of a numeric value.
The patients where the problem occurred all had been admitted to
observation and then discharged and re-admitted to the hospital.  New
functionality was added to the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)
to allow the orders that had been discontinued by the patient's discharge
from observation to be automatically re-instated upon the patient's later
re-admission to the hospital via an application programmer interface (API)
to Inpatient Medications.  This patch corrects this API to only allow a
numeric value for the LAST WARD field to be passed in this API.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. Several sites reported that the default start/stop dates for complex
orders were causing confusion. The confusion is caused by the fact that
the current stop/start dates don't reflect the duration for the order
entered in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0. The dates
that reflect the duration are currently displayed on the screen as the
requested dates, but they are not the defaults. This patch corrects this
problem by using the requested start/stop dates as the defaults for
complex orders, and adding the duration to the patient profile display.
The system calculated dates are still displayed on the screen for
informational purposes. NOIS: ATG-0202-32014, SPO-0302-51163, and
BHS-0103-10826.
 
2. The EXPIRE ALL ORDERS ON SAME DAY field (#.105) in the IV ROOM file
(#59.5) is currently not evaluated in determining stop dates for IV
orders. This patch corrects this problem by evaluating the field and
calculating the appropriate stop date.  NOIS: ISB-0502-32152.
 
3. For schedules with long intervals, such as 48 hours, there was a
problem with the calculation of the first dose when orders were entered in
CPRS. This caused an inconsistency between the expected first dose
displayed to the provider and the actual time the order became available
for administration. This patch corrects this problem.
NOIS: ATG-0402-31444, LOM-1201-62023, REN-1101-61894.
 
4. A site reported a problem when entering orders with an admin time of
23 and a schedule interval greater than 23 hours. The start time/expected
first dose was being changed to 24. This patch corrects this problem.
NOIS: BAY-0102-32400
 
5. A site reported a problem with the calculation of the stop date on a
renewal order. If the start date of the order was greater than the current
date, the SAME STOP DATE ON ALL ORDERS field (#.04) in the INPATIENT WARD
PARAMETERS file (#59.6) was ignored and the patient's default stop date
was calculated too far in the future. This patch corrects this problem by
changing the default stop date calculation to be based on the current
date, rather than the start date of the order. The patient's default stop
date will now be updated when an order is finished/accepted rather than
waiting until after it is verified. NOIS: CTX-0502-70557
 
6. E3R 12716 requested a change to the way an IV order's Stop Date is
calculated. The DAY (nD) or DOSE (nL) LIMIT field (#.05) in the PHARMACY
ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) was not previously evaluated during the
calculation of an IV order's Stop Date. This patch will include this field
when calculating an IV order's Stop Date. The Stop Date will continue to
be calculated by finding the shortest duration between the appropriate
parameters contained in PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7), IV ADDITIVES
file (#52.6), and the IV ROOM file (#59.5). E3R: 12716
 
7. A site reported an intermittent problem in which Provider Comments
would incorrectly copy from one order to another during the finishing
process. This patch corrects the problem by ensuring that the order
from which Provider Comments are retrieved is the same as the order being
finished. IND-0502-41166
 
8. A site reported a problem that occurred during the finishing process.
Finishing an order with an IV Quick Code that did not contain a schedule
could cause an error, which would abruptly halt the user's process. This
patch corrects this problem.  MAD-0402-42408
 
9. In the past, a user was allowed to renew a Unit Dose order from the
Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 without an active Orderable Item tied to the
order. This patch will inform the user that the order could not be
renewed.
 
10. A site reported a problem with a report that displays orders verified
during a given time period. Some orders did not appear on the report due
to trailing zeroes on the DATE VERIFIED BY PHARMACIST sub-field (#141) in
the IV multiple (#100) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55). This patch
corrects the problem by removing the trailing zeroes from the internal
date. NOIS: CLL-0103-40447
 
11. A site reported they were unable to discontinue IV orders from the
Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0. The problem was caused
by an interaction with test patch DI*22*121. This patch will prevent the
problem from occurring. NOIS: TAM-0303-30859
 
12. During internal testing a problem was discovered with the way Nurse
Verification was recorded in the Activity Log when the verification was
done from the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0. This
patch corrects the problem by accurately recording the event in the
Activity Log.
 
13. A site reported an undefined error in the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ
OE] option that was the result of an interaction with Class III McKesson
software. This patch corrects the problem. NOIS: MIW-0503-40707.

 1. A site reported a problem with the manual reinstatement of
 auto-discontinued inpatient IV orders. A pharmacist was not able to
 manually reinstate an order if the patient had an active order with the
 same IV additive. This patch corrects the problem by allowing orders
 with duplicate additives to be reinstated manually. The software will
 continue to prevent orders with duplicate IV additives from being
 automatically reinstated. NOIS: TNV-0103-31207.
 
 2. A site reported a problem with the SIte Parameters (IV) [PSJI SITE
 PARAMETERS] option. The default label device is not loaded from the
 IV Room that is selected for edit, it is loaded from the IV Room that the
 user enters when initially logging in. If the user does not change the
 label device, this incorrect default label device value will be stored
 with the edited IV Room. This patch corrects the problem by ensuring the
 label device and report device are loaded from the IV Room that was
 selected for edit. NOIS: CLE-0203-40814.
 
3. When a patient movement is deleted and orders are reinstated, a mail
 message is sent to a user group to inform the users of reinstated orders
 and those that were not reinstated. This patch changes the type of
 message that is sent when order reinstatement is attempted in Bar Code
 Medication Administration (BCMA) V. 2.0 from regular to priority.
 NOIS: WPB-0902-30314.
 
 4. A site reported a problem with the Inpatient Profile [PSJ PR] option.
 The Special Instructions incorrectly displayed as an internal numeric
 date. Example: Special Instructions: 3030219.204644. This patch
 corrects the problem by properly displaying the Special Instructions.
 NOIS: BAY-0203-31638.
 
 5. A site has identified a potential problem with the Barcode ID - Return
 and Destroy (IV) [PSJI RETURN BY BARCODE ID] option. It appears that this
 option is adding to the dispensed total, rather than the appropriate
 returned, recycled and destroyed totals. This patch corrects the problem
 by correctly recording the action, enabling the action to be accurately
 reported in the Drug Cost Report (132 COLUMNS) (IV)
 [PSJI DRUG COST REPORT] option. NOIS: CLL-0403-40228.
 
 6. A site reported a problem with the Scheduled Labels (IV) [PSJI LBLS]
 option. The background job that prints the labels occasionally becomes
 stuck in a loop when the print process encounters a patient with active
 IV orders but no labels to print. The background job processes data and
 writes NO PIGGYBACK DATA or NO ADMIXTURE DATA to a spool file, but no
 labels print. The print process eventually must be killed. This patch
 corrects the problem by allowing the print process to generate the NO
 PIGGYBACK DATA and NO ADMIXTURE DATA messages without entering an
 infinite loop. NOIS: MEM-0403-71631.
 
 7. A site reported an error that occurred when an additive with an IV
 Quick Code was added to an IV order that already contained multiple
 additives. This patch corrects the problem by properly processing IV
 Quick Codes when multiple additives are present. NOIS: BRX-0503-10289.
 
 8. Several sites reported the screen would hang indefinitely when trying
 to open a patient's record in BCMA V. 2.0. This patch corrects the
 problem. NOIS: PAL-1102-61818.
 
 9. A site reported a problem with additives printing on IV Admixture
 labels. Additives that were flagged to print on only one label per day
 were printing on multiple labels each day. This patch corrects the
 problem. NOIS: NCH-0103-41471.
 
 10. A site reported that the exclamation point, which is used to flag
 Special Instructions, is not removed from BCMA V. 2.0 when a patient's
 Special Instructions are changed from flagged to not flagged.

The problem occurred for orders with local possible dosages, where the
 strength and unit were defined. This patch corrects this problem by 
 sending the local possible dosage information, if available.
 
 2. A site reported receiving an error while attempting to discontinue 
 a renewal IV order from the Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW]
 option. The error occurred when an update of the order was sent to the 
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 2.0. This patch corrects the

This project consists of 12 patches that work together to create a new
Clinical Reminders index global. The purpose of this index is to provide
rapid access to clinical data. All of the standard Clinical Reminders
finding types are included in the index.
 
The 12 patches that comprise this project are:
 
 PXRM*1.5*12
 DG*5.3*478
 GMPL*2*27
 GMRV*4*15
 LR*5.2*295
 OR*3*157
 PSS*1*62
 PSJ*5*90
 PSO*7*118
 PX*1*119
 RA*5*33
 YS*5.01*77
 
 The purpose of this patch (PSJ*5*90) is to lay the groundwork for these 
 changes by modifying the Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 routines to set the
 cross-references to create the new indices if PXRM*1.5*12 has been
 installed. If patch PXRM*1.5*12 has not been installed the index will not
 be built.
 
 This patch can be installed independently of the other patches. The 
 documentation describing the new functionality will be available when all
 associated patches are released.

1. Joint Commission for Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)
requires that patients' use of Over-The-Counter (OTC) medications, Herbal
supplements, medications prescribed by Veterans Health Administration 
(VHA) but purchased by the patient at an outside pharmacy, and medications
prescribed by providers outside VHA be documented in patients' medical
records. These four categories of medications will hereafter be referred
to as Non-VA Meds. This patch makes the changes necessary to Inpatient 
Medications V. 5.0 to support Non-VA Meds.
 
2. To accommodate Billing Awareness, it was necessary to modify the 
communication between CPRS and Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 to include 
new diagnosis codes. Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 routes all pharmacy
orders to the appropriate package. This patch makes the changes necessary 
to pass the new diagnosis codes to the appropriate package.

1. Modifications are being made to Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 to no 
longer allow non-standard schedules to be used. This patch provides a 
menu option to allow users to identify non-standard schedules
that are currently in use. This option will search through Order Sets,
Quick Codes, the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1), the PHARMACY 
ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) and all orders for the timeframe specified by
the user. The person running the option will receive a series of email
messages identifying the non-standard schedules. The email message
subjects will be: ADMIN SCHEDULES, ADMIN SCHEDULES NOT IN 51.1,
NON-STANDARD SCHEDULES IN QUICK CODES, NON-STANDARD SCHEDULES IN ORDER
SETS and NON-STANDARD SCHEDULE IN ORDERABLE ITEMS. The search routine can
be run multiple times. This can be used to help show the progress being
made in correcting issues. In addition, the report will show active orders
in the search period. Please note: the default schedules in the PHARMACY 
ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) are for both inpatient and outpatient orders.
 
2. Based on the upcoming requirement from the Joint Commission on 
Accreditation of Hospital Organizations, schedule names that are
considered dangerous will no longer be allowed. This patch provides a 
menu option to allow users to identify schedules that are considered 
dangerous. This option will search through Order Sets, Quick Codes, the 
ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1), the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file 
(#50.7) and all orders for the timeframe specified by the user. The person
running the option will receive a series of email messages identifying the
dangerous schedules. The email message subjects will be: DANGEROUS
SCHEDULES IN 51.1, DANGEROUS SCHEDULES IN ORDERS, DANGEROUS SCHEDULES IN
QUICK CODES, DANGEROUS SCHEDULES IN ORDER SETS and DANGEROUS SCHEDULES IN 
ORDERABLE ITEMS.
 
3. To facilitate the iterative process of running the search and report 
multiple times, two new options are being added to the system. They are 
the Non-Standard Schedule Search [PSJU NSS SEARCH] option and the
Non-Standard Schedule Report [PSJU NSS REPORT] option.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 Phase I of the Inpatient Medications Requirements for the Special Focus
 Group IRA project consists of four patches. The patches are combined in
 host file PSJ_PSS_OR_PSU_110.KID in order to simplify installation at VHA
 facilities. Installation of this host file should be coordinated among
 the four packages affected since only one installation is necessary. The
 patches, in order of install, are:
 
      PSS*1*79   PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT V. 1.0
      PSJ*5*110  INPATIENT MEDICATIONS V. 5.0
      OR*3*213   ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING V. 1.0
      PSU*3*34   PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGEMENT V. 3.0
 
 Patches PSS*1*79, OR*3*213, and PSU*3*34 contain changes to support the
 following enhancements in PSJ*5*110:
 
 1. The Extend Stop Date on Renewal enhancements will allow an order to be
 renewed without creating a new order. Editing of the start date will no
 longer be allowed during the renewal process. In addition, limits have
 been set on the length of time after an order expires that it may be
 renewed. This is outlined in the BCMA 2001 Special Focus Report,
 Requirement #11.
  
 2. The Complex Order enhancements will change the way complex orders are
 handled by linking complex components (child orders) together. If the
 actions Finish, Verify, Discontinue, or Renew are taken on one child
 order, the user will be alerted that the action must be taken on all of
 the complex component orders in the set. The user will then be prompted
 to take the appropriate action on each child order in the complex order
 set. This is outlined in BCMA 2001 Special Focus Report, Requirement #8.
 
 3. The STAT and NOW Order Notification enhancements will alert users
 subscribing to new mail group PSJ STAT NOW PENDING ORDER when a pending
 STAT or NOW order has been received from Computerized Patient Record
 System (CPRS) V. 1.0. Users subscribing to the new mail group PSJ STAT
 NOW ACTIVE ORDER will receive an alert when a STAT or NOW order is made
 active. This is outlined in BCMA 2001 Special Focus Report, Requirement
 #12.
 
 PSJ*5*110 contains repairs for the following defects:
 
 1. A site reported a problem with the non-standard schedule messages that
 display in the order view and during finishing. IV orders with Pro Re
 Nata (PRN) schedules displayed the messages but Unit Dose orders with PRN
 schedules did not. This patch corrects the problem by including the base
 PRN schedule in the non-standard check and making Unit Dose and IV orders
 consistent. NOIS: MIN-1203-40699.
 
 2. A scheduled IV order could be created without a schedule interval when
 created using an IV quick code with a schedule and admin times, but no
 infusion rate. In this scenario, if an infusion rate is then entered
 during the finish process, the order is filed with no schedule interval,
 which is necessary to calculate when doses are due.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. The Inpatient Medication Orders for Outpatients project will allow a
user the ability to order unit dose medications for outpatients. This is
accomplished through modifications to Inpatient Medications V. 5.0,
Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V.1.0 and Scheduling V. 5.3.
This patch provides the changes for Inpatient Medications.
 
2. Provider Comments are not being saved with active IV orders. This patch
corrects this by saving Provider Comments when IV orders become active.
NOIS: ASH-0803-31967, ERI-0303-20187 and ISB-0702-30889. 
 
3. Drug selection lookup was using an old cross reference.  This patch
corrects the program to use the correct one. NOIS: ISB-0803-30450
 
4. To accommodate Billing Awareness, it was necessary to modify the
communication between CPRS and Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 to include
new diagnosis codes. Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 routes all pharmacy
orders to the appropriate package. This patch makes the changes necessary
to pass the new diagnosis codes to the appropriate package.
 
5. A provider entering an order into Computerized Patient Record System
(CPRS) V. 1.0 must be permitted to place a limitation on the duration of
an inpatient medication order. This capability exists for Unit Dose orders
and Inpatient IV orders, but not for IV Fluid orders. This patch makes
the change necessary to receive a duration or dosage limit on an IV Fluid
order placed in CPRS. The limitation will be in hours, days, milliliters,
or liters.
 
6. A site reported a problem with the default start date and time for
orders created between 11pm and midnight. The default start date for these
orders may default to 11pm the following day. This patch corrects the
problem by calculating and displaying the correct default start date and
time. NOIS: BRX-0803-12080.
 
7. Two sites reported a problem with IV labels not printing correctly with
Day-of-Week schedules that had Sunday in the list. This patch corrects
this problem. NOIS: PHO-0903-60884, MIN-1003-41071 and MIN-0204-41197.
 
8. A request was made to modify the Non-Verified/Pending Orders option 
[PSJU VBW] to show the clinic for Outpatient IV orders. This patch makes 
this modification. E3R: 17357
 
9. A description has been added to the ACX cross-reference in the ORDERS
FILE PARENT ORDER field (#125), in the NON-VERIFIED ORDERS file (#53.1) 
at the request of the database administrator.
 
10. A site reported a problem with the display of dosage information 
under certain circumstances. Specifically, there was no  spacing between 
the number and the dosage form. This patch works with changes in Pharmacy 
Data Management V. 1.0 to correct this problem. NOIS: BRX-1004-10173 and 
SFC-1003-62552
 
11. To accomodate the Scheduling Encapsulation project, a change has been
made to the retrieval of appointment information. When a specific error
code is returned, the following message will display in place of the
appointment: "Scheduling database is unavailable". NOIS: ISB-0903-31960
 
12. A site reported that the finishing pharmacist is incorrectly saved as
the provider when the SF - Speed Finish action is used to finish a pending
renewal order. This patch corrects the problem by saving the provider 
that renewed the order with the finished and verified order. 
NOIS: AMA-1004-71742 and CPH-1004-41922
 
13. Orders with Day of Week (DOW) schedules may be created with an 
inappropriate dose frequency which prevents the scheduled doses from 
appearing on the Virtual Due List (VDL) in Bar Code Medication 
Administration (BCMA) V. 3.0. A frequency value appropriate for DOW 
schedules will be stored for orders containing this type of schedule to 
ensure they display correctly in BCMA. NOIS: HIN-0503-41736
 
14. Orders created in CPRS V. 1.0 between 2300 and 2400 may, during the 
finishing process, incorrectly default to a start date and time that is 24
hours later than the correct default start date and time. Orders created 
between 2300 and 2400 will now default to the correct start date and time.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 1. A site reports that when a nurse verifies a renewed order, the nurse's
 initials do not consistently appear in BCMA. This patch corrects the
 problem by saving the verifying nurse information if the nurse 
 verification occurred after the renewal action. NOIS# NCH-1004-40487.
 
 2. A site reports that IV orders copied using the CO (Copy) action in
 Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 retain the original order's verifying 
 pharmacist, so that an unverified copied IV order may incorrectly appear
 to have been verified by a pharmacist. This patch corrects the problem 
 by removing the original order's verifying pharmacist from the copied
 order. NOIS# CLA-1004-22199
 
 3. A site reports that after discontinuing a complex IV order, a user 
 may be prevented from creating a new IV order until first exiting and 
 then returning to the option. The software treats the new IV order like 
 a complex order and prevents entry of some required fields. This patch 
 corrects the problem by improving the check that determines whether or 
 not the current order is a complex order. NOIS# SAG-1004-41795.
 
 4. When using the SF (Speed Finish) action to finish pending renewal
 orders in the Unit Dose Order Entry [PSJU NE] option, the name of the 
 finishing pharmacist is incorrectly saved as the provider for the order.
 This patch corrects this problem by properly saving the ordering provider
 with the order when SF (Speed Finish) is used. NOIS# AMA-1004-71742.
 
 5. When a component, or child order, of a complex order is created from  
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0 with a schedule of NOW 
 and NOW does not exist in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE (#51.1) file, the 
 order does not appear in the patient's profile in Inpatient Medications 
 V. 5.0. This patch corrects the problem by ensuring child orders with a 
 schedule of NOW appear in Inpatient Medications V. 5.0.
 
 6. Renewed Unit Dose orders do not appear on the updated pick list
 printed using the Update Pick List [PSJU PLUP] option. With this patch
 renewed orders will appear on the updated pick list when appropriate.
 NOIS: NCH-1104-40147
 
 7. When finishing a complex order that was renewed from CPRS, there is a
 prompt for Pre-Exchange Doses, but there is no prompt to print the
 Pre-Exchange Report. A prompt has been added to allow the Pre-Exchange
 report to be printed for renewed complex orders. NOIS: MAR-1004-21942.
 
 8. The SF Speed Finish action in the Unit Dose Order Entry [PSJU NE]
 option prompts for Pre-Exchange Doses, but there is no prompt to print
 the Pre-Exchange Report when finishing a pending renewal order. A prompt
 has been added to allow the Pre-Exchange Report to be printed for orders
 that are finished using the SF Speed Finish action. NOIS: CLE-1004-42151.
 
 9. The initial label printed for renewed continuous IV orders indicates
 it is due at the date and time that the order was renewed, rather than
 at the next scheduled infusion date and time. With this patch, the first
 label printed for this type of order will be due at the next scheduled
 infusion date and time. IND-1104-40485.
 
 10. After finishing IV scripts, the user is prompted for the number of
 labels to print.  The label print code does not limit the user input, so
 if the user enters an excessive number of labels, then this can lead to
 system performance problems.  This patch will apply the limit of 99
 labels at the number of labels prompt. SFC-0603-61734.
 
 11. Complex Orders are not showing on the VDL in BCMA when the order
 initially contains a schedule without a frequency, regardless of edits
 made during finishing. With this patch, the schedule changes made during
 finish will update the complex orders schedule frequency, enabling the
 orders to display in BCMA at the appropriate times. SBY-1104-31772
 
 12. The stop date of a pending renewal order containing a non-standard
 schedule and an orderable item with a day/dose limit cannot be edited
 until after the order is made active. Also, Schedule Type and Unit
 Per Dose edits made during finish of a pending renewal are not applied
 when the order is made active. With this patch, changes made to these
 fields during the finish proces will be applied to the active order.
 ERI-1204-20679
 
 13. One-time orders that are not part of a complex order may be renewed
 from CPRS V.1.0, even after they are given. This patch will prevent this
 problem by preventing all non-complex one-time orders from being renewed.
 Restriction of the renewal of complex one-time orders will be addressed
 in a future CPRS V.1.0 patch. PSI-04-056.
 
 14. This patch modifies the Data Dictionary of the NON-VERIFIED ORDERS
 FILE (#53.1) for the ORDERS FILE PARENT ORDER field (#125). The change
 removes Inpatient Medications from the process of stripping NOW orders
 from Complex Orders. This process is handled exclusively by CPRS.
 
 53.1,125     ORDERS FILE PARENT ORDER .2;8 POINTER TO ORDER FILE (#100)
 
 
 
              LAST EDITED:     DEC 13, 2004

              DESCRIPTION:     This is the parent of a CPRS order that
                               may have a parent/child relationship in
                               CPRS.

                               This cross reference is created each time a
                               component of a complex order, or child
                               order, is received from CPRS.  This cross
                                reference will not be created for orders
                               with a schedule of NOW, effectively
                               disassociating the NOW order from the other
                               child orders in the complex order.

1. A request has been made to allow sites to define inpatient orders for 
outpatients' behavior on a clinic-by-clinic basis. The two changes would 
add the ability to control auto-dc of orders and whether or not they
appear in the Bar Code Medication Administration V. 3.0 package. This
patch helps to accomplish this goal by doing the following:
 
a. Rename the CLINIC STOP DATES file (#53.46) to be the CLINIC DEFINITION 
   file (#53.46).
b. Add the AUTO-DC IMO ORDERS field (#2) and the SEND TO BCMA? field (#3) 
   to the CLINIC DEFINITION file (#53.46).
c. Remove the Clinic Stop Dates option [PSJ CSD].
d. Add the Clinic Definition option [PSJ CD].
 
2. A problem was reported with inpatient orders for outpatients 
displaying in the incorrect display group on the Orders tab in the 
Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0. This patch corrects this
problem by modifying the HL7 messaging as well as the order editing 
process to correctly define the appointment date and time for the
inpatient order.
 
3. It was discovered during internal review that the STAT NOW MAIL GROUP 
field (#5) of the INPATIENT WARD PARAMETERS file (#59.6) had been omitted 
from the appropriate distribution. This patch corrects this problem by 
exporting the field.
 
4. A problem was identified with the display order on the meds tab in 
CPRS. The problem was related to information being passed from Inpatient 
Medications V. 5.0 to identify inpatient orders for outpatients. This 
patch corrects this problem by modifying the data pass to CPRS.

 PSI-04-061: Expected First Dose
 -------------------------------
 During order entry in CPRS the provider is presented with the "Expected 
 First Dose" for the order.  The Pharmacist's have requested that the 
 "Expected First Dose" be displayed in Backdoor pharmacy when Start Date, 
 Stop Date and Admin Times are entered or edited.
 
 This change will require the "Expected First Dose" to be displayed after 
 the Stop Date is entered in New or Renewed orders as well as when the 
 Start Date, Stop Date and/or Admin Times fields are edited.  During the 
 edit process it is possible to edit one or all of these fields in any 
 order.  This could cause the "Expected First Dose" to be displayed 
 multiple times.  This will be handled by determining the last field
 that was edited and displaying the "Expected first dose" only after that
 field.
 
 
 PSI-04-071: Provider Comments Display

 renewals orders. The error occurred after an unsuccessful lock of the
 original renewed order. This patch will prevent this error by ensuring a 
 graceful exit when a lock is not successful. CLE-1204-41459
 
 2. The administration schedule validation process causes an error if a 
 day-of-week PRN schedule is used that contains days that are out of 
 order, for example, "WE-MO PRN". This patch will prevent this error and 
 make the validation of this type of schedule consistent with non-PRN
 day-of-week schedules.
 
 3. An undefined error may occur when viewing a pending IV renewal order
 from the Medications Tab in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V.
 1.0. This patch will correct the problem by preventing the error from
 occurring. MIN-1204-41611.
 
 4. When renewing an Inpatient IV order from the Inpatient Order Entry
 [PSJ OE] option, an edit to the Provider is not reflected in the order
 when viewed from CPRS V.1.0. This patch will correct the problem by
 ensuring the updated provider information is transmitted to CPRS V.1.0.
 IND-0105-40153.
 
 5. There is no prompt for output device for the PRE-EXCHANGE UNITS REPORT
 after copying a Unit Dose order using the CO Copy action in Inpatient
 Order Entry [PSJ OE] option. This patch will add a device prompt for the
 Pre-Exchange Units Report to the Unit Dose copy action. HWH-1204-41654.
 
 6. When finishing a pending unit dose renewal order, the default 
 administration times associated with the administration schedule will 
 always default into the order, overwriting the order's existing
 administration time. With this patch, renewal orders will retain the
 original order's administration times. BHS-0105-10562.
 
 7. When the schedule type is edited during the finish of a unit dose
 order that was renewed from CPRS V.1.0, the order appears twice in the
 Patient Profile (Unit Dose) [PSJU PR] option. This patch corrects the
 problem by removing the display associated with the previous schedule
 type before adding the display associated with the new schedule type.
 FRE-0105-60387, MAC-0205-61020.
 
 8. Multiple identically named schedules in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE
 file (#51.1) may cause an invalid schedule warning message to appear
 inappropriately. This patch corrects the problem by preventing the
 invalid warning message from appearing if the schedule name is defined in
 the file, even if duplicates are present. HD0000000085881.
 
 9. A non-standard Day of Week schedule entered without administration
 times using the schedule builder in CPRS V. 3.0 may default to a
 different schedule in Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 if the non-standard
 schedule is a partial match to a unique Day of Week schedule in the
 ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1). For example, if the non-standard
 schedule SU-MO-TU-WE is entered without admin times using the CPRS V.
 3.0 schedule builder, and the schedule SU-MO-TU-WE-TH@09 exists in the
 ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1), and there are no other schedules in
 the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) that begin with SU-MO-TU-WE, the
 order's schedule will default to SU-MO-TU-WE-TH@09 when the order is
 selected for finishing.  HD0000000087120, PSI-05-025.
 
 10. A non-standard Day of Week schedule entered using the schedule
 builder in CPRS V. 3.0 defaults to the wrong Expected First Dose if the
 schedule is a partial match to exactly one schedule in the ADMINISTRATION
 SCHEDULE file (#51.1), and that schedule that was found contains an
 administration time. HD0000000087028 PSI-05-026.

 HD0000000086717 - Multiple active Orders Appearing in BCBU
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 A problem has been identified that will cause the BCBU to contain
 multiple active orders for the same order.  This issue happens in the
 PSJ OE (Inpatient Medications) option.  After a pharmacist finishes and
 accepts a complex order, then edits and verifies each order in sequence,
 multiple HL7 records are sent to the BCBU signifying the order has been
 verified.  The BCBU should only receive 1 record signifying the order is
 verified.  This patch will modify this behavior by sending the HL7   
 records as "Pending" until all child orders are verified.  Then a final 
 HL7 transaction will be sent telling the BCBU that the entire order has 
 been verified.

The "undefined variable DIFLD(1)" error is being caused by the
recursive use of the ^DIE call in a FileMan cross reference.
The "DATE OF DEATH" field of the "PATIENT" file triggers many
cross reference procedures and routines.
    
The purpose of this patch is to make changes to the Inpatient
Medications routines associated with the "DATE OF DEATH" APSJD
cross reference.  There are six tag/program locations that
use the ^DIE call when this cross reference is triggered.
    
This patch changes the routines so that they use the

 it is possible to enter the same stop date as the original for

 1. When a pick list contains one or more orders for which there is 
 an inconsistency between the number of dispense drugs associated with 
 the order and the number of dispense drug index entries associated with 
 the order, a MailMan message is generated incorrectly stating that a 
 problem exists with a DRUG file (#50) entry. A message generated in 
 this way may be identified by the display of numbers separated by
 commas, rather than the name of the drug.
 
 Example:
     The following items from your DRUG file were found to have NO DATA in
     their PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field:
          1234567,123,1
 
       Any PICK LIST with any of these items will NOT be completely FILED
     AWAY until the PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field has been entered into 
     for these items.
       Even if there is no cost for these items, a zero (0) must be 
     entered into the PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field so the package knows
     it is not an error or an omission.  UNTIL THIS IS DONE, NO COST
     REPORT WILL BE ACCURATE, AND ANY PICK LIST WITH THESE ITEMS CANNOT BE
     PURGED.
 
 With this patch, this MailMan message will not be generated due to an
 extraneous or 'orphan' dispense drug index entry associated with an
 order. HD0000000068561. 
 
 2. To assist in preventing problems with dispense drugs of active

changed (editing field 12 backdoor), and one of the drugs' units 
dispensed becomes 0, backdoor pharmacy will still display a value of 1

    that is standard with other packages.  This patch will correct this by
    replacing the lookup call to ^DIC with the DPTLK API designed for
    patient lookup.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
A provider entered a medication through CPRS with the intent of the order 
being administered on a QD0600 continuous schedule.  The medication 
ordered, however, had a default schedule type of PRN.  Therefore, when 
the pharmacist finished the order backdoor, the default schedule type of 
PRN overrode the Provider's intent of a continuous schedule.  Because the 
medication was finished as PRN, the patient missed a dose of the 
medication.
 
This patch addresses this issue by only allowing the backdoor default
schedule type to override the incoming CPRS schedule type if the backdoor
default is "Fill on Request".

    is Inactive, but does not check the "USED IN IV FLUID ORDER ENTRY" 
    field to determine if the additive should be used.
 
    This patch will change the software to add a check of the "USED 
    IN IV FLUID ORDER ENTRY" field and exclude the additive from selection
    based on that field.
 
*** The software included in this patch is designed to exclude an IV
    Additive from the selection process only if the "USED IN IV FLUID

when prompted, the order was finished so that the BCMA Message Box flag 
was set.  Therefore, when the medication was to be administered in BCMA, 
a pop-up box was to display to show the nurse the Special Instructions.  
The order was renewed via CPRS, and the order was FINISHED backdoor and 
then had the Special Instructions were deleted before accepting the order 
and verifying.  When the nurse entered BCMA to administer the medication 
on the renewed order, BCMA behaved as though the medication was given, 
but no pop-up box appeared, and the medication was not marked as given on 
the VDL.  The underlying issue was that while the order had the Special 
Instructions deleted, the flag to display/not display the message box in 
BCMA was not cleared.

HD000000104291 - Stop Date calculation can be in the Past
------------------------------------------------------------------------
When editing the Additive or Solution of an active order that was 
previously renewed, the stop date/time can be re-calculated in the Past. 
This will cause the order to be expired immediately upon verification.  
The solution to this issue is to modify the Stop Date/Time calculation to 
use the "Last Renewed" date as a starting point, instead of the 
"Original" Start Date/Time of the order, when editing the Additive or 
Solution of an active IV order that has been previously renewed. (this 
makes the Stop Date/Time calculation that occurs during edits to the 
Additives and Solutions fields consistent with edits to other fields).
 
During the Testing of the solution above a new issue has been found.
 
New Issue 1: Editing the Additive or Solution for non-renewed orders
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the same issue as the Original issue but it can also apply to a 
Non-renewed Active order.
 
The solution for the New issue is to Modify the Inpatient Meds IV Order 
Check logic to Display the warning message "The Stop Date/Time is in the 
Past.  This order will automatically expire upon verification", anytime 
the stop date calculation returns a Stop Date/Time in the past.  The 
Pharmacist will then be asked if they still wish to continue.  If they 
continue, the order will automatically expire immediately upon 
verification  If they select to not continue, they may go back to the 
profile and edit the Stop Date/Time.

** WARNING - After installing this patch, a location AND ad appointment

This patch addresses the issue of an inpatient's medication's stop time 
being inadvertently set to 24 hours.
 
A medical student at a site erroneously changed the location of an 
inpatient while ordering a unit dose medication in CPRS.  The clinic 
location the student chose had a default stop time on orders of 24 
hours.  When the pharmacist finished the order, it was not noticed that 
the stop date was 24 hours, not the normal default stop date for an 
inpatient's medication orders.  As a result, the patient did not receive 
his/her medication as prescribed.  The inpatient meds code in VistA 
assumed the order was an IMO (Inpatient Medications for Outpatients) 
order because it had a clinic location.  The code will be updated to 
recognize a unit dose.

A site reported a problem with the fact that medication route did not
appear on the IV label. This patch corrects this problem by adding the
medication route to the IV label. PSI-05-107, HD115653
 
****Important Note****
The decision of the workgroup was that the medication route should appear
in a larger font than the remaining text. If you do not define the
following correctly, the medication route will not be in a larger font.
In order to allow this functionality, four new control codes must be set
up. They are:
 
SM          Start Med Route
EM          End Med Route
SMF         Start Med Route field
EMF         End Med Route field
 
These control codes are defined by using FileMan V. 22.0 and editing the
CONTROL CODES multiple (#3.2055) of the TERMINAL TYPE file (#3.2).
 
Each printer can have different values required in order to properly
print the route. Please note that it may be necessary to adjust the 
label length through the SITE PARAMETERS (IV) option in order for the 
label to print correctly.
 
The following is one example of the setup for a Zebra 105SL printer.

1. During testing of Remote Data Interoperability (RDI), a problem was 
discovered with the order checks involving remote allergies. Not all of 
the remote allergies were being included when doing order checks using VA 
Drug Class. This patch corrects this problem.
 
2. An issue with too many false positive order checks was discovered when 
doing order checks on certain drug classes. Analgesics, as a class, were 
performing order checks across all members. For example: class CN101 was 
generating an order check for class CN102. This patch corrects this 
problem by ensuring that Analgesic order checks only match against the 
specific class: CN101 to CN101. HD0000000161499
 
3. One feature of RDI is the notification to the user when processing 
orders that only local data is being used - if the remote data is 
unavailable. Several sites reported issues with this mechanism. This 
patch corrects this problem by performing the check for remote data 
availability upon entering the patient's chart, rather than on each order.
 
4. The list of remote allergies has been added to Patient Information 
screen. If a patient has the same allergy information from several remote
sites, it will only be listed once.

This patch will correct three problems with the Action Profile reports 
from three Remedy tickets, HD118347 HD120274, and HD68707, as well as one 
undefined variable error with the Patient Profile, [PSJU PR], in ticket 
HD120176.
 
The first Action Profile Report problem was a result of internal testing 
with patch PSJ*5*157, wherein it was noted that if a device used for 
printing did not have a standard page length, the number of lines printed 
in the Additional Medication Orders section of the Action Profile reports 
[PSJU AP-1] and [PSJU AP-2] would vary from patient to patient.  It was 
decided by the Inpatient Medications Workgroup that the number of lines 
printed for this section should be standardized to 10 lines.
 
The second problem occurs only with the Action Profile 2 report, [PSJU 
AP-2].  The problem only occurs if the report is printed to the screen.  
The report prints properly if printed to a printer.  If the patient has a 
verified allergy, a verified adverse reaction, or one of each, the 
Allergy and Adverse Reaction section of the report is printing "No 
Allergy Assessment".  This patch will correct this problem so the AP-2 
report is consistent with the AP-1 report, and shows the correct allergy 
and adverse reaction information for the patient.
 
The third Action Profile Report issue was logged because one-time orders 
are appearing on the Action Profile-1 [PSJU AP-1]  and Action Profile-2 
[PSJU AP-2] reports with the option available to the provider to RENEW 
the orders.  The ability to renew one-time orders was removed due to a 
patient safety issue.  Having the renew option available to the provider 
could lead to a reoccurrence of the patient safety issue.
 
The Undefined Variable Error occurs with the Patient Profile, [PSJU PR].  
When attempting to filter the profile at any WARD prompt, if the user 
presses ENTER or the up-carat (^), instead of being taken to the previous 
filter choices or the main menu, the user is taken to a prompt to filter 
by Room/Bed or Patient.  If the user again presses ENTER or ^, an 
undefined variable error occurs.

This patch addresses one Patient Safety Issue contained in one Remedy 
ticket.
 
PSI 06 066
This addresses Remedy ticket HD146661.
 
The site reported an issue that if they used a leading zero for the 
limit/duration of an IV, in this case 0.5L, the stop date calculated for 
the order was 6 minutes after the start date/time.  CPRS has addressed 
this on their end with patch OR*3*254.  Because of the CPRS fix, 
Inpatient Meds should never receive an invalid duration/limit from CPRS.  
However, it was discussed with the Inpatient Meds workgroup, and they 
agreed that Inpatient Meds should make a contingency plan fix just in 
case some future CPRS project removes the fixes in place from OR*3*254.  
As a result, Inpatient Meds will now be able to handle an invalid 
duration/limit should one ever be received from CPRS.
 
The fix agreed upon by the Inpatient Meds workgroup will do three 
things.  First, it will NOT allow the pharmacist to FINISH the order.  
Second, the duration/limit field displayed to the pharmacist will read 
*INVALID DURATION/LIMIT*.  Third, the Stop Date for the order will read 
"CANNOT CALCULATE".
 
OR*3*254 is an independent CPRS patch, and is not required for this 
Inpatient Meds patch.

1. A site reported a problem with the new duration field that was added to
CPRS GUI v25. In response to a patient safety issue, this field was added 
to the IV Fluid order dialog. In addition, Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 
was modified to always have the duration field be used for the stop date 
calculation. This has caused problems in sites where they have policies 
that say certain medications can only be written for a certain period of 
time. This patch corrects this problem by modifying Inpatient Medications 
V. 5.0 to consider the duration the same way as all other stop date 
parameters, rather than as an override.
 
In order to assist in communications with the provider, an alert will be 
sent to the ordering provider whenever the duration they entered is not 
used to calculate the stop date of the order. HD0000000111592

2. After the installation of PSJ*5.0*111 and PSJ*5.0*131, the formatting 
on the MAR reports was adversely affected. Sites reported pagination was 
off, pages displayed too much empty space, and the signature block no 
longer appeared at the bottom of each page.
 
Code modifications have been made in the MAR routines to correct the 
formatting problems. Page numbering has been corrected.  The signature 
block prints at the end of each page. Pending orders, non-clinic and 
clinic orders will display in the correct location on
the MAR report. Orders with a stop date/time greater than or equal to the 
selected 24 Hour MAR start date/time will print out correctly. HD94303,

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1. A site reported a problem with the medication route being blank on the
Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) V. 3.0 Virtual Due List. During
investigation of possible corrections for this, it was determined that
another issue needed to be addressed with how to determine when to prompt
for an injection site.
 
This patch assists to correct these problems by adding two new items to 
the Application Programming Interface (API) from Inpatient Medications V. 
5.0 to BCMA. The NAME field (.01) as well as the PROMPT FOR INJ. SITE IN 
BCMA field (#8) from the MEDICATION ROUTE file (#51.2) will now be sent in
the API. HD0000000166204, HD0000000164890, PSI-06-152, PSI-06-158
 
2. In support of the BCMA V. 3.0 project BCMA HSC-III, two changes are 
required to the APIs that supply information to BCMA. First, the flag 
information for both Unit Dose and IV orders has been added to both the 
summary and detail APIs. Second, an indicator has been added that will 
tell BCMA that this order would have triggered a notification to the 
STAT/NOW mail group.
 
3. During testing of the BCMA V. 3.0 project BCMA HSC-III, a problem was 
discovered with the API that determines if an order should trigger a 
notification to the STAT/NOW mail group. If the parameter which controls 
the trigger was not defined, all orders would be flagged. This patch 
corrects this problem. However, it is important to note that if the 
parameter PRIORITIES FOR ACTIVE NOTIFY is not defined, no order will be 
flagged as stat for the purposes of BCMA.

This patch will provide a temporary fix as detailed in Patient safety 
issue PSI-07-075 for BCMA.  
 
When using the CPRS Med Order Button (MOB), it was discovered that certain
hardware configurations allow a "virtual" IP address.  This causes a
single user to be logged into two physical nodes simultaneously.  When
this happens, the order placed in CPRS MOB cannot be filed.  The user
receives an error box which states "Missing data, unable to file."  The
order does not show up on the VDL. It was determined that there is risk of
duplication when the order does not file.
 
This patch will modify the error message to make it more noticeable and 
robust.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Current functionality concerning the duplicate order checks displays all
duplicate drug and duplicate drug class orders found, but does not allow
the user to select these for discontinuation. If the user wishes to
discontinue any of the presented duplicates, they must wait until after
they are done with the current order process in which the duplicate order
checks presented their results. The major functionality change to the
Inpatient Medications software will consist of allowing users to select
for discontinuation any duplicate Inpatient orders found, at the time
these duplicates are presented by the duplicate order checks.  In
addition, all duplicate Outpatient orders found, are grouped together and
displayed prior to all other order check results and will be used for
information purposes only. The current process will be modified so that
when a duplicate order check is performed, the duplicate Inpatient orders
are displayed in a numbered list. The user will then be prompted to select
which, if any, of the listed duplicate orders should be discontinued. The
user may choose to select none, thus leaving all orders intact. The 
results from both duplicate order checks, Duplicate Drug and Duplicate
Drug Class, will be presented together. Duplicate order checks occur at
several points in the ordering process, including, when entering a new
medication order, when renewing an existing medication order, when
finishing an order, and when editing an order's drug.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
A site reported a problem with renewed pending orders.  The
Pharmacist's User Manual states:
"When the SAME STOP DATE ON ALL ORDERS parameter is set to
yes, the module will assign a default stop date for each patient. This
date is initially set when the first order is entered for the patient. A
new default stop date is assigned for the patient when an order is
renewed and the order's stop date plus three days is greater than the
current default stop date. This date is shown as the default value for
the stop date of each order entered for the patient. However, if a day or
dose limit exists for the selected Orderable Item, and the limit is less
than the default stop date, the earlier stop date and time will be
displayed."
 
The way the screen defaults in pharmacy for finishing would lead the
pharmacist to finish the new order prior to finishing the renewals.
This creates the potential for medication orders to default to an
"incorrect" stop date/time. This problem caused a patient to completely
miss receiving a newly ordered medication, as the new order expired prior
to the first scheduled dose time.
 
The following example shows the way the screen displays the orders from
the PENDING/NON-VERIFIED option:
 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - A C T I V E - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
   1    MULTIVITAMINS TAB                   C  04/01  04/08  R

          Give: 1 TABLET PO QAM (07)
 
 
 
This patch corrects the problem by reversing the order in which the
PENDING and PENDING RENEWALS are displayed.  With the entries reversed
the user will finish the PENDING RENEWAL order first, followed by the
PENDING order, and the correct stop date/time will be displayed.

BCMA by storing the most recent text in an additional location. The 
comment will still be stored in the current location. It will also be in 
the MOST RECEMT FLAG COMMENT field (#129) of the NON-VERIFIED/PENDING file
(#53.1) which is exported in this patch. For active unit dose orders, it
will be stored in the MOST RECENT FLAG COMMENT field (#128) of the UNIT

When an order from CPRS is processed in the Inpatient Medications
application the Comments field is automatically checked to verify that it

these spaces.  When this happens, a Change Action is generated in CPRS.
This Change Action will cause CPRS to recalculate the Instructions. In
some cases, the recalculation of the Instructions will result in the
strength being added to the instuctions. This may result in the patient
receiving an incorrect dose.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch contains changes in support of Computerized Patient
Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0 GUI v27 release.
 
1.  MEDICATION ROUTE CHANGES
----------------------------
- Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 will use the medication route received from
  CPRS V. 1.0 as the default when finishing an IV order entered via CPRS
  V. 1.0. For new orders entered via Inpatient Medications V. 5.0, if all
  of the orderable items associated with an order contain the same default
  medication route, that route will be used as the default. If there are
  any differences, there will be no default medication route.
 
- Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 will send to BCMA V. 3.0 the full
  medication route name for display on the Virtual Due List (VDL).
 
2.  INFUSION RATE CHANGES
-------------------------
- Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 now accepts infusion rate from CPRS in both
  ml/hour and as 'infuse over time'.
 
- In the order view screen for an order with an intermittent IV type, the
  infusion rate now displays as "Infuse Over" followed by the time. For
  example, "Infuse Over 30 minutes".
 
  The infusion rate for an intermittent IV order can be null.
 
3.  IV TYPE CHANGES
-------------------
- Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 shall accept an IV type of "I"
  (Intermittent) or "C" (Continuous) from CPRS V. 1.0.  When an IV type of
  CONTINUOUS is received, Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 defaults to an IV
  type of Admixture.  When IV type of INTERMITTENT is received, 
  Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 defaults to an IV type of Piggyback.
  Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 sends to CPRS V. 1.0 updates to an order's
  IV type.
 
- Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 now accepts schedule information from
  CPRS V. 1.0 for intermittent IV orders entered via the IV Fluid
  Ordering Dialog.  Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 also sends to
  CPRS V. 1.0 any schedule changes for intermittent IV orders.
 
- A new field, IV TYPE CATEGORY (#128) is being added to the NON-
  VERIFIED ORDERS file (#53.1).  The IV TYPE CATEGORY will be "C"
  (Continuous) for orders with an IV TYPE of Admixture, Hyperal,
  Non-Intermittent Syringe, or Chemotherapy with a CHEMOTHERAPY TYPE
  of Admixture, Hyperal, or Non-Intermittent Syringe.  The IV TYPE
  CATEGORY will be "I" (Intermittent) for orders with an IV TYPE of
  Piggyback, Intermittent Syringe, or Chemotherapy with a CHEMOTHERAPY
  TYPE of Piggyback or Intermittent Syringe.
 
4.  RENEWED ORDER CHANGES
-------------------------
- When discontinuing pending renewal orders, Inpatient Medications V. 5.0
  will provide the user an option to discontinue the pending renewal
  order and/or the original orders.  The pharmacist shall be given the
  option to discontinue the pending order, both orders, or exit the
  discontinue function.
 
5.  REMOVE CALLS TO OBSOLETE ROUTINE
------------------------------------
- At the request of CPRS V. 1.0, active calls to obsolete routine OR3CONV
  have been removed from Inpatient Medications V. 5.0. 
 
6.  EXPECTED FIRST DOSE FOR ONE-TIME ORDERS (HD 98365)
------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
   During testing of the CPRS V. 1.0 GUI v26 release, sites reported a
   problem with an incorrect display of expected first dose for orders
   with a schedule type of "ONE TIME".
Resolution:
   If the schedule type is "ONE TIME", do not display an Expected
   First Dose for the order.
 
7.  CORRECT ABBREVIATION OF MILLIMOLE (HD 145562)
-------------------------------------------
Problem:
   The correct abbreviation for the word MILLIMOLE, which is MMOL
   is not available in the system.
Resolution:
   The abbreviation for Millimole, "MMOL", will be included in
   this patch.

This patch corrects the typographical error in 2 routines within

infusion rate is less than 10ml/hr
 
This patch addresses the following Remedy ticket(s):
------------------------------------------------------------------
HD219677        (Original)      Potential typographical error.
HD234014        (Original)      IV ADMIX rate under 10ml/hr calculates 
                        bags wrong
 
Overview of Remedy ticket(s):
------------------------------------------------------------------
HD219677:
There is typographical error in line tag ENHEAD+21^PSJHEAD and 
H1+15^PSGCAPP0  that should be a plus sign instead of underscore.
 
HD234014:
When an IV Admixture has a rate of less than 10ml/hr the calculation of 
bags needed till the next scheduled IV batch run is inaccurate.
 
Problem (219677)
------------------------------------------------------------------
There is typographical error in line tag ENHEAD+21^PSJHEAD and 
H1+15^PSGCAPP0.  It should be a plus sign instead of underscore
 
Resolution (219677)
This does appear to be a typographical error, it would never result in a 
functional defect. EN+3^PSJHEAD and H1+15^PSGCAPP0 is modified to replace 
the underscore ("_") with a plus sign ("+").  
 
Problem (234014)
------------------------------------------------------------------
If the infusion rate is less than 10ml/hr the number of IV bags needed is 
calculated incorrectly.
 
 
Resolution (234014)
The pattern match for infusion rate in line tag EN+3^PSIVORE is looking 
for at least 1 digit, with a period as optional and at least 1 digit 
after the period. This only works if the infusion rate is 2 digit or 
more.  The pattern match in EN+3^PSIVORE is modified to make the digit 
after the period as optional so the pattern match can also be used when 
the infusion rate is a single digit.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch resolves two issues in the Inpatient Medications package.

1. When stat medications are ordered using Inpatient Medications for
Outpatients (IMO), the resulting notification email lacked the
name of the clinic. Ward names were included correctly. Clinic names
were added. The mail group receiving the notification is PSJ STAT NOW
ACTIVE or PSJ STAT NOW PENDING.
 
The routines PSJHL4 and PSJHL4A were modified to establish a value for CLINIC
if the location is a clinic, and then set using the same variable as ward.
 
2. After the release of Patch PSJ*5*110, MAR labels do include the
order/renewal date on the left side of the label, which is attached
to the MAR. It only appears on the right side, which is discarded.
The date has been placed on left side as well as the right side.

Routine PSGLOI was modified to correct this problem. If the order is not
pending, the order/renewal date is set at the left hand side of the label.

Description:
===========
 
This patch contains four Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 fixes that sites
logged during the compliance date period for the CPRS (Computerized 
Patient Record System) GUI v27 release.
 
 
1. The first issue, Remedy Ticket HD280022, pertains to Day of Week
schedules entered for IV Piggyback orders via the CPRS IV Fluids Dialog.
If the user creates a schedule using the schedule builder, and uses the
new format of Day of Week@Schedule (example: MO-WE-FR@BID), and if the
root schedule (MO-WE-FR) exists in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE File 
(#51.1), when the order is viewed in backdoor pharmacy, the
administration time(s) for the order will be null.
 
Problem:
--------
Admin times are null if a Day of Week schedule created via the schedule
builder in CPRS exists in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE File (#51.1).
 
Resolution:
-----------
In PSGS0, do not QUIT before the admin times are set if the schedule
is a Day of Week schedule, even if it exists in the schedule file.
 
 
2. The second issue, Remedy Ticket HD246438 and its duplicates, is also 
logged as Patient Safety Issue PSI-08-068,PSPO #782.  This is an issue
with an invalid frequency for IV Piggyback orders.  This issue has existed
prior to the release of CPRS GUI v27, but the sites are reporting an
increase in the occurrence of the problem after the install of CPRS GUI 
v27. For unknown reasons, the frequency of some IV Piggyback orders is 
null when it should contain a value.
 
No site or developer has been able to 
reproduce this issue at-will, and there does not appear to be any
pattern to the processes or procedures that precede the occurrence of this
problem. With this patch, if the frequency for an IV Piggyback order is
null, and it should contain a value, the code will attempt to directly
set an appropriate frequency into the PHARMACY PATIENT File (#55) upon
verification of the order, and upon the order becoming active.
 
Problem:
--------
The frequency is being set to null very sporadically for IV Piggyback
orders.  No root cause is known.
 
Resolution:
-----------
During the verification process, if the IV is intermittent, and the
frequency is null, attempt to re-set the frequency based on the name
of the schedule as well as other variables that should
contain the value of the frequency.  These changes are in routine 
PSIVORFB.
 
3. The third issue, Remedy Ticket HD274682 and its duplicates, is an
undefined variable error in the new Meds Tab sort for CPRS.  The root
cause of the problem is that a pointer to the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM File
(#50.7) is missing in either the NON-VERIFIED ORDERS File (#53.1) or the
PHARMACY PATIENT File (#55).  Because the pointer does not exist, when
a temporary global is being built to display the orders for the patient, 
an undefined variable error occurs.
 
 
Problem:
--------
Very old orders exist in the system that do not contain a pointer to
the orderable item.  When the new Meds Tab sort routines attempt to
use the pointer value as a subscript in a ^TMP global setting, and the
pointer's value is null, a null subscript error occurs.  This causes
a hard error in CPRS and shuts CPRS down.
 
Resolution:
-----------
If the pointer to the orderable item does not exist, the routines will
use the phrase "Orderable Item Not Found" as the subscript value in place
of what should be the name of the orderable item.  This allows the Meds
Tab sort routines to process without error, and the patient's medications
appear without problems on the CPRS Meds tab.  The updated routines are
PSJORRO, PSJORRN, and PSJORRN1.
 
4. The fourth issue addressed by this patch is Remedy Ticket HD280040, 
which deals with an inconsistency between CPRS and backdoor pharmacy
with respect to continuous IV orders. 
 
If the IV order originates from CPRS, a
fractional infusion rate of &lt; 1 ml/hr (0.9 ml/hr for example), backdoor
pharmacy allows the infusion rate, and the order can be finished and
verified without issue.  However, if the order originates from backdoor
pharmacy, a fractional infusion rate &lt; 1 ml/hr is not accepted, and the
user is presented a message "Invalid Infusion Rate", and they cannot
finish and verify the order.  This patch will make backdoor pharmacy
behave consistently with CPRS.
 
Problem:
--------
If an order is entered via backdoor pharmacy for a continuous IV, and the
order is created with a fractional infusion rate of &lt; 1 ml/hr, the system
presents the user with the error message, "Your infusion rate is in an
invalid format", and the order cannot be completed.
 
Resolution:
-----------
If the order has a fractional infusion rate &lt; 1 ml/hr, the order must
contain a leading zero, and the system will view the infusion rate as
valid.  (example - infusion rate must be 0.9 ml/hr to be valid)
The coding will affect routines PSIVSP, PSIVCHK, and PSIVORE.

This patch contains a partial resolution for Patient Safety Issue
PSI 07-073, PSPO #526, and is outlined in Remedy Ticket HD67749.
Another portion of this PSI is being addressed by the Vista
Maintenance Team in a separate patch, PSJ*5.0*216.
 
Problem:
--------
If the pharmacist must edit the dispense drug(s) for an active
Unit Dose order, there is currently no entry made in the
Activity Log for the order that reflects this change.  Medication
errors have happened due to edited dispense drugs, and there is
currently no audit trail to help track the information.
 
Resolution:
-----------
This enhancement will compare the original dispense drug(s) for
the order with the edited value for the dispense drug(s).  If
there is a difference between the values, the modified code in
routine PSGOE92 will call the routine that logs entries into the
Activity Log for the order.
 
The structure for the activity log entry will be:
DATE^DUZ^6000^FIELD^OLD
 
DATE  =  Timestamp date/time of the edit.
DUZ   =  The system DUZ of the person making the edit.
6000  =  A code denoting that a field was edited.
FIELD =  The name of the field that was edited.
OLD   =  Old data before the field was edited.  This contains the
         dispense drug IEN, dispense drug name, and units per dose.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 HD0000000139263 involves multiple additives with values in the MESSAGE 
 field (#14) of the IV ADDITIVES file (#52.6).  When an IV label 
 prints, and the IV order contains multiple additives, if more than one 
 additive has a MESSAGE field value, only the message of the first 
 additive in the IV order will display on the label.  
  
 HD0000000139800 The CPRS Unit Dose report shows the status of the unit 
 dose orders for a given patient.  If an order has the status 
 "Discontinued due to Edit", nothing is displaying in the CPRS Unit 
 Dose report's status field.  The problem is due to Inpatient Meds not 
 sending CPRS the complete information for the status if the order was 
 discontinued due to edit.
  
 HD0000000159948 Within Parameters Edit Menu [PSJ PARAM EDIT MENU], the 
 option Clinic Definition [PSJ CD] asks the user for a CLINIC GROUP 
 NAME.  This prompt is in error and the option should end if no new 
 clinic is chosen for edit.   This issue has no negative impact on the 
 patient but is an inconvenience to the user of the option.
  
 HD0000000168525 When exiting the option by typing an "^" up-arrow at the 
 Report/Label device prompt in Site Parameters (IV) [PSJI SITE PARAMETERS]
 option, the system will default "TELNET" into the field even though a 
 value already exists. The software should retain the existing 
 report/label device at this prompt and not change the default device.  
 This issue has caused the user to print reports and labels to 
 unintended devices.
  
 HD0000000175185 concerns the Pick List Warning Message.  A user created 
 a pick list with a stop date which was far into the future.  This made 
 the pick list inaccessible, and the list could not be deleted.  A 
 warning message will be displayed to the pharmacist if the pick list 
 stop date is more than 7 days into the future.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses one Patient Safety Issue, PSI 06 101, contained
in two Remedy tickets: HD153724 and HD166076.
 
This patch constitutes the Inpatient Pharmacy portion of a multi-package
build. It addresses Remedy ticket HD153724. The BCMA patch PSB*3*33
addresses the BCMA portion, Remedy ticket HD166076.
 
The site reported Unit Dose medication orders entered with a schedule
of ONE TIME PRN were not automatically discontinued after being
given in Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) Version 3.0. As a
result, the medication was given multiple times, despite the ordering
provider's intent to allow only one optional dose. In this scenario, ONE
TIME is the name of a schedule defined in the Administration Schedule
file with a type of One Time.
 
Based on workgroup feedback, the issue will be addressed by treating any
order containing a One Time schedule (i.e., a schedule defined in the
Administration Schedule File with a type of One Time) as a order that is
to be given only once, regardless of the order's Schedule Type, or the
presence of the PRN modifier appended to the order's schedule. The
letters PRN are appended to the schedule name when the PRN check box is
checked during order entry, from the ordering dialog in CPRS. The PRN may
also be appended to the schedule name manually from Inpatient Medications
Version 5.0 order entry options.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch will be released as the Inpatient Medications portion of
the Pharmacy Legacy Quarterly Enhancements team's FY09 Q4 effort.
 
This enhancement will address Patient Safety Issue PSI-07-055,
PSPO #508, Remedy Ticket #180596, and was approved by the Inpatient
Medications Workgroup.
 
Problem
-------
Currently, for complex unit dose orders that contain an "AND" conjunction,
there is a possibility of the child orders containing overlapping
administration (admin) times. If the admin times overlap, it is possible
for a patient to receive too much of the medication at the overlapping
admin time.
 
Resolution
----------
This enhanced functionality will compare the admin time string of the
child orders on either side of the "AND" conjunction and will capture
any overlapping admin times. If any overlapping admin times are
found, a warning message will be displayed to the pharmacist who is
finishing the order. The warning message will read:
 
**WARNING**
 
The highlighted admin times for these portions of this complex order 
overlap.
 
Part 1 has a schedule of BID and admin time(s) of 10-22.
Part 2 has a schedule of QDAY and admin time(s) of 10.
 
Please ensure the schedules and administration times are appropriate.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-17.html">USER,SEVENTEEN</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Patches PSJ*5*214 and PSN*4*193 are being released as part of the Class
III to Class I conversion process.  In combination, the two 
patches address the need to provide multidivisional functionality within
the Inpatient Medications package's Patients on Specific Drug(s) [PSJ
PDV] option. PSN*4*193 provides support within the National Drug File
package and PSJ*5*214 delivers the enhanced functionality of the Patients
on Specific Drug(s) [PSJ PDV] option.
  
This patch contains the following items:
 
1. The option would quit prematurely after the user entered an up-arrow to
exit a previous attempt to generate the report.
 
Problem:
--------
The variable QFLG used to denote the user's attempt to quit the option was
left defined following the aborted report attempt.
 
Resolution:
-----------
Routine PSJPDV updated to NEW variable QFLG.
 
2. To generate a report for all drugs within a parent drug class required 
entry of each child class when specifying the report parameters.
 
Problem:
--------
There was no cross-reference in the VA DRUG CLASS file (#50.605) to
determine the relationship between parent drug classes and 
child drug classes.
 
Resolution:
-----------
Patch PSN*4*193 introduces the necessary cross-reference, which is 
utilized by this patch to allow a user to enter a parent drug class.  The 
system will then select all of the drugs in the hierarchy of that parent 
class.
 
3.  The default response for the Number of Matches prompt did not 
reflect the most common answer to that question.
 
Problem:
--------
Current functionality would count the number of unique entries selected 
by the user and present that number as a default response to the Number 
of Matches prompt.  This assumed that a patient had to have all of the 
selected drugs in their profile in order to be listed in the final report.
 
Resolution:
-----------
The default is changed to 1, reflecting a report in which the patient can 
be on any of the selected drugs in order to be listed on the report.  The 
user can still enter a higher number to employ the previously defaulted 
functionality.
 
4.  The existing program did not include functionality to support the 
reporting needs of integrated or multidivisional facilities.
 
Problem:
--------
The report parameters do not ask for limitation of the output to 
specified divisions, wards, or ward groups.  The resulting list always 
included all patients meeting the criteria across an entire VistA 
database.
 
Resolution:
-----------
A prompt is added to allow the user to select the DIVISION(s)
from which patients will be reported.  Sites that have only 1 division
associated with all of their inpatient wards will not see this new prompt.
 
A prompt is added to allow the user to select the WARDS(s) from which
patients will be reported.
 
If no selection is made for the division or ward prompt, the user will 
be allowed to select one WARD GROUP from which patients will be reported.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The purpose of this patch is to provide software enhancements for Order
Validation defined by the BCMA-Inpatient Medications Request for
Special Focus Group (SFG) Initial Request Analysis (IRA)
 
Currently, Inpatient Medications allows orders to be created with
conflicting administration times, frequencies, schedules, and schedule
types such that orders may not always display correctly on the Virtual
Due List (VDL) in the Barcode Medication Administration (BCMA)
application. This enhancement adds several new order validation checks
to improve the data that is displayed on the VDL. These order
validation requirements will apply to Unit Dose Medications and applied
to intermittent IV orders schedules (IV orders do not have Schedule
Type).
 
These enhancements are:
 
1.  Order Validation Check One
For Intermittent IV orders, references to an order's Schedule Type will
refer to either the TYPE OF SCHEDULE from the Administration Schedule
file (#51.1), or PRN for schedule names in PRN format, or CONTINUOUS
for schedule names in Day of Week format.
 
2.  Order Validation Check Two
If an order has the Schedule Type of Continuous and the Schedule
entered is NOT in Day of Week (Ex. MO-FR) or PRN (Ex. TID PC PRN)
format, then the system shall prevent the number of administration
times associated with the order from being greater than the number of
administration times for that frequency, if the orders frequency is
numeric (minutes).  The number of administration times can be less than
but not equal to zero administration times.
 
3.  Order Validation Check Three
If an order has a Schedule Type of Continuous and is an Odd Schedule, a
schedule whose frequency is not evenly divisible by or into 1440
minutes (1 day), then the system shall prevent the entry of
administration times.
 
4.  Order Validation Check Four
If an order has a Schedule Type of Continuous with a non-odd frequency
of greater than of 1 day (1440 minutes) then the system shall prevent
more than one administration time.
 
5.  Order Validation Check Five
If an order has a Schedule Type of One Time or if an order is entered
with a schedule that is defined in the schedule file as One Time then
the system shall prevent the user from entering more than one
administration time.
 
6.  Order Validation Check Six
For an order with a Schedule Type of Continuous where no
doses/administration times are scheduled between the order's Start
Date/Time and the Stop Date/Time, then the system shall present a
warning message to the user and not allow the order to be accepted or
verified until the Start/Stop Date Times, schedule, and/or
administration times are adjusted so that at least one dose is
scheduled to be given.
 
7.  Change the Sequence of the Schedule Type and Schedule Prompts
Currently the order of the prompts in inpatient meds order entry is
Schedule Type followed by Schedule.  The sequence of the prompts will
be changed so that the Schedule prompt falls before the Schedule Type
prompt.
 
8.  Schedule Validation Requirement One
When a schedule is selected at the Schedule Field the system shall
default the Schedule Type for the schedule entered from the Schedule
File into the order.
 
9.  Schedule Validation Requirement Two
If the user changes the schedule, they will be given a warning message
that the administration times and the schedule type for the schedule
selected will be defaulted to this order.
 
10.  Schedule Validation Check Three
If the schedule type is changed from Continuous to PRN the system shall
automatically remove any administration times that were associated with
the schedule so that the order will not include administration times.
 
11.  Modify VistA Help Text
The Help Text in Inpatient Order Entry was modified to add additional
text so the user is able to see the added constraints when entering
Administration Times.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Patch PSJ*5*214 introduced an enhancement to the Patients on Specific 
Drug(s) [PSJ PDV] option in which a user could select a parent (or major) 
VA DRUG CLASS and the system would respond as if the user had entered 
each of the corresponding child (or minor) drug class.
 
The enhancement broke the ability for the option to display data for 
parent classes that have drugs directly assigned to them, such as IN000 
(Investigational Agents) or HA000 (Herbs/Alternative Therapy).
 
This patch PSJ*5*239 will restore the ability for the report to identify 
the drugs that are directly assigned to a parent VA class.
 
1. Selection of VA Drug Class IN000 (Investigational Agents) in the 
Patients on Specific Drug(s) option no longer returns any data.
 
Problem:
--------
The enhancements written to allow user selection of a parent drug class, 
and the intended system response to return all items associated with its
child drug classes, did not correctly search for drug items directly 
assigned to the parent class itself.
 
Resolution:
-----------
Revise search algorithm to select drugs assigned to the parent class 
first, then resume the process to traverse the drug class hierarchy of 
child classes.

 - In Abbreviated Order Entry, the "Schedule:" prompt appears twice.
 - Pending renewal orders incorrectly fail schedule validation in Speed
   Finish.
 
Remedy Overview
------------------
1. HD0000000413812
 
 Problem:
 --------
 For users defined with an order entry process of ABBREVIATED in the
 Inpatient User Parameters Edit [PSJ SEUP] option, the "Schedule:"
 prompt appears twice when creating a new order via the Inpatient Order
 Entry [PSJ OE] option.
 
 Solution:
 ---------
 For users defined with an order entry process of ABBREVIATED in the
 Inpatient User Parameters Edit [PSJ SEUP] option, prompt for
 "Schedule:" only once when creating a new order via the Inpatient Order
 Entry [PSJ OE] option.
 
 
2. HD0000000414155
   HD0000000415173
 
 Problem:
 --------
 Pending Continuous Unit Dose renewal orders with valid schedule/admin
 time combinations fail schedule validation when the SF - Speed Finish
 action is used within the Order Entry [PSJU NE] option, but they pass
 schedule validation, without edits, when the manual FN - Finish action
 is used. These orders can't be finished using Speed Finish, and must be
 finished using the manual FN - Finish action.
 
 Solution:
 ---------
 Within the Order Entry [PSJU NE] option, allow Continuous Unit Dose
 orders with schedule/admin time combinations that pass the manual FN -
 Finish action's schedule validation to also pass the SF - Speed Finish
 action's schedule validation.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-17.html">USER,SEVENTEEN</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Patch PSJ*5*179 Will correct the following issues.
 
1.  HD0000000099382 - PSI-05-053 Drug dose can be administered twice.
When a dose is given in Bar Code Medication Administration for an
Inpatient Order, the order is marked in BCMA as GIVEN.  If a Pharmacist
edit's a field with a star (*), the new order may overwrite the
administration that was given in BCMA.  The possibility of giving the
patient a "double" dose exists.
 
2. HD0000000195783 - IMO Location not getting default stop date.
When using inpatient medications for Outpatient Orders, the 
correct stop date is not displayed on the patient profile of the
Backdoor Pharmacy Order Entry screen.  If there is a value defined in
Clinic Definition File for the "NUMBER OF DAYS UNTIL STOP field, the
order should use the default stop date. Currently this default stop date
is not used when the order is finished as a unit dose.
 
3. HD0000000210901 - PSI-07-172 Reads of File 51.1 not checking Package
                     Prefix.
When calculating the default Stop Date/Time for a Unit Dose order, 
Inpatient Medications uses the schedule type field from the Administration
Schedule File (#51.1) to determine which Inpatient Ward Parameter
should be used.  The Days Until Stop Date/Time or Days Until Stop for 
One-time will be used.  
However, the package prefix is not used when retrieving the schedule
type from the Schedule File and as result, the wrong schedule and
schedule type could be used.  This will result in an incorrect default
Stop Date/Time being calculated. 
be calculated.
 
4.  HD0000000237637 - Editing Admit time, then comments renders no change.
Updates to the admin time field are not accepted when editing the admin
time on an existing Unit Dose order, then editing the comment field. 
The original admin time will remain.  
This also happens when the user edits the comment field first.

Incorrect stop dates are being populated when an IV medication order is

finishes the order as an IV piggyback and additives do not exist (are not

FY11 Pharmacy Legacy Enhancements (PSPO 738/PSI-07-122)
 
The enhancement contained in this patch revises the existing display in
the Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW] option from a patient list
sorted alphabetically by TEAM and PATIENT NAME to a categorized listing
sorted by a patient's highest priority order.
 
Patients that have one or more STAT Pending or Non-Verified orders will
be listed first, followed by patients with one or more ASAP Pending or
Non-Verified orders, and then all other patients that have only ROUTINE
Pending or Non-Verified orders. Within a given priority, patients will
continue to be sub-sorted alphabetically by TEAM name and PATIENT name.
 
Examples shown here.  Note the addition of PRIORITY column.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch will resolve the following issues in the Inpatient 
Medications package:
 
- When a user is prompted for dosage in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE], a 
response of null will no longer be allowed.
 
-When a user edits the dispense drug or units per dose on a unit dose 
order, the following message will not be displayed if the dispense drug 
times the unit per dose matches with the dosage ordered.
 
 WARNING: Dosage Ordered and Dispense Units do not match.
        Please verify Dosage
 
The fix in this patch will display the warning message only when the 
dosage ordered is NOT equal to the dispense drug times (X) the units 
per dose.  Also, when the warning message displays, the Dosage Ordered 
and Dispense Drug items will display in reverse video.

****************************** Note **************************************
This patch is a follow-up defect patch for Medication Order Check
Healthcare Application v1.0 (MOCHA).  The MOCHA v1.0 patches are being 
released as a phased implementation release.  To see current status and
target dates for Sites/VISN/Region please refer to the following site:
 
http://vaww.itfo.portal.domain.ext/svcs/itfopmo/pre05/default.aspx
 
Sites will be provided instructions and guidance on installation and of a
phased release for MOCHA 1.0, and this patch PSJ*5*263 should be installed
after MOCHA 1.0 installation.
 
**************************************************************************
 
1. When the provider placed an IV order on hold, the code "HP" was
displayed for the order on the Inpatient Meds profile.  "HP" was still
displayed on the patient profile on the pharmacy side when the provider
released hold.  The order status was correctly changed back to active.  
Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) was working with an active order
even though the display code was indicating hold by provider.  This patch
is removing the "HP" so the appropriate status is displaying on the
profile. HD0000000503309 (Code Change Request(CCR) #4466)
 
2. When no active dispense drug was found for an active unit dose order, 
the order was not included in the Drug Interaction and Duplicate 
Therapeutic checks for Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).  This 
patch will ensure a dispense drug is included for the order checks.  (CCR 
#4465)
 
3. An undefined error occurred when using the order set with more than 
one order.  This happened when one of the orders was edited and the 
variable PSJNOO was killed.  This lead to an undefined when continued 
entering a subsequence order from the order set. HD0000000505659 (CCR 
#4503)
 
4. The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Workgroup and Patient
Safety requested Inpatient Medications shows the bottle/bag number in
parenthesis on the finishing screen for an IV order.  This change will
display the bottle number within the parenthesis for IV orders on the
profiles and the order view. Change Request(CR) #3815, CCR #3815
 
5. The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Workgroup and Patient 
Safety requested Inpatient Medications shows the 'See Comments' next to IV
additive name if applicable on the finishing screen for an IV order.  This
change will display 'See Comment' within the parenthesis for IV orders on
the profiles and the order view.  The user must enter the appropriate
bottle/bag number before completing the order. CR #2534, CCR #2990
 
6. This patch also fixes an issue in the IV Profile where additive data is
not wrapped appropriately.

This patch will correct the following issues:
 
1. If the Units per Dose of an order are entered as "0" or a non-numeric

   documentation, which states that under these circumstances, the units 
   per dose should be 1.
 
2. Intermittent as needed (PRN) IV Orders created by CPRS which should 
   have no value in the SCHEDULE INTERVAL field (#.17) of the IV SUB-FILE 
   (#55.01) are being incorrectly set to 1440 (1 day).
 
3. Intravenous push (IVP) orders are not showing up on the medicatinos 
   due worksheet.
 
4. The Meds tab in CPRS is not showing active orders that have been 
   placed on HOLD when the sort type is by Drug (Alphabetical).
 
5. In CPRS, when the ORCH CONTEXT MEDS parameter is not set, some 
   non-active orders visible even though none should be.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch contains the following enhancement:
 
1. This patch implements functionality that retrieves Computerized
   Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0 order checks and corresponding
   provider override reason from the Order Check Instances (#100.05)
   file, and provides the order checks and provider override reason
   to Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) V. 3.0 for display
   in the BCMA Display Order report.
 
 
This patch contains the following two defect fixes:
 
1. This patch corrects an issue in Bar Code Medication Administration
   V. 3.0 in which orders do not display on the Virtual Due List (VDL) 
   if the order's Schedule Type is Continuous or Fill on Request, and 
   the order contains a Schedule defined in the Administration Schedule 
   File (#51.1) with a Schedule Type of On Call.
 
2. This patch corrects an issue in Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 in which
   changing a Non-Verified order's Schedule Type to On Call automatically
   changes the name of the order's Schedule to On Call without alerting 
   the user.

Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0 provider override
reasons and the order checks that were overridden, as well as pharmacist
intervention information from Inpatient Medications V. 5.0, when at
least one overridden critical drug-drug interaction and/or allergy/ADR
interaction is associated with an Inpatient order. An API has also
been added to supply this information to Bar Code Medication
Administration (BCMA) V. 3.0.
 
******************************* WARNING **********************************
 
If your facility has the Pyxis/Omnicell/McKesson interface from ILC this
patch will overwrite any local modifications in routines PSGOEE and
PSGOETO. This could affect certain orders being sent across this
interface. The modifications will have to be reintroduced following
installation of this patch.
 
**************************************************************************
 
1. This patch will implement functionality to utilize the Order Check
   Instances (#100.05) file to retrieve and display CPRS provider override
   reasons and the order checks that were overridden, when at least one
   critical drug-drug interaction and/or allergy/ADR interaction is
   associated with an Inpatient order.
 
2. An Order Checks/Interventions (OCI) indicator has been added to
   indicate a CPRS provider override or pharmacy intervention of at least
   one critical drug-drug interaction and/or allergy/ADR interaction
   exists for the current order. An "OCI" hidden action has also been
   added to display the same CPRS overrides and/or pharmacist
   interventions.
 
   The OCI indicator and hidden action have been added to the Detailed
   Order List Manager screens when utilizing the following options:
    - Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE]
    - Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW]

Enhancements
=====================
 
1. Special Instructions/Other Print Info
 ________________________________________
 With this enhancement, Special Instructions and Other Print Info have
 been modified to support an unlimited amount of text. The existing
 functionality that copies the provider comments from the Computerized
 Patient Record System (CPRS) to be copied into each field has been
 retained, and an additional action has been added to optionally open a
 word processing edit dialog after copying the provider comments into the
 appropriate field (Special Instructions for Unit Dose, Other Print Info 
 for IV).
 
 Special Instructions and Other Print Info may also be entered
 and/or edited from within Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 order entry 
 options.
 
 Prior to this enhancement, Inpatient Medications maximum character
 length for Special Instructions was 180 characters and for Other Print
 Info the maximum length was 60 characters. This enhancement resolves
 Patient Safety Issues PSPO 42, 1466 / Remedy Ticket HD336419
 - Comment lengths between CPRS and Pharmacy.
 
2. No Allergy Assessment
 ________________________ 
 The No Allergy Assessment enhancement provides an interactive alert to
 the pharmacist in Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 when no allergy assessment
 is on file for the patient, and a method for the pharmacist to enter an
 allergy assessment after receiving the alert.  A pharmacy intervention 
 is automatically created if the pharmacist chooses to not enter an
 assessment. 
 
 The No Allergy Assessment functionality will be available at the 
 following options:
 
   Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE]
   Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW]
   Order Entry [PSJU NE]
   Order Entry (IV) [PSJI ORDER]
   Profile (IV) [PSJI PROFILE]
 
When a patient with no allergy assessment is selected from one of the
affected options, the following message will be displayed to the
pharmacist: 
 
"NO ALLERGY ASSESSMENT exists for this patient! Would you like to enter
one now?" 
 
 - If the pharmacist enters 'YES' at this prompt, they are prompted
   for allergy information. 
 - If the pharmacist enters 'NO' at this prompt, a pharmacist intervention
   is created, with a type of 'NO ALLERGY ASSESSMENT'. The pharmacist is
   then prompted for Provider and Recommendation. A new Recommendation,
   'UNABLE TO ASSESS', has been created specifically  for this type of 
   intervention.
 
 This enhancement will address Patient Safety Issue PSPO 445.
 
 
Defects Addressed
=========================
 
1. HD 187184 - IV Med Stop Date
 
   Problem
   -------
   When an IV order is renewed the status automatically changes to
   expired, but the stop date does not change to the time the order
   actually stops.
 
   Resolution
   ----------
   Routine PSJHL3 has been modified to correctly set the stop date of the
   order that has been renewed to the time of renewal. 
 
 
 2. HD 176676/PSPO 480 - Inpatient doesn't change order status to Expired.
    
    Problem
    -------
    The Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 package does not change order status
    to Expired when sending orders to CPRS with Stop Date/Time in the 
    past.
 
    Solution:
    ---------
    Routine PSJHL3 has been modified to change the order status to 
    Expired, if the order's Stop Date/Time is in the past, when sending 
    orders to CPRS. 
    **This is a partial solution addressing Inpatient Medications V.5.0
      functionality only. Patch OR*3*350 addresses CPRS GUI functionality.
 
 3. HD 377288 (original) - Default response should be "No"
    
    Problem
    -------
    When an Inpatient Unit Dose order's Dosage Ordered field does not 
    match the dosage indicated by the Dispense Drug and Units per 
    Dose fields, the warning prompt "Would you like to continue
    verifying the order?" is displayed after accepting the order via the 
    AC-Accept action. The prompt's default response is "Yes", even though 
    the order is flawed.
                         
    The Inpatient Medications Workgroup has requested 
    this be changed to "No".
 
    Solution
    -------- 
    When an Inpatient Unit Dose order's Dosage Ordered fi eld does not 
    match the dosage indicated by the Dispense Drug and Units per 
    Dose fields, the default response for the prompt "Would you like to
    continue verifying the order?" will be changed to "No", as requested 
    by the Inpatient Medications Workgroup.
 
 
 4. HD 273000 (original) - Field Validation Not Correct
 
    Problem
    -------
    When a second Dispense drug is added to a Unit Dose medication order,
    and no Dosage Ordered is selected, the following message display:
 
        THE FOLLOWING IS EITHER INVALID OR MISSING FROM THIS ORDER:
 
        THIS FIELD IS NECESSARY FOR VERIFICATION.
        Enter RETURN to continue or '^' to exit: 
 
    Note that there is no actual field name displayed as an invalid field.
    This is incorrect. 
 
    Solution
    --------
    In CHK^PSGOEV the variable CHK gets set to 8 and there is no handling
    for a value of 8. The message is correct when CHK is set to 7.
 
 
 5. HD 517634/PSPO 2137 - Provider Comments not displayed.
 
    Problem
    -------
    Provider Comments for continuous IV orders are not displaying in CPRS
    after the order is verified in Inpatient Medications.
 
    Resolution
    ----------
    When IV orders are verified in Inpatient Medications, if the order
    contains Provider Comments, include the Provider Comments in the
    update sent to CPRS in order to keep the order synchronized.
 
 6. HD 586428/PSPO 2137 - Provider Comments not displayed after Verify.
 
    Problem
    -------
    When an IV order is created with Provider Comments, and then edited
    prior to verification so as to trigger the creation of a new order,
    Provider Comments do not carry over to the new order if auto-verify 
    is not used. As a result, the verifying pharmacist may not see the
    original Provider Comments.
 
    Solution
    --------
    Prior to the initial verification of an order, the original Provider 
    Comments should carry over to new a order created due to edit, so that
    the pharmacist verifying the order has an opportunity to see the 
    Provider Comments.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch is designed and intended to "decouple" the automated dispensing
machine interface calls from the current Inpatient Medication (IP) package
routines. The interfaces calls are currently imbedded in regular "patched
routines" at the sites using a Pyxis, Omnicell, or McKesson automated
dispensing machine. This patch creates a new "shell" routine  (PSJADM) which
 interface calls can be added. The routines being affected by
"decoupling" are PSGOEE, PSGOETO, PSGOEV, PSJHLV, PSJCOMR, and PSJOEA2. In
the past, anytime these routines were patched at the sites using one of the
machines listed above, the local modified routine(s) would have to be
backed up and saved before patching could occur. The local mods would be
lost otherwise. After patching, the patched routines would
have to be incorporated into the locally modified routines in order for the
automated dispensing machines to operate properly and appropriately.

Edit Clinic Med Orders Start Date/Time
======================================
This patch implements a new Vista option that allows users to
quickly find clinic orders that are associated with a specific
clinic location (or specific patient), and date range, and quickly 
change the Start Date/Time of one or more selected clinic orders.
 
The new option EDIT CLINIC MED ORDERS START DATE/TIME [PSJ ECO] allows
the user to search for clinic orders by clinic group, clinic, or by
patient. After entering a clinic group, clinic, or patient, a beginning
and ending date range must be entered to find orders with a start
date/time within the specified range.
 
When searching by clinic, all patients with at least one clinic order
for the specified clinic and date range are displayed in a list, and
one or more patients may be selected from the list. After a patient is
selected, only clinic orders matching the specified clinic and date range 
are displayed.
 
When searching by clinic group, all patients with at least one clinic 
order in the specified clinic group are displayed in a list, and one or
more patients may be selected from the list. After a patient is selected,
only the clinic orders matching the specified clinic group and date range 
are displayed.
 
When searching by patient, clinic location is not specified, therefore, 
all clinic orders within the selected date range are displayed, for 
all clinic locations.
 
For searches by clinic and by patient, from the clinic profile view, 
one or more clinic orders may be selected for start date/time editing.
The new start date/time is entered once, and applied to all selected
clinic orders. 
 
Two new actions are available from the clinic profile view: VP (View
Profile), and VD (View Details). The VP (View Profile) action displays 
the full Inpatient medication profile, and the VD (View Details) action
prompts for a specific clinic order from the numbered list, and
displays the detailed view of the order.
 
 
Patient Profile Clinic Orders
=============================
Clinic Orders will display in the patient profile grouped by Clinic, 
separate from non-Clinic Orders. Clinic Orders will display after all 
active, pending, and non-verified non-Clinic Orders. Non-Active 
non-Clinic orders will display after Clinic Orders.
 
The following menu options, and any actions that execute these options,
will be enhanced to separate clinic orders from non-clinic orders:
 
      Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] 
      Order Entry [PSJU NE] 
      Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW] 
      Order Entry (IV) [PSJI ORDER] 
      Patient Profile (IV) [PSJI PROFILE]
      Action Profile  #1 [PSJU AP-1] 
      Action Profile #2  [PSJU AP-2]

  2359 - Provider comments intended for a specific order are copied on
         another order upon renewal.
  
  
 Remedy Ticket(s) &amp; Overview
 ---------------------------
  HD 764596/781899 - Other Print Info display incorrectly.
  
   Problem
   --------
   When two or more Pending IV renews or Non-Verified edited IV orders
   containing Other Print Info are selected in Inpatient Order Entry using
   a dash, 1-3 to view orders 1, 2, and 3, the orders following the first
   order mistakenly display the first order's Other Print Info. 
  
   Solution
   --------
   When selecting multiple Pending Renewed IV orders or multiple
   Non-Verified edited IV orders by using a dash in Inpatient Order Entry,
   initialize contents of Other Print Info between orders so the Other
   Print Info is displayed with the proper order.
 
 
  HD 760186 - Other Print Info from IV Quick Code not used.
  
   Problem
   --------
   Other Print Info copied in from Provider Comments not being overwritten
   by Other Print info in a selected IV Quick Code.
 
   Solution
   --------
   Restore previous functionality. When an order that can be finished as 
   Unit Dose or IV is finished as an IV, and the user is prompted for  
   Additive, if the finishing pharmacist enters an IV Quick Code that 
   contains Other Print Info text, that text should overwrite the contents
   of the order's Other Print Info.
 
  
  HD 763244 - Undefined error in 7 Day Mar.
  
   Problem
   --------
   Undefined error occurs when printing a PRN IV order in the 7Day MAR
   [PSJU 7D MAR] option.
  
   Solution
   ---------
   Prevent undefined error from occurring.
  
  
  HD 756354 - Undefined error in CPRS IV label print.
  
   Problem
   --------
   Undefined error occurs when printing an IV Label from the Chart Copy
   dialog after signing an order in CPRS.
          
   Solution: Prevent undefined error from occurring.
  
  
  HD 763555 - Wrong intervention recommendation is filed.
  
   Problem
   --------
   NO ALLERGY ASSESSMENT type of intervention does not file correct
   recommendation when custom entries are present in the APSP INTERVENTION
   RECOMMENDATION (#9009032.5) file.
  
   Solution
   ---------
   Enable the NO ALLERGY ASSESSMENT type of interventions to handle custom
   entries in the APSP INTERVENTION RECOMMENDATION (#9009032.5) file.
          
  
  HD 770025 - Long Special Instructions not retained after CPRS Renew
  
   Problem
   --------
   Long Special Instructions (greater than 180 characters) and Other Print
   Info (greater than 60 characters) are not carried over to the Pending 
   renewal order after the order is renewed in CPRS.
  
   Solution
   --------
   Retain long Special Instructions (greater than 180 characters) and
   Other Print Info (greater than 60 characters) in the Pending renewal
   order when the order is renewed from CPRS.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Patch PSJ*5*275 introduced an issue with the Inpatient Profile that 
caused very old, corrupted Unit Dose orders display on the Inpatient
Profile. This patch corrects the problem.
 
Prior to PSJ*5*275, the Inpatient Profile attempted to display only Unit 
Dose orders with a stop date later than the patient's last admission 
date. Orders within this same period were checked for auto-expiration; if 
the order's stop date was in the past, the status was changed to expired. 
 
Orders with stop dates earlier than the last admission date were ignored 
by the profile; their statuses were not updated, and they were not 
displayed.
 
Patch PSJ*5*275 attempted to make the inpatient profile consistent by
honoringing the HOURS OF RECENTLY DC/EXPIRED (#7) field in the INPATIENT
WARD PARAMETERS (#59.6) file so that no order would display if its stop
date was older than the value defined by this parameter. However, the 
patch incorrectly retrieved the parameter's nominal 'hours' value 
instead of its calculated 'date' value (derived by subtracting the hours 
from the current date/time), so that regardless of the value of the
parameter, virtually no orders were ignored when displaying the profile.
 
Finally, while patch PSJ*5*275 changed how far into the past the profile 
began searching for orders' stop date, the process that auto-expired 
orders from the inpatient profile did not change, allowing corrupted 
orders with stop dates in the past, and statuses of active or renewed, 
to display in the patient's Inpatient medication profile without 
performing a corresponding auto-expire on these orders.
 
This patch corrects the issue by changing how the inpatient profile 
begins to look for orders with stop dates in the past to the calculated 
value of the HOURS OF RECENTLY DC/EXPIRED (#7) field in the INPATIENT 
WARD PARAMETERS (#59.6) file subtracted from the current date/time.
 
For Example, given two active orders with stop dates in the past, and an
             admission date, and a HOURS RECENTLY DC/EXPIRED value, the 
             following functionality would be observed prior to PSJ*5*275,
             with PSJ*5*275, and after PSJ*5*275:
 
           Current Date/Time : 06/06/2013@1300 
         Last Admission Date : 06/04/2013@1300
HOURS OF RECENTLY DC/EXPIRED : 120
                     Order 1 : Stop Date 01/01/2001@2400, Status=ACTIVE
                     Order 2 : Stop Date 06/03/2013@2400, Status=EXPIRED
                     Order 3 : Stop Date 06/05/2013@1200, Status=ACTIVE
           
                     
Prior to PSJ*5*275 :  (Order 1 is ignored and remains active)
                      (Order 2 is ignored and remains expired)

This patch addresses an issue with the ACTION PROFILE #2 [PSJU AP-2] 
report introduced by PSJ*5*275.
 
The change to the ACTION PROFILE #2 [PSJU AP-2] report in patch PSJ*5*275 
caused the report to only print the first patient found, regardless of 
how many patients should have printed, when the report was run by Ward or 
Ward Group. 
 
This patch corrects the report by ensuring all appropriate 
patients and their orders print on the report when the report is run by 
Ward or Ward Group.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 Patch PSJ*5.0*229 will correct the following issues.
 
 HD0000000339101 - PSPO# 00001478 - 1 IV order 3x/wk for 8 doses- when 
                   stop time is entered as 8, the computer calculates 
                   for 8 days not 8 doses
 Problem:
 --------
 Dose limit calculations are not correct when entered from the 
 infusion dialog in CPRS. There is no logic to calculculate day of week 
 schedules and schedules with a frequency greater than 1440 (dose to be 
 given more than once a day) calculate based on days instead of doses.
 
 HD0000000282450 - 4 stop date calculated incorrectly?
 Problem:
 --------
 When finishing a dose limit IV Piggyback order created in CPRS, the stop
 date would not adhere to the dose limit. If there was a stop time defined
 for a particular IV ROOM, the stop time would be tacked on, usually 
 setting the stop date past the last dose of the order. If there was no
 stop time defined, the system would tack on .2359 to the stop date, which
 would also usually set the stop date past the dose limit. Both of these
 scenarios would cause additional doses to be given.
 
 HD0000000347116 - 6 Edited infusion rate to remove 250 ml/hr@0 and 
                   scheduled labels still not printing
 Problem:
 --------
 When editing an IV order from an infusion rate with the ATZERO flag set
 to an infusion rate without the ATZERO flag, the labels still don't 
 print. The ATZERO flag is not being removed by an opposite edit.
 
 HD0000000217087 - IV Time frames in question
 Problem:
 --------
 The duration on IV orders is not calculating correctly. A duration of 23
 hours stops the order after 23 hours, and a duration of 25 hours stops 
 the order after 25 hours; however, a duration of 24 hours stops the 
 order at t+1 day @ 23:59 (23:59 is set by the inpatient ward parameter as
 a default time).

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch will address the Inpatient Medications portion of
the solution to Patient Safety Issue PSPO00001088 and New
Service Request (NSR) 20110308.  This patch must be installed
after patch PSS*1.0*174.
 
Patch PSS*1.0*174 introduced a new field into the
IV ADDITIVES File (#52.6).  The new field, STRENGTH (#19)
represents the numeric value of one unit-of-use for the
medication.
 
When viewing an order in Inpatient Medications, there is a
hidden action called "DIN", or "Drug Restrictions/Guidelines".
With this patch, when DIN is called on an IV order, the
IV Additive strength will be displayed along with the Drug Unit.
If the IV Additive Strength is not populated, the text "N/A"
will appear instead.
 
For example (STRENGTH populated):
 
Drug restriction/guideline info:
 
IV Additive: CEFAZOLIN   Additive Strength: 1 GM
 
 
   Orderable Item: CEFAZOLIN INJ
 
          No information available
 
   Dispense drug: CEFAZOLIN SOD 10GM M/D INJ
 
          No information available
 
 
For example (STRENGTH not populated):
 
IV Additive: CEFAZOLIN PREMIX   Additive Strength: N/A
 
 
   Orderable Item: CEFAZOLIN INJ
 
          No information available

IV Bag Logic
------------
This patch modifies Inpatient Order Entry so that when Inpatient orders
are edited, BCMA IV parameters are now checked to determine if IV labels
were invalidated as a results of the edit. If labels were invalidated, the
clinician making the edit is informed and a list of the invalidated IV
labels are displayed. The clinician is given an opportunity to print 
replacement labels, including when no new order is created as a result of 
the edit.
