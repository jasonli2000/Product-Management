<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
An undef error was reported when entering a date/time for the Inactive
Date for an AOU. An example of the error follows: 
 
Select Automatic Replenishment Option: SUPervisor's Menu 
 
Select Supervisor's Menu Option: SET Up AR/WS (Build Files) 
 
Select Set Up AR/WS (Build Files) Option: INA

Enter AOU Inactivation Dates 
 
Select PHARMACY AOU STOCK AREA OF USE (AOU): LYN'S MED ROOM 
 
INACTIVE DATE: T@1300  (JUN 13, 1996@13:00)
 
...One moment, please...  
 
There are items in this AOU that are currently active.  You may, at this
time, inactivate all of them as of JUN 13,1996@13:00.  
 
Do you want to do this? Yes//   (Yes) 
 
Now inactivating all currently active items as of JUN 13,1996@13:00??.?? 
.??.??.??.
&lt;UNDEF&gt;+18^PSGWAOUI:::4:0: 
 
The error occurs because the date/time response for the inactive date
field of the AOU is entered into the inactivation date field for the items
in the AOU and this field does not allow the entry of time.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: 
 ==========================
  This patch may be loaded during regular work hours without
  disruption to users.  It only affects users of the Automatic
  Replenishment/Ward Stock software.  
  Installation will take less than 5 minutes.  
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu and 
      answer NO to the question 'Shall I preserve what is on disk in a 
      separate back-up message ?'.  Answer YES to the prompt 'Want to 
      Continue with Load? YES//' 
  2.  Review your mapped set.  If the routine listed in the 
      ROUTINE INFORMATION section is mapped, it should be removed 
      from the mapped set at this time. The patched routine is not on
      the recommended mapping list.  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options 
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSGW*2.3*7): 
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT 
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will 
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
          (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).  
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will 
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in 
          the transport global.  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
       PSGW*2.3*7.  
  6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options and Options? 
      YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options you
      would like to place out of order, enter the following: 
         PSGW AOU INACTIVATION     Inactivate AOU 
  7.  MSM sites:  Please ensure you answer YES when asked if you want 
      to move the routines to other systems and indicate the appropriate 
      CPUs.  Alternately, you can wait until the installation is
      complete and move the routines listed in the ROUTINE INFORMATION
      section to all systems.  
  8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
An undef error was reported when entering a date/time for the Inactive
Date for an AOU. Patch 7 was issued to correct this problem and it
worked for dates other than the first nine days of a month.  This patch
will correct patch 7 and work for all dates in a month.  An example of the
error follows:

Select PHARMACY AOU STOCK AREA OF USE (AOU): LYN'S MED ROOM 
 
INACTIVE DATE: 8 1@1200  (AUG 01, 1996@12:00)
 
...One moment, please...  
 
There are items in this AOU that are currently active.  You may, at this
time, inactivate all of them as of AUG 1,1996@12:00.  
 
Do you want to do this? Yes//   (Yes) 
 
Now inactivating all currently active items as of AUG 1,1996@12:00??.??

&lt;UNDEF&gt;+18^PSGWAOUI:::4:0: 
 
The error occurs because the date/time response for the inactive date
field of the AOU is entered into the inactivation date field for the items
in the AOU and this field does not allow the entry of time.  Patch 7
extracted the first 11 characters of the date/time chosen and this
included the "@" sign on dates for the first nine days of a month.  This
patch will take the first piece of the date/time entered with the "@" as
the delimiter.

  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
      the Installation menu.  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options 
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSGW*2.3*11): 
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup 
          message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT 
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will 
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
          (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).  
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will 
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in 
          the transport global.  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
       PSGW*2.3*11.
  6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options and Options? 
      YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the options you

         Request (80 column)
         PSGW ON-DEMAND DELETE      Delete an On-Demand Request
  7.  MSM sites:  Please ensure you answer YES when asked if you want 
      to move the routines to other systems and indicate the appropriate 
      CPUs.  Alternately, you can wait until the installation is
      complete and move the routines listed in the ROUTINE INFORMATION
      section to all systems.  
  8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
      returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
      completion.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 A problem has been reported with the Standard Cost Report [PSGW STANDARD
COST REPORT].  The Standard Cost Report lists the cost for items in one
AOU, several AOUs, all AOUs, or an inventory group.  This cost represents
the dollar amount needed to bring each item from zero to its maximum
stock level.
The TOTAL COST field was computed by multiplying the item's stock level by
the AR/WS conversion factor found in the DRUG file (#50) and then by price
per dispense unit found in the DRUG file.  It was reported that if the
AR/WS conversion factor was anything other than one (1) then the Total
Cost for that item was off by a factor of the AR/WS conversion factor. The
AR/WS conversion factor will no longer be used in the calculation for the
total cost in this report.  This patch corrects this problem.

nodes from the data dictionary.  These extraneous nodes may cause errors
when running Pharmacy Benefits Management extracts.
