<dt>DESCRIPTION OF ENHANCEMENTS:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
     The Controlled Substances software will monitor and track the receipt,
inventory, and dispensing of controlled substances.  Automation of the
narcotic inventory process will permit pharmacists and inspectors to
perform vault inventories utilizing portable bar code readers.  Monthly (or
more frequent) inspections can be conducted by management, with
discrepancies in stock levels automatically identified.  This software
package addresses a Congressional material weakness for Drug
Accountability.

 Due to the placement of locks on globals when updating balances, the 
 time frame between the initial balance changes and the actual
 locking of the global can result in other users accessing similar 
 options that also change the balances. The result is erroneous data
 being stored in the drugs balance.
 
 Resolution: The locks on several options have been moved up to the point
 where the drug is first selected. This will ensure no other balance
 adjustments will be made to that drug until the user is finished with it.

The orders are described as "emergency", "unscheduled" or "priority".
 
Solution
========
The consensus is to use "priority" for the description of these orders.
The use of "emergency" and "unscheduled" will be replaced by "priority".

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 When the Rx (Prescription) Outpatient Dispensing Report [PSD RX 
 DISPENSING REPORT] option is generated, data is being excluded for
 some transactions because there is more than one entry with the
 exact date and time. The reports initial search base is one the date
 and time, therefore only the first record will be checked.
 
 The solution is to expand the loop to check other factors such as the
 pharmacy location or drug.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 When the inspector's log is printed, items marked as perpetual inventory
 are excluded from the report. This patch will allow items marked as
 perpetual inventory to be included on the report if the order status is
 also marked as "DELIVERED - ACTIVELY ON NAOU".
 
 Another problem corrected by this patch is with the process of marking
 a green sheet completed. If the user selects the completion status "OTHER 
 - REFERRED TO PHARMACY SUPERVISOR", and enters an up-arrow ('^') at the
 prompt for entering a referred reason the system creates an error. The
 error is that the entry in the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSACTION (#58.81)
 file will be upgraded to the selected order and completion statuses, the
 entry in the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY ORDERS (#58.8) will remain as it was.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Problem:
=======
In Outpatient Pharmacy when Rx refills are returned to stock the refill
is deleted. This deletion is not reflected in Controlled Substances 
and thus reports and Rx balances are not reflecting these changes.
 
Solution:
========
An API for Outpatient Pharmacy will be developed by Controlled Substances 
developers. This API will be called by Outpatient Pharmacy each time a 
refill is returned to stock. The API will decide whether the RX is a
controlled substance and store this information in order to inform users
of the Controlled Substances package of the status of an Rx refill.
Outpatient Pharmacy patch PSO*7*40 contains the API.
 
Problem:
=======
In some instances, two different personnel can release a CS script within
moments of each other. This cause confusion and errors in the drug's
balance.
 
Solution:
========
When a user selects a prescription, the global is instantly locked. Anyone
else trying to alter data in that prescription will be shown a message that
informs them that another user is editing that prescription.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
There is a problem in the Sign Out Dose for Patient [PSD NURSE DISPENSING] 
option.
 
The problem is in the part where the system displays the doses signed out
in the last 'X' hours. Although the user is signing out the dose for a   
particular ward, the program loops through each ward on file looking for 
the drug. It will show all the doses signed out. When it finds an entry  
that doesn't match the selected ward, an error message is generated.     
 
This error message restricts the user from returning a drug to one
NAOU if it has been signed out by another. This also creates a problem
by updating the balance in both wards.
 
The solution to this is to remove the checking on every ward, and just   
concentrate on the one at hand.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses the problems with updating balances and releasing
controlled substances outpatient prescriptions.
  
 The functionality format is as follows:
  
1. If a controlled substances prescription fill has been released, but the
   balance NOT adjusted for that specific fill (fill not posted) in the 
   Controlled Substances (CS) V. 3.0 package, the user will be able to
   post that prescription fill to adjust the controlled substances balance
   for that drug item.
  
2. If a controlled substances prescription fill has been released and
   posted (balance adjusted), the Controlled Substances V. 3.0 package 
   will not allow any further actions to be taken on that fill. 
   In other words, a user will only be able to post (balance adjust) 
   a specific controlled substances fill only once.
  
3. When returning to stock a controlled substances prescription fill
   through the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 software, the software will
   first check to see if the user holds the PSDMGR key. If yes, the user
   will be able to return the controlled substances prescription fill
   to stock and also to update the drug balance in the Controlled 
   Substances V. 3.0 package. If no, the user will NOT be able to return 
   the controlled substances prescription fill to stock OR update the 
   drug balance in the CS package. An electronic signature will be 
   required to return a controlled substances prescription to stock and 
   to update the drug balance. 
   
   The user will now be able to post and/or release a partial fill for a 
   Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy prescription.
 
4. Users will now be able to post and/or release controlled substances
   prescriptions with a status of DISCONTINUED  from the Controlled 
   Substances V. 3.0 package.Posting and/or releasing through the 
   Controlled Substances V. 3.0 package for prescriptions with
   the statuses of DELETED, DISCONTINUED BY PROVIDER and DISCONTINUED 
   (EDIT) will not be allowed.
 
5. If a prescription fill has been returned to stock, and later processed 
   again for dispensing, the user will be able to post and/or release the 
   prescription fill through the Controlled Substances V. 3.0 package as 
   long as the new fill date is greater than the return to stock date.
 
6. The Daily Activity Log (in lieu of VA FORM 10-2320) [PSD DAILY LOG] 
   option has been enhanced to clearly identify prescriptions that have 
   been returned to stock. 
   
7. When an item is received into the Controlled Substances V. 3.0 package 
   after already being received by procurement/supply, the system does 
   not check to see if the incoming item is stocked in the pharmacy 
   location. This creates problems with the correct items because a 
   balance adjustment cannot be performed on the non-stocked item. 
   The solution to this is to check to ensure the item is stocked in the 
   selected pharmacy location.
 
8. When using the Outpatient Rx's [PSD OUTPATIENT] option, it was reported
   that the system errors out with an illegal number when the user enters
   an entry such as "501-400E097" at the "Enter/Wand PRESCRIPTION
   number" prompt. This patch corrects this problem.
 
9. It was reported that the Suremed machine is displaying the Internal
   Entry Number (IEN) of the patient instead of the Social Security Number
   (SSN). Currently, the third piece of the PID segment of the HL7 message
   is set to the IEN. This patch ensures that the patient's SSN is sent in
   the third piece of the PID segment of the HL7 message.

The Office of the Medical Inspector, in collaboration with the Narcotics 
Diversion Advisory Group, requested development of tools to support and
monitor Pharmacy Service Schedule II narcotics inventory management to be
distributed to all medical centers.  This enhancement includes a new
standalone CS Monitoring Menu [PSD NM MENU] option containing reports
derived from VA FileMan templates used during site visits that were found
to be valuable in assisting sites with the monitoring of Schedule II
narcotics prescriptions.  These reports also allow for the monitoring of
controlled substance schedules C-II through C-V.  
  
This patch includes a new standalone menu option entitled CS Monitoring
Menu [PSD NM MENU] option that will not be attached to a menu. IRM
support personnel will need to assign the menu to the Narcotics Inspectors
and Pharmacy Managers at the site.  
  
Kernel's Option Access by user [XUOPTWHO] option will be attached to the CS
Monitoring Menu [PSD NM MENU] option upon patch installation. The
following new options are brought in with the menu: 
    
     CS Application Security Key Report [PSD NM SECURITY KEY] option

Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Strategic Healthcare Group in
collaboration with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), requested
the development of the first Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) VistA pilot
project, named Electronic Prescription Order Entry for Schedule II
Controlled Substances. The objective is to develop an electronic order
entry system for Schedule II controlled substances using digital
signatures. To make this project viable, modifications to the following
packages were identified:
National Drug File (NDF) V. 4.0
Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 1.0
Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0
Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) V. 7.0
Controlled Substances (CS) V. 3.0
 
This is the CS patch, which provides two new options entitled Digitally
Signed CS Orders Report [PSD DIGITALLY SIGNED ORDERS] and Digitally Signed
OP Released Rx Report [PSD DIG. SIGNED RELEASED RX] that will be added to
the Production Reports [PSD PRODUCTION REPORTS] menu. Once DEA's
regulations are revised and PKI can be fully implemented nationally, sites
that choose to activate the PKI functionality can use this option to
retrieve digitally signed orders for controlled substances.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 When the user uses the Return Medication to Stock [PSO RETURNED STOCK]
 option to return a controlled substance to stock, the Controlled 
 Substances 3.0 package is accessed to update the drug balance. During
 this process, the problems detailed below can occur.
 
 1. After updating the balances in Controlled Substances 3.0, the 
 Outpatient Pharmacy 7.0 software requires the user to enter comments
 concerning the transaction. If the user exits the program at this point,
 the item is not marked as returned to stock in the Prescription file
 (#52), therefore it can be selected again, and the balances updated in
 Controlled Substances 3.0 again.
 
 The solution for this is for an additional check on the transaction before
 allowing updating of balances in Controlled Substances 3.0.
 
 2. The second issue related to this process is that when the Controlled
 Substances 3.0 software is updating the balances, the name of the 
 dispensing site is retained. If the user then exits the Outpatient 
 Pharmacy 7.0 software, and accesses the Controlled Substances 3.0
 software, the user is not prompted for the name of the dispensing site.
 
 The solution for this is to not retain the name of the dispensing
 site.
 
 3. The third issue of this patch is on fills returned to stock, then
 re-issued. Controlled Substances 3.0 will not allow the release of 
 the new fill.
 
 The solution for this is to add additional checks on the prescription
 to ensure it is not the fill that was previously returned to stock.

With the deployment of Cache version 5, it was discovered that the short
lock timeout values could generate a lock failure. Patch DI*22*147, which
has already been released, provided a solution to resolve this issue and
future lock issues.
 
This patch instituted a new default lock timeout of three seconds based on
a global node setting of ^DD("DILOCKTM")=3.
 
In order to avoid the lock issue in Controlled Substances, this patch
modifies all routines that currently use a lock timeout value of less than
3 seconds to check for the node ^DD("DILOCKTM") and to use the value
defined there, otherwise the lock timeout value is set to a default value
of 3 seconds.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Patch PSD*3.0*71 addresses two (2) issues.
 
1. The recently released patch PSD*3*69 introduced a new key PSD TECH ADV,
   intended to allow a Controlled Substances technician access to some of
   the Pharmacist's menu as described in the PSD*3*69 patch description.
   Some users have expressed concerns related to the Outpatient Rx's [PSD
   OUTPATIENT] option because the new PSD TECH ADV key was supposed to
   allow the posting of the transaction but not allow the release of the
   prescription. This patch will now allow a holder of the PSD TECH ADV
   key to perform all the functionalities of the Outpatient Rx's [PSD 
   OUTPATIENT] option EXCEPT releasing prescriptions.
 
2. The use of the PSD TECH ADV key was extended to grant its holder
   access to the options listed below. These options are available on the
   Technician (CS Pharmacy) Menu [PSD PHARM TECH].
 
      Complete Green Sheet [PSD COMPLETE GS]
      Destroyed Drugs Report [PSD DEST DRUGS REPORT]
      DEA Form 41 Destroyed Drugs Report [PSD DESTROY DEA41]
      Destructions Holding Report [PSD DESTRUCTION HOLDING]
      Add Existing Green Sheets at Setup [PSD EXISTING GS]
      Green Sheet Transfer Between NAOUs Report [PSD GS TRANSFER (NAOU)
        REPORT]
      Transfer Drugs between Dispensing Sites [PSD TRANSFER VAULT DRUGS]
 
   Once the patch is installed, the options on the Technician (CS 
   Pharmacy) Menu [PSD PHARM TECH] will be similar to the list below.
 
     Select Technician (CS Pharmacy) Menu Option: 
 
             Print CS Dispensing Worksheet

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The e-Prescribing of Controlled Substances (ePCS) project, which is 
scheduled to be released later this year, will provide enhanced 
functionality to allow for the electronic prescribing of controlled
substances while meeting Drug Enforcement Administration's regulations and
requirements.
 
In preparation for this project, new security key PSDRPH is being added 
in this patch. This key authorizes pharmacists to finish/verify digitally
signed Schedule II-V Controlled Substance (CS) orders placed via
COMPUTERIZED PATIENT RECORD SYSTEM (CPRS) V. 3.0. It should be assigned
only to registered pharmacists working with Schedule II-V drugs.
 
The assignment of security key PSDRPH may be done at any time after the 
release of this patch to begin the setup process required for ePCS.
