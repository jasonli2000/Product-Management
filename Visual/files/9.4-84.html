 The following changes were made to address Y2K compliance issues.
  
 Routine   : PSUDP
 Line Tag  : PICKLST+10
 Exception : Setting the node in global ^XTMP("PSAPV",0) to DT+1 would not
             be appropriate for dates such as FEB 28th.
 Resolution: Changed to a "C^%DTC" call which uses FileManager to calculate
             the correct date.
  
 Line Tag  : PROCESS+11
 Exception : Flagged to be changed 
             $E(PSADT-100-(+$E(PSADT,4,5)=1*8800),1,5)*100
 Resolution: No change necessary, the code is calculating the previous
             month, and all Y@K checks appear to function correctly.
 
 Routine   : PSAUP1
 Line Tag  : XTMP+21
 Exception : Use of checking to see if number is &gt;90 does not comply with
             a 70-30 split.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;12 SEQ #9</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1999-06-03 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 1). When an adjustment is made to the balance of a drug in a pharmacy
 location or invoice, the adjustment activity is recorded, but the
 stored data is not updated. Some Drug Accountability programs make
 the adjustments internally before printing out the drug balances,
 while other programs do not make these necessary calculations. Other
 VISTA packages extract data from the Drug Accountability files on
 a regular basis, by not setting up the programs internally to make the
 calculations for the adjustments, the data they are obtaining is
 incorrect.
 
 2). There is a problem with invoices being marked as processed when 
 in fact they should not have been marked as such because there are
 data elements missing.
 Solution: When the individual line items are being processed the system
           checks the order unit. For a line item to successfully process
           as having an order unit, it must match one of the following 3
           conditions:
            a). The order unit is defined in the initial uploaded item
            b). An adjusted order unit has been entered
            c). The order unit is defined in the synonym multiple in
                the drug file.
 
 3). After installing patch #3, if an invoice is being processed that is
 already on file for the same order number, a string too long error
 occurs at INVOICE+17 of routine PSAPROC7. 
 
 4). Invoices are passing through the processing and verification portions 
 of Drug Accountability with no problem, however, when the system does
 the checking of the data for updating price and drug information, these
 problems are found, and nothing is updated.
 Solution: This is in part because of problem #2 above, the order unit.
           When the line item's data is being placed into the DRUG 
           ACCOUNTABILITY ORDER file (#58.811), the system assigns the
           order unit to be either the value initially entered on the 
           invoice, or the value in the synonym multiple, otherwise zero.
           No mention of the adjusted order unit. The order of assignment
           should be, synonym multiple, adjusted, then initial upload.
 
 5). Several facilities do not have their pharmacy locations defined
 properly in the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY STATS file (#58.8), which results in
 errors. Usually the error is an undefined variable PSACOMB.
 (fixed in routine PSAUTL1)
 
 6). Uploading of incomplete invoiced data is corrected.
 
 7). The dispense unit per order unit is no longer asked for on supply
 items.
 (PSAVER2 - If the user identifies the drug as supply, then they should 
 not be prompted for DUOU. Added a Line of code to check for PSASUPP.
 
 8). When the PSA IV ALL LOCATIONS is executed each evening as a background
 job, part of the OP dispensing functionality is to check each ward that
 is associated with the pharmacy location in the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY STATS
 file (#58.8). Currently the program will discontinue processing if the ward
 doesn't match the pharmacy location, BUT it also quits if the ward
 does match the location. Therefore no OP dispensing data is recorded.
 (fixed in routine PSAPSI3)
 
 9). Balances on Controlled Substances are not updated when the orders
 are verified.
 
 10). When an invoice is being processed/edited, the order unit field will
 display the order unit associated with the line item based on adjustment,
 invoice's order unit or the order unit in the synonym of the drug file.
 When this field is to be edited, the only choices displayed are the 
 original invoiced order unit or the drug file entry. If an adjustment
 had been made, the program ignored it. NOIS (HUN-1197-20485)
 (Fixed 13 Jan 99 in routine PSAPROC3).
 
 11). When patch PSA*3*3 was sent out, the second line syntax for the
 routines PSAUDP &amp; PSAUP1 which were released in patch PSA*3*6, was
 erased. These two routines are added to this patch with updated second
 line syntax.
 
 12). During the set up of a pharmacy location there was a problem with 
 the call to obtain the outpatient pharmacy location. If there was more
 than one location that was spelled similarly the program would take the
 first one as default.
 
 13). When the user is processing invoices, they can actually enter a
 &lt;RETURN&gt; at the select pharmacy location or select master vault prompt.
 the system will continue to process normally, but an error will occur
 in SITES+1^PSAUTL1. This value must be entered for proper processing.
 The user must now up-arrow out of the selection.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 1. This patch modifies the method used to update a drug's NDC and other
 pricing information.
  
 The revised method of updating the NDC and price information is as
 follows:
  
 If the NDC on an invoiced item does not match the NDC field (#31) in
 the DRUG file (#50), then the NDC entry in the DRUG file (#50) will be 
 changed to the invoiced NDC.
  
 If the invoiced item's Order Unit and Dispense Units per Order Unit match
 the same fields in the DRUG file, but the price of the dispense unit has
 changed then the following process occurs:
  
  a. The new price per dispense unit is compared with the PRICE PER
     DISPENSE UNIT field (#16) in the DRUG file (#50), to see if it is
     within 5%. If it is not within the 5% difference, the PRICE PER
     DISPENSE UNIT field (#16) in DRUG file (#50) is set to the invoiced 
     price per dispense unit, and the PRICE PER ORDER UNIT field (#13)
     in the DRUG file (#50) is set to the invoiced price per order unit.
 
  b. A MailMan message is sent to members of a new mail group called:
     'PSA NDC UPDATES' to inform them of the price change. The subject of
     this message is: "DRUG file Price/NDC Update".
  
  c. Because of the problems with price calculations in the past, a post
     patch install routine has been added to correct current incorrect
     prices.
 
 2. When processing invoices, the system checks for the pharmacy locations
 that will be used during processing. If no locations are found the 
 program proceeds to exit the option. However, in the exit logic the
 system checks to see if the user has up arrowed or if something has
 failed. If the exit variable has not been set, the program continues on
 to automatically enter the invoice into VISTA.
  
 3. Another problem this created was when the user would proceed with manual
 processing of these invoices, the pharmacy location field would be empty.
 This creates an undefined global node when the program tried to find the
 location name. If pharmacy locations are not set up, the exit variable
 is not set, therefore the invoices are processed.
  
 4. When the Connect Unlinked DRUG/ITEM MASTER file Entries [PSA UNLINKED 
    LOOP] option is executed an undefined error occurs. The problem stems
    from the user not selecting a drug to link to. The solution to this
    problem is to change where the routine is called.
  
 5. When printing the Verification Error Report if the report is printed to
    the screen or a slave printer it's fine. If the report is queued to a
    printer, none of the data prints out.
  
 The problem with this was that the variable saved for the print job was
 a simple variable, not a variable array as it should be.
 
 6. Due to site integration, invoices can sometimes be processed more
 than once. The invoice file is checked during uploading to see if the
 invoice currently exists, but the check is not performed when the user
 processes the information. The solution to this is a check being added
 that will compare the invoice's Order Number, Invoice Number and the
 line items against what is stored in VistA. If a close enough match is 
 found, a comparison array of data will be displayed for the user. After
 displaying the data, the user has the option of eliminating the incoming
 invoice.
 
 7. The option Delete Un-processed Invoices [PSA DELETE INVOICES] has been
 created to delete invoices that are on file past a user specified date.
 
 8. When processing invoices, if an item has the same vendor stock number
 but different NDCs, a new synonym entry is created. When the item is
 being processed again, the system will display the same drug as two
 different choices. The problem is, that there is not enough detailed
 information provided for proper selection. The solution to this was to
 add the NDC to the display.
 
 9. When invoices are processed for multiple divisions, or by multiple
 personnel, all invoices show the same person as the processor. This
 was caused by the last function of processing. When the user finishes
 processing, the program would look at each invoice. If the invoice
 was marked as processed, the data would be moved into the proper files.
 the program did not distinguish between users. The solution to this is
 to file the data immediately for each invoice as it is marked as
 processed.

 1. When sites do not process all uploaded invoices, problems arise when 
 the next batch of invoices is uploaded. Drug Accountability attempts to 
 match each item with items in the DRUG file (#50). The process will
 continue to add matching data to the item. If the invoices remain on the 
 system long enough an error will occur.
 
 The solution to this is to bypass the matching process on invoice data 
 that has already been uploaded.  
 
 2. Another problem this patch corrects is with the filing of monthly data
 on drug items. Monthly data was incorrectly stored for some items in 
 the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY STATS file (#58.8). This patch corrects already 
 affected entries, and restricts the erroneous filing of incorrect data 
 in the future.

Invoices.
An undefined error occurs when editing a verified invoice if the user 
changes the name of a drug and the order units are different.  This error
occurs when prompting for the Dispense Units per Order Unit.
 
When the user edits a line item and changes the drug name, the invoiced
quantity is updated in the Drug File (#50); subtracted from the invoiced 
item and added to the new item.  If the invoiced line item is not in the
Drug File (#50), an undefined error occurs when trying to subtract the
invoiced quantity.

This patch address the following problems:
 
1.      68526           Price updates into the Drug file #50 are failing 
due to current logic that both order units and dispense units between the 
matched drug and the invoice must be equal before updating. Also, the
reporting and/or representation of which drugs are about to have order
units, costs, dispense units, and/or NDCs is hard to read, not concise,
and unwanted changes are being overlooked.
 
2.      85690   Drugs that are added to pharmacy locations are initially 
setup with a minimum of information and need to be completed manually by 
the pharmacy staff. A method of notification is needed to let the 
pharmacy staff know which drugs are needing completion.
 
3.      68611   Invoice items that have a zero quantity are updating 
inventory costing for dispensing. This results in a miss-representation 
of costs being presented for statistics and being billed to third party

Problem HD129689 - Undefined error while processing invoice
--------------------------------------------------------------
During the processing of an invoice, it is possible to receive
The following message:
Undefined N1+3 DICNO Unable to Process Invoice
This error is caused by the system not properly cleaning up variables
used by the program DICN0.

The program PSAPROC7 will be modified to cleanup the variables prior
to the call to DICN0.
 
Problem HD92886 - Leading zero's in supply item description 
--------------------------------------------------------------
If a line item on an invoice is edited to be a supply item and
the supply item description starts with a numeric (Example: 16
vial dram, or 10x10 sponge) the system interprets the leading
numeric's as an internal entry number to the Drug File.  This
will cause the software to erroneously select the wrong drug.
 
Resolution HD92886 - Leading zero's in supply item description
--------------------------------------------------------------
The code has been modified to ignore the fact that the supply
item description starts with a leading numeric.
 
Problem HD68635 - Undefined error while editing invoices
--------------------------------------------------------------
In rare cases, the UPC and/or the NDC code in an invoice has
no value.  If this is the case, the software will error out
with an undefined error while editing an invoice to be verified.
 
Resolution HD68635 - Undefined error while editing invoices
--------------------------------------------------------------
The code in question will be strengthened to not error out when
this scenario occurs.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses the following problems:
 
1.  67941  PSAPROC1   undefined in PSAPROC1
If a Controlled Substance (CS) drug has not been assigned to a master 
vault, the  subsequent code path  is killing variables it will be needing 
later when it returns from the call to perform vault selection.
 
2.  68039  PSAPROC3   default date
The data element in invoices that represents the receive date, under 
terms of the McKesson contract, is the date they deposit the invoice into 
their output directories for sites to access. The default date in VistA 
DA terms had been and is, the received at site date. Management has
determined it is best to require the users to manually enter the receive 
date than to present a default date which is never correct and should not 
be accepted.
 
3.  68532  PSADRUGP   &lt;UNDEFINED&gt;DISP~PSADRUGP
The "Enter/Edit a Drug" [PSA PV DRUG ENTER/EDIT] errors when the drugs
inactivation date is less then the day of the data entry.
 
4. 131384  PSAVER2   Error using Verify Invoice [PSA VERIFY INVOICES] 
When verifying invoices, the application errors if the data in the
processed invoice contains a semicolon. 
 
5. 134108  PSAVER, PSAVER1, PSAVER4      Invoice approved twice
During Invoice Verification, multiple users are aloud to select the same
invoice and verify it.  The quantities in the DRUG file (#50) are updated 
each time the invoice is verified.
 
6.   154985     PSAVER1    Invoice not verified, but message appears
Invoices are being marked as verified at the line item level when using 
the Verify Invoices [PSA VERIFY INVOICES] option and selecting an
invoice from the &lt;&lt;&lt; EDIT INVOICES TO BE VERIFIED SCREEN &gt;&gt;&gt;

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
With the deployment of Cache version 5, it was discovered that the short
lock timeout values could generate a lock failure. Patch DI*22*147, which
has already been released, provided a solution to resolve this issue and
future lock issues.
 
This patch instituted a new default lock timeout of three seconds based on
a global node setting of ^DD("DILOCKTM")=3.
 
In order to avoid the lock issue in Drug Accountability, this patch
modifies all routines that currently use a lock timeout value of less than
3 seconds to check for the node ^DD("DILOCKTM") and to use the value
defined there, otherwise the lock timeout value is set to a default value
of 3 seconds.

This patch addresses the following problems:
 
1.  186350   DA INVOICES UNKNOW STATUS
.There are two separate issues 
  a. The invoice status remains LOCKED VERIFYING when there are errors
     in the invoice.  This LOCKED VERIFYING status does not allow any
     further action until the invoice status has been reset to PROCESSED
     or VERIFIED.
  b. When an invoice is in a LOCKED VERIFYING status, the Print Orders
     report shows the status as UNKNOWN.
 
2.  187185   Can only verify one invoice at a time after PSA*3*60
 When using the EDIT INVOICES TO BE VERIFIED SCREEN and the user selects
 multiple invoices to edit, the application quits after editing the first

This patch addresses the following problems:
 
1.  68175  PSAENTO    Time Out Issue
User reported that the "Set Up/Edit a Pharmacy Location" [PSALOCATION 
EDIT] option does not quit properly when the application times out at
the INPATIENT SITE NAME prompt.
 
2.  98252  PSAVERA    Daily Activity Log does not record change on CS 
invoice 
When using the "Edit Verified Invoices" [PSA EDIT VERIFIED INVOICE] 
option, the application does not remove the correct quantity which
results in inaccurate quantities being recorded. 
 
3. 119930  PSAPROC4   Multiple NDC match selection needs DUOU displayed
When using the "Process Uploaded Prime Vendor Invoice Data" [PSA PROCESS 
PRIME VENDOR DATA] option, the user is presented a list of drugs and 
related information if there is multiple synonyms exist. Currently the 
Dose Unit Order Unit (DUOU) is not displayed in that information.  The 
lack of this informationcan result in the wrong drug being selected 
during invoice processing.
 
4. 191994  PSAVERA   Duplicate receipt issue
When using the Edit Verified Invoices [PSA EDIT VERIFIED INVOICE] option 
to edit an invoice that has not been verified, the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY
TRANSACTION file (#58.81) is updated.  Then when the user verifies the 
invoice the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSACTION file (#58.81) is updated 
again causing duplicate transactions for the invoice item(s) that the 
edit was done on.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch modifies the screens within the processing and verification
processes within Drug Accountability. Additional drug information is
now being included in the invoice files received from the prime vendor.
 
The additional fields are:
 Generic Description
 Item Description
 Prime Vendor Units (i.e. # bottles in sell unit)
 Inner Pack   (i.e. # pills in bottle)
 
Currently, the Item Description and the inner pack fields are stored in
a temporary global which was setup in patch PSA*3*54. This global is no
longer used. The addition of the four fields is intended to assist the
user with the matching of incoming invoice items to the Drug (#50) file.
Below is an example of what the screens look like prior to installation
of this patch.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The FY08 Q4 Enhancement Release includes the following enhancement in the
Drug Accountability V. 3.0 application.
 
A new module is being added to the Drug Accountability application to 
address one of the findings in the GAO Report GAO-04-755 dated July 2004
related to implementing a better control over Return Drug Credits. The new
module is called Return Drug Credit Menu and contains the following 4
options.
 
    1      Batch Work List            [PSA RET DRG BATCH WORKLIST]
    2      Batch Complete List        [PSA RET DRG BAT COMPLETE LIST]
    3      View/Update Batch          [PSA RET DRG VIEW/UPDATE BATCH]
    4      Return Drug Credit Report  [PSA RET DRG REPORT]
 
The Batch Work List [PSA RET DRG BATCH WORKLIST] option will be used to
process open return batches, which are assigned a statuses of 'AWAITING
PICKUP' and 'PICKED UP'.
 
The Batch Complete List [PSA RET DRG BAT COMPLETE LIST] option allows 
users to access and update batches with any status.
 
The View/Update Batch [PSA RET DRG VIEW/UPDATE BATCH] option is used for
single batch processing, independent of its status.
 
The Return Drug Credit Report [PSA RET DRG REPORT] option provides
the users with summary and detailed reports of all return batches.
 
Security Keys:
-------------
In order to have access to the new options, a user must have the PSORPH
or PSARET security key. The PSORPH key is an existing key in the
Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 application. The PSARET is a new security key
in the Drug Accountability application, will be transported in this patch
and should be assigned to users who will be responsible for returning
drugs to the contractor.
 
New Files:
---------
The following two new files are being added to the Drug Accountability
V. 3.0 application to support the functionality delivered by this patch.
 
 
                                UP    SEND  DATA                USER
                                DATE  SEC.  COMES   SITE  RSLV  OVER
FILE #  FILE NAME               DD    CODE  W/FILE  DATA  PTRS  RIDE
--------------------------------------------------------------------
58.35   RETURN DRUG             YES   YES   NO
58.36   RETURN DRUG CONTRACTOR  YES   YES   NO
 
 
The RETURN DRUG file (#58.35) is used to store all the information
about drugs being returned to the manufacturer while the RETURN DRUG
CONTRACTOR file (#58.36) is used to store the list of contractors
that the VA Medical Center (VAMC) uses for returning drugs for credit.
Most likely there will be only one contract active at a time for most,
if not all, VAMCs.

This patch addresses the following problems:
 
1.  HD211457 - Locked Invoice
 Sites are reporting that the invoices are being left in a LOCK
 VERIFYING status.
 
2.  HD285500 - Can't received drug (CS) into vault
 When a invoice was downloaded and processed by a tech, the quantity
 received was changed to 0 on one item because it was going to be
 sent back.  This was a mistake. It should be received in and then out.
 Then the verifier did the verification and changed the qty received to
 reflect the original qty received - correcting the mistake.
 After verifying the invoice, the user checked the Controlled Substance
 package and found the drug did not show as being received.
  
3.  HD322644 - Run away PSA IV ALL LOCATIONS - All Location Dispense/Purge
 The PSA IV ALL LOCATIONS - All Location Dispense/Purge nightly job does

 When processing a invoice with a blank ORDER UNIT the system returns a
 zero and does not generate a discrepancy report.
