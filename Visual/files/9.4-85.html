<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 
1.  When extracting the PDX*MAS data segment, all data pertaining to the
    patient's PERIOD OF SERVICE was not able to upload using the LD or LF
    of the LOAD/EDIT.  Routine VAQDBII1 has been modified to correct this
    problem.  This was reported in NOIS CAN-0595-10112.
 
 
IMPORTANT NOTICE:
=================
Once installation of this patch is complete, should your site continue to
receive Second/Third Period of Service errors, patient data will have to
be re-Requested/Unsolicited.  This is due to the Period of Service fields
having a value of null when transmitted.  Routine has been properly
corrected to include a 'Yes' or 'No' value when transmission occurs.
 
 
ROUTINE SUMMARY:
================
Below is the routine included in this patch.  The second line of this
routine will look like:

       INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
       ==========================
       1.  This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation
       will take less than 5 minutes.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE
       option on the PackMan menu.  This option will load the KIDS package
       onto your system.
 
       2.  Review your mapped set.  If any of the routines listed in the
       ROUTINE SUMMARY section are mapped, they should be removed from the
       mapped set at this time.
 
       3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu,
       Select the Installation menu.
 
       4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter VAQ*1.5*24):
                                              ==========
 
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
 
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
       installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines, DDs,
       templates, etc.).
 
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
       you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
       transport global.
 
 
 
       5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
       VAQ*1.5*24
       ==========
 
       6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
       and Protocols?  YES//', respond YES.  When prompted to select the
                                       ===
       options you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
 
 
                        VAQ (MENU) MAIN       Patient Data Exchange
                        ===============
 
       7.  MSM sites:  Please ensure you answer YES when asked if you want
       to move the routines to other systems and indicated the appropriate
       CPUs.
 
       8.  If routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
       returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
       completion.

        Sites had reported that PDX is generating error
    messages because of unable to find the correct
    Domain name from the Domain file.  The problem that
    is causing this is that the pointer is using B
    cross reference.  Routines are modified to point at
    C cross reference.

This patch stops PDX from locking file 394.61 when $$NEWTRAN^VAQFILE is
called to add a new record to the file.  ^DIC provides the appropriate
locking, so PDX doesn't have to.
 
NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity
is at a minimum.  It requires patch VAQ*1.5*28.

Patch VAQ*1.5*31
 
NOIS ISL-1198-52170
Test Site: Oklahoma City

This patch enables PDX to recognize and report on NKA (No Known Allergy)
when using the API EN1^GMRADPT, provided by the Adverse Reaction Tracking
package.

Adverse Reaction Tracking released a patch, GMRA*4*10, which changed the
data returned by EN1^GMRADPT if the patient has NKA.

Before the patch, the API returned:
GMRAL=0
GMRAL(&lt;ptr to file 120.8&gt;)=DFN_"^NKA^0^1"

After the patch, the API returned:
GMRAL=0

PDX used to grab "NKA" from the GMRAL array.  After GMRA*4*10, there was
nothing to grab.  This patch, VAQ*1.5*31, ensures that PDX recognizes that
GMRAL=0 means "NKA".

is at a minimum.  It has no patch pre-requisite requirement.

This patch prevents the sending of PDX messages to closed domains in two
ways.

1. Prevents the addition of closed domains to outgoing groups:
Screens are placed on 2 fields in the REMOTE FACILITY multiple
in file 394.83, VAQ - OUTGOING GROUP.  The fields are .01 REMOTE FACILITY
and .02 REMOTE DOMAIN.  For both of these, the DOMAIN file is checked
to ensure that the domain is not closed.  If it is, the screen fails
and you are prevented from adding the remote facility to the outgoing group.

2. Removes closed domains from outgoing groups:
When PDX messages to outgoing groups are being built, the DOMAIN file is
checked to ensure that the domain is not closed.  If it is, the remote
facility is deleted from the outgoing group, and the PDX message is not
sent to that domain.
 
NOTE: This patch should be installed during off hours, when user activity

Patch VAQ*1.5*34
 
NOIS BIR-1101-31486
Test Site: Birmingham, AL

Patch VAQ*1.5*30 exposed a problem which was not caught during its
extensive testing period.  It was not caught until it was released.
We're very sorry about that.

It is evidenced by the following:

&gt;D ^%G

Global ^VAT(394.86
        VAT(394.86
^VAT(394.86,0) = VAQ - AUTO-NUMBERING^394.86^1^1
^VAT(394.86,1,0) = 1
^VAT(394.86,1,1) = 390
^VAT(394.86,1,2) = "1"  &lt;----- corrupted
^VAT(394.86,1,3) = 8
^VAT(394.86,"B",1,1) = 

and by:

Global ^VAT(394.62,466
        VAT(394.62,466
^VAT(394.62,466,0) = "1"  &lt;----- corrupted
  ...
^VAT(394.62,"B","""1""",466) =  &lt;----- corrupted

This patch fixes that, and cleans up the corruption in file 394.86.
It can't fix PDXs which were adversely affected.  It can't fix file 394.62.
The PDXs will have to be resent, or the data entered manually, if necessary.

This patch checks PDX requests from remote sites to ensure that the remote
site is not flagged as Closed in the Domain file.  If the Domain file shows
that the site is closed, then the request is ignored, the message is
deleted from the server basket, and a message is sent to the members of the
group G.VAQ PDX ERRORS to inform them of this.

when attempting to Load/Edit PDX Transactions based on patient name.
This patch fixes that.

Patch VAQ*1.5*39
 
NOIS TNV-0902-30675 (Remedy Ticket HD8627/CHG2933)
Test Sites: Tennessee Valley HCS

Duplicate transaction numbers in file VAQ - TRANSACTION (#394.61) continue
to be a problem.  The pre-init for this patch deletes the triggers on the
TRANSACTION NUMBER (#.01) field in file VAQ - TRANSACTION (#394.61) and
DATA (#.01) field in file VAQ - DATA (#394.62).  These triggers are
unnecessary and are probably the cause of the problems.  After the patch
is installed, duplicate transaction numbers should no longer be created.
Feel free to delete the pre-init, ^VAQPRE39, after installation.

is at a minimum.  It has no patch prerequisite.
