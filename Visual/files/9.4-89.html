<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 This option has been modified to reduce the amount of indirection calls
 utilized in build the FOREIGN FACILTIY XREF File (#1020.2). Test sites
 for this patch have concluded that the new method reduces the time to

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 This patch corrects a problem of when more than one patient's information 
 was requested in the Display Visits to other Facilities
 [PPP DISPLAY FOREIGN VISITS] option. 
 
 A temporary global was still intact after each patient which would 
 display the previous patient's data along with the current patient.  
 
 This also contributed to the problem of more than one patients' data 
 being returned on the PPP -Medication Profiles. Warning messages are 
 now displayed indicating if there are any differences in the patient's 
 profile.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Patch 8 had a routine that was looking into the wrong file for a new
domain name.
Also, the new look-up to get a station number from the PPP DOMAIN XREF
file (#1020.8), does not accept entries that have changed their station
numbers. Since this file is a pointer to the INSTITUTIONN file (#4), the
non-dinummed entries can not be located. Therefore we are changing the call
back to the INSTITUTION file (#4).

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;17 SEQ #19</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;1998-12-14 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 Patch PPP*1*11 which reduced the amount of time it takes to extract the
 CD-ROM patient data and build the PPP FOREIGN FACILITY X-REF file 
 (#1020.2),  did not allow non-domain associated entries, therefore, when
 the PPP EDIT DOMAIN [Edit Unresolved Domain Entries] option is executed,
 no entries can be found.
 
 This patch to that process will allow the entries without an associated
 domain to be entered into the file.
 
 A new field has been added to the PPP DOMAIN XREF file (#1020.8), this
 field is called STATION NUMBER (#12). Currently the STATION field (.01)
 within this file is a pointer to the INSTITUTION file (#4). With the
 entries in the INSTITUTION file being changed sometimes, this new field
 will be the basis for collecting the proper data from the CD-ROM.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch provides more information to the error messages sent to
the user informing them of missing information about patients.
 
Also, the date of the last build is now stored in the PPP Parameter file
(#1020.1), and a call to EN^DIQ1 was added to the functionality of routine
PPPGET1.
 
Problems with the purge option not running to completion have been 
re-programmed to execute faster. The previous use of Fileman deletion
of entries for 300,000 plus patients took too much system time.
 
20JAN99 - the routine PPPGET3 had a coding mistake in it, that asked
for a code check to be done if the value of the variable was null. The
check should have been in place to check if the variable was NOT null.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1). Currently there are problems being reported with facilities trying 
to create the FOREIGN FACILITY CROSS REFERENCE file (#1020.2). The 
problem cannot be traced to either Pharmacy Prescription Practices or 
Minimal Patient Dataset. The current process of extracting the Pharmacy 
Prescription Practices data from the Minimal Patient Dataset CD-ROM 
consists of transmitting all the selected social security numbers to the 
CD-ROM, and then waiting for the visit data on each to be re-collected by
the PPP program before the file can be built. 
 
The new method will transmit several hundred entries at a time. In this 
manner, File #1020.2, can be built a little at a time. 
 
2). When a new patient is entered, a MUMPS cross-reference is 
executed which calls a PPP routine that adds the patient to PPP. 
PPP then tries to find any visits to other facilities by trying to access 
the MPD CD-ROM. If access cannot be obtained, an error bulletin is 
generated. 
 
Since the Prescription Practices Daily Batch Routine [PPP BATCH] option 
is scheduled to run nightly to gather new patient data, the action taken 
by the SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (#.09) field's cross-reference is not 
needed.

 Patch XM*7.1*51 restructured some domain names to XXX.DOMAIN.EXT for

 domain name, a null subscript error occurs at line PDXDDX+34.
 
 To correct this problem, additional checks have been added to ensure
 a correct domain entry is located.

<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 The Pharmacy Prescription Practices (PPP) software relies on patient
 visit information provided quarterly by the Minimal Patient Dataset
 (MPD) CD-ROM. This CD is no longer distributed to facilities.
 To ensure the continuing functionality of PPP, the method of acquiring
 patient visit history information must be changed. This enhancement
 updates the PPP software to use the Master Patient Index/Patient
 Demographics (MPI/PD) package files as the source of data. 
 The MPI/PD package stores the same information required by PPP in the
 TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
The FY09 Q4 Enhancement Release includes the retirement of the Pharmacy
Prescription Practices (PPP) V. 1.0 package. This is a follow-up patch for
the nationally released patch PPP*1*43 to resolve Patient Safety Issue
PSI-07-114. Per PSI-07-114, the PPP package does not provide the most
recent and up-to-date data on prescriptions from other sites. Patch
PPP*1*43 made the PPP options unavailable by marking them as 'Out of
Order'. This patch, PPP*1*44, will remove every component (see list below)
of the PPP package from sites.
 
1. The following PPP options will be removed.
    PPP (EDIT) PARAMETER                PPP MAIN
    PPP BACKGROUND PURGE LOGFILE        PPP MERGED SITE EDIT
    PPP BACKGROUND PURGE XREF           PPP PRINT CLINIC PROFILES

    PPP BUILD FFX                       PPP PRINT LOG
    PPP DISPLAY FOREIGN VISITS          PPP PRINT STATISTICS
    PPP EDIT DOMAIN                     PPP PURGE LOGFILE
    PPP EDIT FFX                        PPP PURGE LOGFILE MENU
    PPP INIT PURGE LOGFILE JOB          PPP PURGE XREF MENU
    PPP INIT PURGE XREF JOB             PPP XREF PURGE
    PPP INIT STAT
 
2. The PPP input template, PPP EDIT FILE, will be removed.
 
3. The PPP sort template, PPP LOGS, will be removed.
 
4. The following PPP list templates will be removed.
    PPP FFX DISPLAY    PPP LOG DISPL   PPP PROFILE           PPP VISITS
    PPP FFX REPORTS    PPP PRINT       PPP UNRESOLVED DOM    PPP XREF EDIT
 
5. The following PPP print templates will be removed.
    PPP CODE LIST      PPP LOGP
    PPP LOG            PPPSTAP
 
6. The following PPP protocols will be removed.
    PPP (MENU) DOM      PPP ADD FF ENTRY    PPP DEL FF ENTRY  PPP EDIT FF ENTRY
    PPP (MENU) FF XREF  PPP CHANGE ALL DOM  PPP DISPL BOTH
    PPP (MENU) VISITS   PPP CHANGE DOM      PPP DISPL OTHER
 
7. The PPP security key, PPP UTIL, will be removed.
 
8. All PPP standard routines will be removed. If after the patch is installed
   there are still routines starting with PPP then the site will be
   responsible for reviewing and deleting those routines.
 
9. The following PPP files and data will be removed.
    PPP PARAMETER File #1020.1              PPP EXCLUSION File #1020.5
    PPP CONVERSION SITE File #1020.128      PPP CODE File #1020.6
    PPP FOREIGN FACILITY XREF File #1020.2  PPP NEW SSN File #1020.7
    PPP STATISTIC File #1020.3              PPP DOMAIN XREF File #1020.8
    PPP LOG File #1020.4
 
10. A background job will be tasked when the patch is installed to remove
    the PPP files and data. Upon completion of the job, a MailMan message
    with the subject "PPP Package Data &amp; Data Dictionary Removal" is
    generated showing a list of files that were deleted. If there are
    routines that begin with PPP that were not removed, then they will be
    listed in the message. These routines will need to be reviewed by IRM
    to determine if they should be removed.
