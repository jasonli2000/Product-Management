<td>DESCRIPTION</td>
<td><pre>
The Dental package captures data on all sittings (Dental treatments)
performed in the Dental Service.  It also captures data on Dental fee
basis patients, applications for care and on days worked by Dental
Service personnel and the amount of time spent in clinical and non
clinical activities.
 
The package generates all required Dental AMIS reports and is capable of
transmitting the data to Austin, Texas through the VADATS electronic
network using Network Mailman or by magnetic tape.
 
The package also provides support for developing a treatment plan for
individual patients by determining the number of appointments needed
for each type of care to be provided and which appointments can be
scheduled concurrently or must be scheduled consecutively.
 
In addition to the AMIS reports, there is also a report to determine
which inpatients need a dental exam and one to print out sittings/visits
for one or all providers.
 
There is a separate menu for the managers of the Dental package which
allows them to set up basic files, delete erroneous entries and re-release
data to Austin that was rejected due to an error.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
DENT*1.2*30 provides the integration of the vendor Document Storage
Systems' (DSS) Dental Record Manager (DRM) product into the VistA Dental
package.  One of the conditions of the national purchase of DRM was that
the existing VEJDWPD module from DSS would be converted to the DENTV
namespace and the files ^VEJD(19600.x) would be moved to ^DENT(228.x).
The  original VEJDWPD package stored some data elements in the Dental
History  file (#19600.1) that the Database Administrator considered
duplicate data  (i.e., PCE data elements).  A post-init will move the
Dental History file to file# 228.1 and will remove those data elements in
the process (required as a  condition for the national purchase).

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;33 SEQ #30</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2001-12-10 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Patch ICD*18.0*2 was released 11/2/2001.  That patch inactivated several ICD9
codes used in the dental DENTAL CPT CODE MAPPING file (#228).  That file has a
list of CPT procedures used in the dental DSS DRM application.  Those
procedures have a default diagnosis associated with each procedure.
 
This patch consists of file 228 and a post-init routine.
 
It exports the file DENTAL CPT CODE MAPPING (#228) with updated diagnosis
codes.  Specifically, there were 244 CDT3 codes mapped to diagnosis codes
521.0 or 525.1 which were inactivated by the ICD*18*2 patch as of Oct 1, 2001
    ICD9 code 521.0 will be remapped to 521.00
    ICD9 code 525.1 will be remapped to 525.10
 
The post-init will check three things:
 
1. It checks to see if all nationally export ADA codes are indeed in file
   228.  A few sites have reported that one or two codes were not in their
   file 228 even though it was exported.
 
2. The GUI option context, DENTV DSS DRM GUI, has the list of all the RPCs
   that the DRM GUI may execute.  A few sites have reported that one or two
   RPCs are not in the option even though they were exported.  The post-init
   will ensure that all required RPCs are part of the option.
 
3. Because of the problem caused by ICD*18.0*2, the post-init will check
   every CPT and ICD9 code in file 228 (both national codes and locally added
   codes) for any problems.  A report will be displayed detailing any
   problems found.
 
4. You will find any of these pertinent messages in the installation after
   the line:   Running Post-Install Routine: POST^DENTVIP1.

<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2001-12-10 00:00:00</dt>

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 I.   v3.0 of the dentalmrm.exe switched two service conditions:
      environmental contaminants (or Persian Gulf) and ionizing radiation.
      Thus patients with these conditions ended up having action required
      in PCE.
 
 II.  There was a problem with filing administrative times.  Some sites
      would get the message unable to create record.  When the call to
      UPDATE^DIE was made to create a record in file 226, the Fileman call
      failed if there were any required identifiers on fields .3,.4,.6,.9
 
 III. If DENT*1.2*30 was installed in an account which did not have a
      previous version of DRM (VEJDWPD versions), then the multiple field
      19600 on file 220.5 was not installed and an error message was
      recorded in the KIDS installation record.  That multiple will now
      install properly in a new account.
 
 IV.  The Excel extract option would fail occasionally.  This happened
      because the Fileman API used to retrieve data from file 228.1 would
      not always return data for all the requested fields.  This was
      especially true for a pointer field that pointed to a non-existent
      entry.  This call was modified to protect against that contingency.
      The extract will also return any pce secondary providers.
 
 V.   The retrieve dental history tab would not always return data.  The
      call would quit and return no data if Fileman indicated any error
      while retrieving data.  For example, the Dental History file has a
      pointer to the old DAS file linked to that history record.  If that
      DAS record had been deleted (i.e., a broken pointer) Fileman would
      return an error.  Even though the other 11 fields requested for that
      Dental History record had data, the call would return no data for
      that record.  Now the data for that record will be returned.  Those
      fields which encountered an error by the Fileman retrieve call will
      be shown as a null value. 
 
 VI.  All calls to retrieve data from the CPT file (#80) are required to
      use the APIs in ICPTCOD routine.  Most places we were doing that.
      But there were two times when we did a direct Fileman call to file
      81.  Those places have been replaced by using the appropriate API in
      ICPTCOD.
 
 VII. In patch DENT*1.2*30 the installer was prompted as to whether or not
      to delete the ^VEJD(19600) global.  The documentation was not accurate
      in displaying this.  This file and data global should have been deleted
      since the file was moved to file 228 [^DENT(228)].  The post-init will
      check the status of ^DIC(19600), ^DD(19600), and ^VEJD(19600) and do
      any appropriate cleanup to remove these entries.
 
 VIII. Dentalmrm.exe (v3.03) is exported as part of this patch.
       You can verify the version of the dentalmrm.exe from the Help/About
       option on the menu bar in the DRM GUI.
 
 IX.  This patch will work with CPRS v16 or greater

<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2003-01-23 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 I.   This is released to support the Millennium Healthcare and Benefit
      Act, Public Law 106-117 Section 20.
 
 II.  This patch, DENT*1.2*34, along with VEJDCERT RPCS 2.11 are being
      released in a single KIDS software distribution.  This patch
      contains the informational portion of DENT*1.2*34 and provides
      field personnel with instructions on how to acquire, install, and
      implement the software.
 
 III. This patch supports the entry of Head &amp; Neck Cancer for PCE
      entry when appropriate.
 
 IV.  For the Dx999 procedure codes, the mapping values to VistA DAS
      (Dental Activity System) have changed.
      A. For each code, one CTV will be mapped to DAS category
         '37-OTHER SIGNIFICANT TREATMENT'.
 
      B. These codes will now appear under the MISC tab in the DRM GUI.
 
      C. These codes will not be used for billable procedures, but,
         rather, will be used to indicate a non-billable visit. These
         codes will generate one CTV into the DAS category "Other
         Significant Procedures." The codes may be used for intermediate
         steps and all similar non-billable patient visits. 
 
      D. These mapping changes will require that practitioners select any
         code(s) NOT in the "99 Series" (D0999, D2999, D3999, D4999,
         D5899, D5999, D6199, D6999, D7999, D8999, and D9999) for
         "billable" procedures. Practitioners are advised to select the
         closest CDT code(s) outside the "99 Series" for any procedure
         that is considered "billable," and, therefore, results in
         clinical productivity related to procedures identified by the 
         CDT codes not in the "unspecified" category (the "99 Series").
 
 V.  There are two new RPCs
      DENTV DENTAL PROVIDER - returns active providers only
      DENTV USER DEFAULT DIV - returns a user's default division as
      defined in the NEW PERSON DIVISION multiple.
 
 VI. XINDEX will show the following error.  This is not a problem.  It is
      problem with the XINDEX program.  There is an outstanding NOIS
      concerning this error message.
        DENTVRP8

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;35</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2003-03-29 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 Note: several places in this patch description have items highlighted.
 The purpose of these highlights is to emphasize areas to pay particular
 attention.  These should answer possible questions or concerns that IRM
 or the installer may have.
 
 1. *****************    ATTENTION      ATTENTION     ******************
    This patch should be installed immediately after installing
    ICPT*6.0*13  If it is not, then when the user clicks on the FINISH
    button in Dental Record Manager (DRM) they may generate PCE exception
    errors.
 
    Note: the ICPT*6.0*13 patch inactivated quite a few ADA codes with an
    inactivation date of 1/1/2003.  As such, these codes will no longer
    show up in any tab within DRM.  Please see the documentation
    accompanying patch ICPT*6.0*13 for details in changes to specific
    codes.
    *********************************************************************
 
 2. This patch provides compatibility with the 2003 CPT and CDT4 codes
    A new ADA Mapping table (file 228) will be installed
    NOIS: ALB-0502-51618, FGH-0602-32626
 
 3. A pre-installation routine will perform several steps
    a. Save local CPT codes the site has added to the ADA table
    b. Delete the existing ADA table
 
 4. A post-installation routine will perform several steps
    a. Verify that all CPT codes in the dental provider's quick list are
       still active.  If not, delete that code from the quick list
 
    b. Restore any locally added CPT codes to the ADA table unless that
       code is exported nationally with this patch or that code is
       inactive.
 
    c. The dental coding committee spent considerable time assigning
       default diagnosis codes to each ADA code.  As such, any changes
       the site had made to the associated default diagnosis codes will
       not be preserved.
 
 5. If the old data global, ^VEJD(19600.1), still exists, then delete it.
    A previous DENT patch had moved that data to ^DENT(228.1).
 
 6. The DENTVDD routine was modified to remove direct references to the
    ^DD global.  Supported Fileman APIs are used instead.
 
 7. A new routine is exported, DSICCPT.  This routine provides an
    interface to the CPT and ICD9 files using nationally supported APIs.
 
    **************************  PLEASE NOTE  *************************
    The Release of Information application had DSIC 1.0 (or DSIC 1.01)
    as part of that package.  This DSICCPT routine was not exported in
    those builds.  So there is no conflict between this patch and the
    Release of Information 5.0 application.  DENT*1.2*31 is to be
    released in the next couple of months and will include DSIC 1.1 which
    will include this DSICCPT routine as well as other changes.
    ******************************************************************
 
 8. A new DRM GUI executable is exported with this patch.  Changes
    include:
    a. Inactive Diagnosis codes (ICD9) will no longer be selectable in
       the search engine window.  NOIS: ASH-1201-31869, BRX-0602-12946,
       MIN-1102-40433, NHM-0202-11852, PUG-0502-52312, WIM-0902-22158
 
    b. In the Help Menu bar we have added a last broker call
       debugging tools similar to the CPRS one.
 
    c. Fixed List out of Bounds errors. This could have happened when
       typing the progress note title in the search window.  It could
       also occur occasionally when the FINISH button was clicked and
       the program was trying to file data to the Problem List.
       NOIS: BIG-0103-70399, MOU-0103-30859, MWV-0103-22436,
             PHI-0103-22339, SFC-0103-62181, UNY-0103-11934
 
    d. Fixed an Access Violation error when DRM closes out
       NOIS: ALT-0102-21002
 
    e. Printing of signed addendum notes when prompted for additional
       signers now works if the check box is selected.
 
    f. Completing a consult will now link to the proper Visit instead of
       creating a new historical Visit.
 
    g. Previous there were occasional problems if the FINISH button was
       clicked multiple times.  Now the FINISH button will ignore the
       second and subsequent clicks until the all the DRM data including
       filing of progress note has completed which may take several
       seconds.
 
    h. There is now a Excel Extract option under the Tools option on the
       Menu Bar
 
    i. Whenever a TIU note is printed within DRM, the header will have
       the words "(WORKING COPY)"
 
    j. If the DRM window is open and you change patients within CPRS,
       then the DRM window will now show itself in front of CPRS instead
       of behind it.
 
    k. Previously, in the Visit selection window pull down list, any
       entry which was longer than the width of that window would not be
       completely displayed.  Now if you hover over an entry, a hint
       will be displayed showing the entire contents.
      
 8. The following routines which supported previous patch pre- and
    post-install processes will be deleted:
    DENTVCNV, DENTVI01, DENTVI02, DENTVI03, DENTVI04, DENTVI05
 
 9. The DENTVRP3 routine was updated to bring it into complete SACC
    compliance by not doing direct reads of the ^DD global.  When
    filing ICD9 codes to the ADA table (#228) it was possible that the
    name of the ICD9 code was entered into field 1 instead of the
    pointer value to file 80.

<dt>PATCH APPLICATION HISTORY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;36</dt>
<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2003-06-28 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 1. Patch 35 exported a new ADA Table, file 228, which supported CDT4
    codes and ICPT*6.0*16 compatibility.  Each CPT mapping has 19
    associated fields.  A few of those CPT codes had incorrect values for
    some of their fields.  While reviewing that table, Dental VAHQ and
    its coding task group decided to change many other individual field
    values for quite a few CPT codes.
 
 2. The post-installation program in DENT*1.2*35 did not work as
    intended.  DRM allows the sites to add local medical codes to the
    ADA table.  DRM also allows for the sites to change the default ICD9
    mapping for a CDT code.  The post-install program was suppose to
    restore those local changes to the ADA table.  But it did not due to
    a programming bug.  This is fixed in this version.  However, this
    patch cannot put back those locally mapped CPT codes that were
    deleted with patch 35.
 
 3. Some of the CDT4 codes exported in the patch 35 ADA Mapping Table
    did not have NUM SURFACES indicated when they should have.  Thus
    user was not prompted for surfaces within the DRM GUI.
    NOIS: CHS-0403-41619
 
 4. When using Fileman on file 228.1 and entering '??' at the Select
    Dental History prompt, you may get an &lt;UNDEF&gt; error.  This was due
    to a bad Identifier on this file.
    NOIS: IND-0403-41306
 
 Technical Description
 ---------------------
 5. Changes to Data Dictionary for file 228
    A. B index changed from a traditional to a Key uniqueness index
    B. DATA TO PUT IN DENT(221) field
       1) Input transform changed to allow for CHK^DIE to be used as
          that Fileman API does not use the internal record number.
       2) Executable Help changed to allow to be invoked by Fileman
          APIs that do not require internal record number.
       3) Changed the field name from DATA TO PUT IN DENT(221) to
          DATA FOR FILE 221.
    C. PRIMARY field - a new set of codes value was entered, Either.
       This code will be used in the future
    D. FIELD FROM FILE 221 field
       1) Field type was changed from numeric to free text
       2) Input transform redone to make it more clear
       3) Output transform redone to make it more clear
    E. #SURFACES field was renamed to NUM SURFACES
    F. New field added, PREV PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS (#25).  This contains
       the default diagnosis for that CPT code in the previous version
    G. Field 1, DX ICD9, was changed to make it required
 
 6. Changes to routines (tag^routine)
    A. DENTVDD
       1) FLD4 - changed from being called by DO to being called by DO
                 with parameter passing.  For fields 19 and 34 in file
                 221, FLD4 will no longer write to the screen
       2) FLD4E - changed from being called by DO to being called by DO
                  with parameter passing.
       3) NUM - logic redone to make it more clear
       4) ID - fixed an &lt;UNDEFINED&gt; error at ID+6
               NOIS: IND-0403-41306
    B. DENTVUTL
       1) CPT - changed to call CPT^DSICCPT.  Removed the appending of
                the text '[PRIMARY]' to the CPT short description when
                the ADA table (#228) has the PRIMARY flag set for this
                CPT.
       2) CPTIEN - changed to call CPT^DSICCPT
       3) ICD - changed direct global access of data in file 81 to
                calling ICD^DSICCPT
    C. DENTVIP2 - new routine

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
1.General Information
  ========================================================================
  This patch contains fixes and enhancements to the Dental Record Manager
  (DRM) application.  This patch also contains a new M Global for DRM in
  the DENT namespace - ^DENT(228.5 for the Fee Basis enhancement.
  
  A database conversion will be run as part of the post installation.  The
  conversion fixes the dental provider number when the number starts with
  one or more zeros (as in 0494).  Because of an old cross reference on 
  the DENTAL TREATMENT file (#221), the leading zeros were dropped from 
  the provider ID number.  Only those 4 digit provider IDs whose value was
  less than 1000 were affected. The leading zeros will be replaced and any
  affected cross-references will be re-built.
  
  The patch installation process should take be less than 5 minutes.
  The post-installation conversion process may take several hours 
  depending upon the number of records in file 221 - this process will be
  tasked off.
 
 
2.SYSTEM ACCESS DURING INSTALLATION
  ========================================================================
  Installation of this patch does not require users to be off of the 
  system. However, all Dental users should not use the DRM GUI option 
  while the patch is being installed.  All Dental users MUST close any 
  open DRM GUI application prior to the patch being installed.  Once the 
  patch has completed then the users can use the DRM application.
  ********************************************************************
  *  There is a new DRM executable exported with this patch.  This   *
  *  executable MUST be deployed PRIOR to Dental users accessing the *
  *  DRM application after the patch has been installed.             *
  ********************************************************************
 
 
3.PRE-INSTALLATION PROCESS
  ========================================================================
A.A pre-install process will delete the Data Dictionaries for the 
  following file and any associated templates (INPUT, PRINT, SORT) and any
  FORMS.  No data will be deleted.  The file affected is: 228.1
B.The pre-install process will also delete field .5 from file 221.  This
  field will be reinstalled as part of the patch.  The old AF x-ref has
  been replaced with a new Trigger cross-reference to set the .4 field.
C.The temporary "ACNVT31" cross-reference on file 228.1 will be deleted. 
  This cross-reference was used in Patch 31 to keep track of which records
  needed to be converted.  
 
 
4.POST-INSTALLATION PROCESS
  ========================================================================
  The post-install routine will queue up a Taskman job to convert file 
  221.  The Provider Number field (.4) in file 221 will be converted if it
  is less than 4 characters long.  Leading zeros will be added to the 
  number (e.g. 494 will become 0494), and the affected cross-references 
  for field .4 will be re-built.
  
  ************************************************************************
  *                                                                      *
  *   THE FOLLOWING STEP BE COMPLETED FOR THIS PATCH TO WORK PROPERLY    *
  *                                                                      *
  ************************************************************************
 
  At this point, the KIDS install will have completed.  IRM needs to place
  the DRM GUI executable in the appropriate directory.  The placement of
  this DRM executable can be done at the same time the KIDS build is being
  installed.  The executable must be placed as follows where ...\ 
  indicates your UNC/path for where the current DRM v3.1.0.23
  dentalmrm.exe is located:        Move dentalmrm.exe to ...\DOCSTORE
 
 
5.FIXES TO THE DRM APPLICATION
  ========================================================================
A.Remove screening of dental patient category based on inpatient status.
  NOIS: NYH-1203-11181, TOM-1203-41027, UNY-1203-10667
 
B.Delete any inactive CPT codes on an users quick list.

C.Under certain circumstances, DRM did not honor the choice of filing 
  flags on a per CPT code basis.  Now, it will only file to PCE or DAS
  or DES if explicitly indicated.  The default is to file to all three.
  Filing to Dental History only will now display the correct date on
  the Dental History tab.
  NOIS: HOU-1203-70105
   
D.Fixed misspelling of word "immumization" to " immunization" which 
  caused a "List Index out of bounds" error when clicking on the 
  Immunization button in Clinical Record tab.  When immunizations are
  imported into a note, there will be a space and a header before the
  data.
 
E.Utilize new rpc call - ORWPS ACTIVE to import meds list into 
  the TIU Note and TIU Note Addendum.
  
F.The default date range in Import Lab Results was always using a date
  range of 180 days back, but now this button uses the user parameter
  for lab days range.
  
G.Change logic to get default division only if user has more than one
  station.  The default division will be pre-selected wherever the
  station radio button(s) are shown.  If there is only one station,
  then that station is pre-selected on the screen.
  
H.Display all messages when the "DAS record not created" error (or other
  error) is encountered.  NOIS: HVH-1203-11045, BRX-1203-11654, 
  MIA-1203-31153, NCH-1203-41248, LAH-1203-62134, UNY-0104-10313,
  HWH-0204-40857, MON-0204-50811
 
I.If the user clicks on the "Add to Quick List" button on the Search form
  and clicks cancel, any new entries will be refreshed on the screen.
 
J.Due to changes in the law, there is no longer any differentiation of 
  the types of POWs.  Therefore, CLASS IIB is no longer to be used.
 
K.Edited unsigned notes will now file correctly in DRM.
 
L.Notes and Addendums created from the Clinical Record tab will now
  word wrap correctly.  Notes will not be allowed to have a future date.
  
M.A message will be displayed after spell checking has completed.
 
6.ENHANCEMENTS TO THE DRM APPLICATION
  ========================================================================
A.Dental Fee Basis is part of this patch.  A new menu option on the DRM
  File Menu displays a screen to enter/edit/delete Fee Basis information
  for the selected dental patient.  The Fee Basis information will not be
  transmitted to Austin until the DRM HL7 enhancement has been completed,
  but reports will be available on-line in Patch 38.  The new Fee Basis
  option should not be used exclusively at this time.  Users should
  continue to use their existing Fee Basis option through VistA which
  updates file 222 - DENTAL FEE BASIS (AMIS) since that information is
  being transmitted to Austin.
B.This patch enables Dental to be billing aware for patches to be released
  in FY2004.  PCE changes supporting the billing awareness project is 
  PX*1.0*124.  The changes to these dental routines will work whether or
  not that PCE patch is installed.  The PCE patch preserves the linkage of
  diagnosis codes to a CPT code when a program invokes DATA2PCE^PXAPI such
  as the dental program.  The PCE APIs to retrieve the CPT data for a 
  VISIT were also modified to return the current diagnosis linkage for
  each CPT code.  If that PCE patch is not installed, the dental program
  will work as it always has.  The two functions affected are the filing
  of data when the FINISH button is clicked and when DRM retrieves 
  historical data.  The extract (Excel) function will be made billing
  aware in another dental patch.

<dt>DATE APPLIED:  &nbsp;&nbsp;2004-08-02 00:00:00</dt>
<dt>APPLIED BY:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="200-1.html">USER,ONE</a></dt>
<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 General Information
 ========================================================================
 This patch contains fixes and enhancements to the Dental Record Manager
 (DRM) application.  This patch also contains new M Globals for DRM in
 the DENT namespace - ^DENT(220.51 and ^DENT(220.52 to support the new 
 eight character Dental Provider Id.
 
 Three database conversions will be run as part of the post installation.
 The first conversion seeds the new fields in 228.2 for the DES Reports
 (DAS FIELD, DAS DATA) based on the ADA table.  The second conversion
 changes the DIVISION pointer in file 228.1 from a pointer to file 40.8
 to a pointer to file 4.  The DD is being sent for this field to change
 the pointers.  The final conversion removes the TIU Note pointer data
 from file 228.1.
 
 The patch installation process should take be less than 5 minutes.
 The post-installation conversion process may take several hours 
 depending upon the number of records in file 228.1 and 228.2.
 This conversion process will be tasked off in the background.
 
 
 SYSTEM ACCESS DURING INSTALLATION
 ========================================================================
 Installation of this patch does not require users to be off of the 
 system. However, all Dental users should not use the DRM GUI option 
 while the patch is being installed.  All Dental users MUST close any 
 open DRM GUI application prior to the patch being installed.  Once the 
 patch has completed the users can use the DRM application.  Until
 the conversions are complete, the new DRM reports may not give accurate
 results since they need the new DAS FIELD and DAS DATA data in file
 228.2, and they search for data based on the DIVISION field which is
 also being changed.
 
  ********************************************************************
  *  There is a new DRM executable exported with this patch.  This   *
  *  executable MUST be deployed PRIOR to Dental users accessing the *
  *  DRM application after the patch has been installed.             *
  ********************************************************************
 
 
 PRE-INSTALLATION PROCESS
 ========================================================================
 The pre-install process will delete field .18(DIVISION) from file 228.1.
 This field will be reinstalled as part of the patch.
 
 The pre-install process will delete the TIU Note pointer from file 228.1.
 This field is no longer used.
 
 The pre-install process will also delete field .16(SURFACE) and 1.18
 (TEMP TRANS ID) from file 228.2.  These fields will be reinstalled as
 SURFACES/ROOTS and HL7 STATUS, respectively.
 
 
 POST-INSTALLATION PROCESS
 ========================================================================
 The post-install routine will queue up a Taskman job to convert files 
 228.1, (division pointer and removing any TIU Note pointer data) and 
 228.2, (setting DES reporting fields).  It will also create a new index
 on file 228.1 for DES reporting ("AG") and re-index the "AF" cross-ref
 on file 228.1.
  
  ***********************************************************************
  *                                                                     *
  *   THE FOLLOWING STEP BE COMPLETED FOR THIS PATCH TO WORK PROPERLY   *
  *                                                                     *
  ***********************************************************************
 
 At this point, the KIDS install will have completed.  IRM needs to place
 the DRM GUI executable in the appropriate directory.  The placement of
 this DRM executable can be done at the same time the KIDS build is being
 installed.  The executable must be placed as follows where ...\ 
 indicates your UNC/path for where the current DRM v3.11
 dentalmrm.exe is located:        
        Move dentalmrm.exe to ...\DOCSTORE
 Also... the new extract executable needs to be placed in the
 same directory where dentalmrm.exe resides.
        Move DRMEXTSRV.ext to ...\DOCSTORE
 
 
 FIXES TO THE DRM APPLICATION
 ========================================================================
 A. The list of Visits that display when the user wants to Delete a 
    Dental Encounter will now display in reverse chronological order with
    no duplicates.
     
 B. The information on the Dental History tab will display in reverse
    chronological order by date/time, not just date.
     
 C. If there are no Vital signs to be imported, an extra linefeed was
    appearing in the note - the extra linefeed has been removed.
  
 D. Change the .18 field (DIVISION) in the DENTAL HISTORY file (#228.1)
    From a pointer to file 40.8 (MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION) to a pointer to
    file 4 (INSTITUTION).  
 
 F. Add fields DAS FIELD, DAS DATA to the TREATMENT PLAN TRANSACTION/EXAM
    file (#228.2).  These fields will be seeded with data during the post
    install conversion.  These fields, along with the CTV, VA-DSS GROUP
    fields will be set appropriately when transactions are filed.
    Most of these fields are used in DES Reports.
     
 G. A Fileman error was occurring when entering single letter look-ups
    (e.g., "B") in the Provider lookup screen.  This screen is displayed
    when clicking the New button on the Provider Edit screen, or
    when selecting the optional Provider checkbox on the Extract screen,
    or when selecting to file an encounter under another provider's
    name.  The error has been fixed.  This type of error was also
    occurring on the User lookup screens (User Inquiry and user selection
    within the Administrator Toolbox), and was also fixed.
     
 H. CPT code search was returning D2950 when the code D2951 was entered.
    This has been fixed.
     
 I. The word 'Extract' was spelled incorrectly on the old Extract History
    Data screen.  It's now correct.
     
 J. Consults were not being completed when the user Double-Clicked them,
    only when the consult was single-clicked.  Now they will complete
    either way.  NOIS: MIA-0304-30860
 
 K. Change the field definition for field 1.18 in the TREATMENT PLAN 
    TRANSACTION/EXAM file (#228.2).  This field was not used, and will
    now store the HL7 transmission status.
 
 L. A new field called TP RECORD (.06) was added to the TREATMENT PLAN
    TRANSACTION/EXAM file (#228.2).  The field will be set to 1 for
    Treatment Plan (DRM+) transactions to differentiate them from DRM.
    
 M. A new field called TREATMENT FLAGS (1.202) was added to the TREATMENT
    PLAN TRANSACTION/EXAM file (#228.2).  The field will be contain the
    tooth-related flag.
 
 N. The SURFACES (.16) field in the TREATMENT PLAN TRANSACTION/EXAM file
    (#228.2) was renamed to SURFACES/ROOTS and the field definition now
    allows 1-7 characters (upper/lower) vs only uppercase characters.
 
 
 ENHANCEMENTS TO THE DRM APPLICATION
 ========================================================================
 A. DES Reports are part of this patch.  This enhancement provides six 
    dental reports for the local VistA system.  The reports are:
    Provider Summary, Clinic Summary, Sittings by Provider, Individual
    Sittings, Non-Clinical Time Report, Dental Fee Basis Report.  These
    reports are similar to DAS reports of the same name.  Reports are 
    available on the Tools menu for all users.
    
 B. Provider Add/Edit is part of this patch.  This enhancement allows the
    dental administrator to add or edit the dental staff in the DENTAL
    PROVIDER (#220.5) file.  A new eight character Dental Provider Id has
    been created and will be used in the DES Reports.  The old four
    character Dental Provider Id is still required for DAS, but will be
    deprecated when DAS is replaced.  Provider Add/Edit is available on
    the Tools menu for administrative users.
    
 C. A new Extract History data option is available on the Tools menu.
    This option does not use RPC calls to get history data, but uses
    instead, a TCP/IP process running on the local machine.  When the
    user wants to run the new extract, a process will start in the
    user's system tray and will wait for data from Vista.  When the data
    has been sent, the Vista M code will send a Shutdown message to stop
    the TCP/IP server.  During the patch testing phase for Patch 38, the
    old Extract option will remain enabled along with the new Extract
    option.  NOTE!  Users will have to contact IRM to get a valid Port#
    to be used with the extract!  The user must also know the IP address
    of their workstation in order for the Vista M code to correctly
    connect to the TCP/IP process running on their machine!  These
    parameters will be stored on Vista and can be edited/viewed via the
    Parameters button on the new Extract History Data screen.
 
 D. Fee Basis and Dental Transaction records will start setting the
    "AXMIT" cross-reference correctly ("P" for pending, "C" for canceled)
    in preparation for transmitting HL7 records to AAC.

General Information
========================================================================
This patch contains the enhancement to send the Dental Encounter and 
Dental Fee Basis data to the Austin Automation Center (AAC) via an HL7 
interface.  It also contains enhancements to the  Dental Record Manager 
(DRM) application.
 
The patch installation process should take be less than 5 minutes.
 
SYSTEM ACCESS DURING INSTALLATION
=========================================================================
Installation of this patch does not require users to be off of the system.
However, if your site is not a DRM Plus (patch 39) site, then the 
following instructions apply: Dental users should not use the DRM GUI 
application while the patch is being installed: all Dental users MUST 
close any open DRM GUI application prior to the patch being installed: 
Once the patch has completed the users can use
the DRM application.
 
  ********************************************************************
  *  There is a new DRM executable exported with this patch.  This   *
  *  executable is only for DRM sites (not DRM Plus sites!) and MUST *
  * be deployed PRIOR to Dental users accessing the DRM application  *
  * after the patch has been installed.                              *
  ********************************************************************
 
FIXES TO THE DRM APPLICATION
========================================================================
A.  When transactions are filed only to the History file and not to  DAS,
    the system will now file the DAS Disposition in the Dental History 
    (#228.1) file correctly.  This field contains the 'in progress', 
    'completed' or 'terminated' flag.  The system will also correctly
    file the Create Date in this case.
B.  Billing awareness changes were made for the procedure/diagnosis 
   data being sent to PCE.
 
ENHANCEMENTS TO THE DRM APPLICATION
========================================================================
 
 A. Dental Encounter (DES) and Dental Fee Basis data will be transmitted 
    to the Austin Automation Center (AAC) via HL7 compliant messages. HL7
    messages will be combined into batches that are compiled weekly and 
    sent to the AAC using the Vista interface engine.  Batches are 
    limited to 1000 HL7 msgs. There are at least two batches being sent
    from the local sites, one containing Dental Encounter data and one 
    for Dental Fee Basis data. The data transfer will be initialized 
    through a weekly queued option. The site no longer has to manually 
    start the transmission to the AAC as they did for the Dental Activity 
    System (DAS) data.  DAS transmissions will be disabled in another
    DRM patch.
 
 B. Historical Dental Encounter data (transactions filed before DRM patch
    38 was installed) will be sent to the AAC via a CD.  An option is 
    available to create these HL7 messages and put them into a file on 
    a server. The file needs to be copied onto a CD and mailed to the 
    AAC.
 
 C. A new parameter DENTV DRM DAS TURNOFF contains a date which controls
    the filing of data to DAS (file 221).  When the date is reached, DRM
    will no longer offer the File DAS Only option and will not file any
    data to file 221 even when filing to All (DES, PCE are now the only
    filing choices).  Also, the old 4 digit Provider ID will no longer
    be required when adding/editing dental providers. The turnoff date 
    is defaulted to 10/31/2004.
 
 D. When the user looks up providers (in the Extract, Provider Add/Edit
    options, the provider list will now contain their initials and title
    to help differentiate users with the same name.
 
 E. Combat Veteran status has been added to the Service Connected
    selection page.
 
 F. The text of the filing options was changed from "File DAS/PCE..." to
    "File Data...".

=========================================================================
The post-install routine will stuff the facility ID of the installing 
site into the HL7 APPPLICATION PARAMTER file for the two parameters being 
sent with the package.  It will also set the DAS turnoff date in the
new parameter DENTV DRM DAS TURNOFF to 10/31.2004.
 
The post-install will also re-index some entries for the "AXMIT" 
cross-reference in file 228.2 (used by the HL7 interface) due to 
potential issues with the Create Date being set as a string.

5                 Set up a Historical One-Time Scheduled Task
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Dental Encounter System (DES) has been gathering data since Oct 2000 
in file 228.  Dental VAHQ would like all that data downloaded to the new 
DES database at the AAC.  The amount of data at some sites might be 
extensive.  The VIE team and Capacity Management prefer that an option be 
made available to the sites to move that data to
a CD instead of using bandwidth on the VA WAN for moving those HL7 
historical messages to the AAC.  Thus we have provided an option for the 
site to schedule at a time that is convenient for the site.
 
To estimate the size of the file that will be generated, perform a 
Fileman Inquire on file 228.2.  The number of records will give you a 
ballpark estimate as to the size of the Historical file - each  
transaction will take just under 1K when formatted as an HL7 message.  
So, a record count of 55,024 will produce a file of &lt; 55,000K or just 
under 55meg.  Not all records will be sent via the Historical batch of 
course, since all records created since the installation of DENT*1.2*38 
will be sent via the Vista Interface Engine and the weekly process.
 
NOTE: The historical CD is expected at the AAC within one month of the 
release of patch 40.
 
Here are the instructions for setting up a one-time Scheduled Task for 
the DENTVHL PROCESS HISTORIC option [menu text: Process one-time 
historical extract (Dental)].  Please note that this option will generate 
a HFS file with a name like DENTV_HISTORICAL_&lt;site#&gt;.TXT.  The file will 
be located in the directory as defined 
in your Kernel Site Parameters.  You can easily see what this value is 
from the programmer's prompt as shown in this example:
 
VAH&gt;W $$PWD^%ZISH
c:\hfs\_TO CD\
 
Once the historical option has completed, you will need to copy that file 
to a CD.  You will then mail that CD to the AAC.  If you choose to FTP 
the file from your VMS system to another network server, then please 
remember to FTP the file in ASCII (or text) mode.  Here is the mailing 
address for that CD:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
An new mail group has been added called DENTV HL7 MESSAGES.  Please add 
members to this mail group.  These should be individuals who will be 
responsible for taking action if the acknowledgement messages that come 
back from the AAC which contain error codes.  These problems need to be 
addressed in the VistA DES database.  Those transactions, once fixed, 
will need to be flagged for retransmission.  A good candidate for a 
member would be the dental administrator for DRM in the Dental Service.
 
This is an example of adding a member to this mail group.  There are 
several Kernel options that allow the adding of members to a mail group 
including using Fileman.  This example just shows one of those options'

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
 General Information
 ========================================================================
 This patch contains fixes and enhancements to the Dental Record Manager
 (DRM) application.  This patch also contains new files for DRM in the
 DENT namespace - ^DENT(228.6) which contains tooth notes and
 ^DENT(228.7) which contains reserved transactions.  The ^DENT global
 should already exist on your system so no global placement is required.
 
 A database conversion will be run as part of the post installation.
 RVU and DSS Product line data will be set into existing transactions 
 from file 228 DENTAL CPT CODE MAPPING.  New System parameters required
 for DRM Plus will be seeded with default data.
 
 **NOTE** Dental administrators are responsible for entering RVU and
 VA-DSS Product Line information into the system for *ALL* locally mapped
 medical (CPT) codes!  This information will be required for processing
 transactions that are sent to Austin after patch 40 is installed.  See
 the post-installation instructions for details on entering this
 information.
 
 The patch installation process should take be less than 5 minutes.
 The post-installation conversion process may take several hours 
 depending upon the number of records in file 228.2.  This conversion 
 process will be tasked off in the background.
 
 
ENHANCEMENTS TO THE DRM APPLICATION
 ========================================================================
 A. DRM Plus - an entirely new visually enhanced GUI is part of this 
    patch.  DRM Plus contains screens to edit Perio, PSR and Head/Neck 
    lesion data as well as the enhanced visual screens for general 
    dentistry.
 
 B. RVU data will be stored with the ADA codes and will be shipped with
    with the DENTAL CPT MAPPING table (#228).  For locally added codes, 
    users will be able to edit RVU and VA-DSS Product Line information.
   
 C. DES Reports that were created in DRM Patch 38 have been enhanced to
    allow screening of transaction status (complete, pending, deleted) 
    and patient type (active, inactive).  The Summary Reports 
    provider/clinic) now allow the user the option to print only the 
    third page totals.
    
 D. The New Extract option that was created in DRM Patch 38 has been
    enhanced to allow screening of transaction status (complete, pending,
    findings and observe).  Both Extract options have been changed to
    output RVU and transaction status data to the text file.
    
 E. Selection of patient visits now offers a new radio button to view
    only Dental Visits (and Scheduled appointments for Dental).  Dental
    Visits are those where the location has a stop code of 180 or 181.
    The Dental Visits radio button is now the default selection,
    instead of the All button.
    
 F. Combat Veteran status has been added to the Service Connected
    selection page.
    
 G. The DRM Plus application will no longer ask the user if they want to
    close the application after they have hit the close button.
 
 H. Users will no longer be prompted for # of Canals.  If the ADA code
    in the ADA Mapping table (#228) is marked for Canals, then DRM Plus
    will use that value for the transaction.
 
 I. Users have the option of saving dental information in a temporary
    workspace at any time in the DRM Plus workflow.  The user may close 
    DRM Plus or change patients and the system will prompt to save the 
    currently entered information without having to click the Finish 
    button.  When the user re-opens DRM Plus for the patient with saved
    data, the system will prompt to re-load the information and the
    user can continue through the screens.
 
 J. The user will only see active providers when selecting co-signers.
  
 SYSTEM ACCESS DURING INSTALLATION
 ========================================================================
 Installation of this patch does not require users to be off of the 
 system. However, all Dental users should not use the DRM GUI option 
 while the patch is being installed.  All Dental users MUST close any 
 open DRM GUI application prior to the patch being installed.  Once the 
 patch has completed the users can use the DRM application.
 
  ********************************************************************
  *  There is a new DRM executable exported with this patch, called  *
  *  dentalmrmtx.exe.  This executable will NOT be used until the    *
  *  site has scheduled training for DRM Plus.  The site should      *
  *  continue to use the old executable (dentalmrm.exe) against the  *
  *  the DENT*12.*39 KIDS build until that time.                     *
  *                                                                  *
  *  ** There are also new Client-side components that must be **    *
  *     installed for the new executable to work properly!!          *
  * ** Please read the post-installation instructions thoroughly! ** *
  *                                                                  *
  ********************************************************************
 
 PRE-INSTALLATION PROCESS
 ========================================================================
 The pre-install process will save off the current ADA table (file 228)
 in preparation for re-loading new ADA data. 
 
 The pre-install process will delete field 4.06 in file 228.2 because
 the DESCRIPTION field was changed to a word processing field 4.1.  If
 field .04 (PLAN NUMBER) in file 228.6 exits, it will be deleted as it
 is no longer used.
 
 
 POST-INSTALLATION PROCESS
 ========================================================================
 
 Please read the post-installation instructions which follow the
 installation instructions.  All the steps in the post-install must be
 completed for DRM Plus to function properly.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR DENT*1.2*39
 =======================================================================
 This patch must be installed when there are no dental DRM processes
 running.  All open DRM GUI applications must be closed.
 The installation time should take less than 5 minutes.
 
 1. Obtain the Dent_1_2p39.kid file
 
 2. For DSM sites review your mapped set.  Disable any of the above
    routines if necessary
 
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
    the Installation menu
 
 4. Use Load a Distribution and enter Dent_1_2p39.kid when prompted
    for a Host file.  You may need to attach a directory name
 
 5. You may elect to use the following options (when prompted for 
    INSTALL NAME, enter DENT*1.2*39)
    a. Backup a Transport Global
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global
 
 6. Use the Install Package(s) option and select package DENT*1.2*39
 
 7. For the install prompts, enter either Yes or No depending upon the
    normal practice at your facility.  This example shows answering NO:
 
     Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES// NO
                 Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// NO
 Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? YES// NO
 
 8. AXP/DSM Sites - After the patch has been installed, rebuild your map
    set, if necessary
 
 9. The post-install routine queues up a Taskman job to add RVU and 
    Product Line information into existing transactions in file 228.2.
    The post install will also add, edit or delete certain parameter 
    instances for DRM Plus and will add the locally added CPT codes back
    into file 228.
 
 POST INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 ========================================================================
  ***********************************************************************
  *  THESE STEPS SHOULD NOT BE COMPLETED UNTIL YOUR SITE IS SCHEDULED   *
  *  FOR DRM PLUS TRAINING!                                             *
  ***********************************************************************
 
 1. At this point, the KIDS install will have completed.  IRM must place
    the DRM GUI executable in the appropriate directory.  The placement
    of this DRM executable can be done at the same time the KIDS build is
    being installed.  The executable must be placed as follows where ...\ 
    indicates your UNC/path for where the current DRM v3.12 dentalmrm.exe
    is located:      Move dentalmrmtx.exe to ...\DOCSTORE
 
 2. Create a CPRS Tools menu option for this new executable
    Add the DRM Plus option to the CPRS Tools Menu with these params:
       ...\DOCSTORE\DENTALMRMTX.EXE S=%SRV P=%PORT D=%DFN TX=1
    Note that the executable name is different than the current DRM
    executable and the parameters contain a new string TX=1 which stands
    for Treatment Plan - the new GUI display.  If you do not include this
    new parameter, the Dental program will look like the existing DRM
    application and none of the new features will be available to the
    dental user.
 
 3. Client PC setup
    There are DRM Plus support files that MUST be installed on each  
    Windows client PC that will be running the DRM GUI application.
    You must have local Administrative privileges on the client PC to
    properly install these files.  See the installation steps below for
    details.
 
    a. Update the client machines (need Administrator privileges) by
       running the SETUP.EXE, VBRUN60SP6.EXE, and MDAC_TYP.EXE programs
       in that order.
 
    b. Reboot the machine and log in again as the administrator to
       complete the installation process!
 
    c. Once you have installed the three programs in step 4.a. and you
       need to reinstall this patch (or if test sites are upgrading to a
       newer version of the patch), then you only have to run the
       UPDATE.EXE file to upgrade the DRM Plus client files.
       UPDATE.EXE does not require administrator privileges.
       Keep these three client installation files for future use
       e.g. when new pcs are added to the dental clinic, etc.
 
 4. Adding or Editing Local CPT Codes
  a. This step needs to be done by the dental administrator.  This is
     not an IRM function at most sites.  This step can be completed any
     time after the patch has been installed.  This step should be
     completed before the dental users are given access to the DRM Plus
     application.  If not, then it is possible that those users will
     select these locally added CPT codes.  Since no RVUs nor VA-DSS
     Product Line values are mapped, then no dental workload will be
     transmitted to the new Dental Encounter System database in Austin
     once patch DENT*1.2*40 is released.
 
  b. The dental administrator needs to update RVU and VA-DSS Product Line
     values for any CPT codes which the site might have added to the ADA
     Mapping Table (#228).  If the site has not added any CPT codes to
     this table, then this step can be skipped.  The dental administrator
     will edit this information using the DRM Plus GUI program.
     1) In DRM Plus, select the 'Treatment &amp; Exam' menu
     2) Within this menu, select the option 'Edit CPT/DCode Field
        Values'
     3) Search for the locally added CPT codes and enter the appropriate
        values.  Click OK to file the information.

 B. The Summary Reports (Provider and Clinic) now offer the choice to
    print only the totals columns. (this is already in DRM Plus)
    
 -----DRM Plus ONLY-----
 C. Added CPRS templates to Treatment Chart progress note and Addendum
    screens.  CPRS templates are automatically displayed if linked to
    a TIU note title or embedded in the title boilerplate (applies to
    Treatment Chart and Clinical Record progress note title selection 
    screens).  NOIS:DUR-1004-31962
    
 D. There is a new "Save unfiled data" dialog prompt and functionality
    to allow changing of providers (occurs when DRM Plus is closed, a 
    patient change in CPRS occurs, and the option "Save unfiled data" 
    under the File menu is clicked).  The "Save unfiled data to another
    provider" option under the File menu was removed. 
 
 
 FIXES TO THE DRM/DRM Plus APPLICATION
 =======================================================================
 The following fixes apply to DRM and DRM Plus:
 1. One of the routines in DENT*1.2*40 was not compatible with DSM and
    caused an error trying to run.  This routine was modified to be able
    to be run on either Cache or DSM and is included in this patch so
    that all sites are running the same version of the routine.
 
 2. The Fee Basis report will display data for facilities with alpha
    characters in their id (e.g. 674A4).  NOIS: CTX-1004-72255
 
 3. The Summary Reports (Provider and Clinic) will now print the correct
    Totals number.  NOIS: LEX-1104-41679
    
 4. Fixed a bug when loading the boilerplate of a TIU title in the 
     progress note screen of the Clinical Record tab if a Consult-type 
     was selected.  The IEN of the previous note title was passed to the 
     broker call instead of the currently selected title which could 
     result in the wrong boilerplate. 
    
 -----DRM ONLY-----
 5. Leaving the 4 digit Provider Id blank for more than one provider
    will no longer give the user a 'duplicate id' error message.  (Note:
    the 4 digit Provider Id is still required to file Admin time in DRM,
    if you are using that feature.) NOIS:PUG-1104-50509
 
 -----DRM Plus ONLY-----
 6. D6999 will no longer change the graphical display in DRM Plus and
    D4211 will prompt for tooth and not quadrant.  D2940 will now paint
    the correct graphic for restoration.  D2999 and D3999 will not
    paint graphics.
 
 7. The system will now automatically display signed notes for user 
    selection in the Addendum screen. 
    
 8. Changed display of FGM values in the progress note output of Perio 
    Exams ("+" for positive values, actual value for numbers between 
    1 - 9, and "*" for values greater than 9). 
    
 9. The HL7 message generator will no longer generate invalid transaction
    messages for DRM Plus connecting bar type transactions.
 
 10. Changed the legend/symbol definition for FGM at the bottom of the 
     Perio Exam progress note output ("FGM coronal to CEJ"). 
 
 11. Allow DRM Plus to minimize if filing Problem List results in a 
     "duplicate filing" error message. 
     
 12. Duplicate Problems will no longer be filed.
 
 13. Changed the message (disclaimer) on top of the Perio Exam progress 
     note text to "This is textual display of periodontal findings, 
     please see DRM Plus for perio charting graphic."
     
 14. Automatically display the Visit selection form without having to 
     click the "..." button on the second page of the Treatment Chart 
     tab after the Next button is clicked.
     
 15. When PCE filing errors occur, the system will not try to back out
     DAS transactions since they are no longer filed.
     
 16. Correctly assign the provider initials in the transaction list
     when the user enters a bridge, connecting bar or partial.
     NOIS:MIA-1104-31314, PUG-1204-51038
     
 17. Fixed an intermittent issue with completed procedures not 
     generating a code description in the progress note.
     
 18. Corrected the translation of "Miscellaneous" material in 
     Diagnostic Findings transactions to display the text "Misc"
     in the progress note.  Because Miscellaneous is internally 
     mapped as Unknown, no material is displayed with the tooth 
     in the progress note for transactions such as existing 
     Restorations.
 
 19. The Multi Add button will now be enabled/disabled for the
     appropriate DCodes.
     
 20. Fixed a bug where 'Observe' type transactions were trying to be sent
     through the HL7 interface and generating an error.  Only Completed,
     non-observe transactions should be transmitted. NOIS: MIN-1204-40802
     
 21. Changed the order of the lower PSR values based on a request by
     the dental development group.
     
 22. Changed the link to the VA Intranet Website under Help menu to 
     http://vaww1.domain.ext/drmplus1/.  (Note: this link is outside the VA
     network firewall). 
     
 23. The progress note text width component code was updated.  The
     progress note screens: regular note, addendum, and Clinical 
     Record tab note, will wordwrap the text properly at the designated
     width (usually 74 characters wide). 
 
 24. Copyright information updated to show "1998 - 2005" in the 
     Help/About menu option. 
     
 25. Fixed the "List index out of bounds" error message when clicking 
     the Back button and changes in the text were detected with/without
     the text marker. 
 
 26. Disabled the "No" button on the save data prompt when selecting the
     "Save unfiled data" menu option. Disabled the "Cancel" button on the
     save data prompt when switching patient. 
     
 27. Replaced the "Additional Notes" section label with a dashed line 
     (60 characters wide) in the progress note. Changed the "Additional
     Notes" treeview item to "Insert Text Marker" so the user can 
     manually insert the marker in the progress note. 
     
 28. The Text Marker section marker is automatically inserted 
     when a CPRS template or TIU boilerplate is imported when the note
     title selection is presented for the first time. 
 
 29.  A warning message will be presented to the user if changes were 
      made to the progress note text and the Text Marker is not found.
      or, if changes occur above the original placement of the 
      Text Marker.
     
 30. Added a new checkbox "Default treeview display to DRM objects" in
     the User Options under the Treatment System tab.  This allows the 
     user to select which treeview display the user prefers in the 
     progress note. (DRM Objects is the default.)
 
 31. The following changes were made to the DRM Plus client component:
     a. The message "There are no appointments" which could show up in 
        some situations has been removed.
     b. Clicking on "Perio Buttons" and then clicking on a tooth will no
        longer show the ADA Codes list. 
     c. The periodontal statistics will now accurately reflect the total 
        number of sites and teeth for furcation and MGJ.  Teeth without 
        periodontal readings such as missing or denture will also be 
        accounted for correctly.
     d. Fix drawing error when adding a partial on a tooth with an 
        implant and a coping.
     e. When adding a connecting bar over missing teeth, the missing
        teeth will no longer display a hollow crown image.
     f. Bridge and partial transactions will now be added with the 
        correct provider.
     g. Problem where patient notes were being duplicated when changing
        dates and clicking "Show All" has been resolved.
     h. When adding a pontic to an implant which has a coping on it; 
        implant will be removed appropriately.
     i. Clicking Add in Multi-Add without selecting a tooth or 
        quadrant will not generate a run-time error.
     j. The default code for an extracted implant is now D6100.
     k. Probing will now be allowed on all retained roots. 
     l. Extracted roots will now display in the transaction list as 
        "Extract" when completed or planned.
     m. The ability to "Cancel" the Extract bridge dialog has been added.
     n. Notes cannot be added without first adding a transaction.
     o. Apostrophes will be stripped from the SpeedCode name in order to
        prevent a run-time error.
     p. The dentition message which tells the user to use the individual
        dentition button has been modified to be more accurate.
     q. The H&amp;N date filter now works appropriately.
     r. Sealant markers will now draw on top of cracked occlusal 
        surfaces appropriately.
     s. Defective materials will never display in treatment plan or 
        completed care.
     t. The default code for a coping on an implant has been changed 
        from D6020 to D6056.
      
 
 SYSTEM ACCESS DURING INSTALLATION
 =======================================================================
 Installation of this patch does not require users to be off of the 
 system. However, all Dental users should not use the DRM or DRM Plus 
 GUI option while the patch is being installed.  All Dental users MUST
 close any open DRM or DRM Plus GUI application prior to the patch being
 installed.  Once the patch has completed, DRM users can use the 
 application.  DRM Plus users must have a client update performed on
 their machine.
 
 POST-INSTALLATION PROCESS
 ========================================================================
 The KIDS post-install routine will do the following:
 1. Disable the DAS options listed in the Enhancements section of this
    document.  The options will be turned off by setting the Out Of Order
    Message to 'DAS turned off'.
 2. Change the Condition/Area/Material for some DCodes so that the DRM 
    Plus graphics will paint correctly.
 3. Set a new multi-add flag to DCodes to better enable/disable this DRM
    Plus feature for the appropriate DCodes.  
 4. Remove the HL7 'pending' x-ref for all Observe DRM Plus transactions.
 5. Set the new DRM Plus Treeview parameter (DENTV TP TREEVIEW DEFAULT)
    to Yes.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR DENT*1.2*42
 ======================================================================
 This patch can be installed while users are on the system.
 The installation time should take less than 1 minute.
   
 1. Obtain the Dent_1_2p42.kid file
 
 2. For DSM sites review your mapped set.  Disable any of the above
      routines if necessary.
 
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
    the Installation menu.
 
 4. Use Load a Distribution and enter Dent_1_2P42.kid when prompted
    for a Host file.  You may need to attach a directory name.
 
 5. You may elect to use the following options (when prompted for 
    INSTALL NAME, enter DENT*1.2*42)
    a. Backup a Transport Global
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global
 
 6. Use the Install Package(s) option and select package DENT*1.2*42
 
 7. For the install prompts, enter either Yes or No depending upon the
    normal practice at your facility.  This example shows answering NO:
 
     Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES// NO
                 Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// NO
 Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? YES// NO
 
 8. AXP/DSM Sites - After the patch has been installed, rebuild your 
    map set, if necessary
 
 =======================================================================
                        POST-INSTALLATION PROCESS
 =======================================================================
 
 1. If your site is running dentalmrm.exe (DRM), then
       Move dentalmrm.exe to   ...\DOCSTORE  and you are done!
      '...\' indicates your UNC/path for where DRM is located.
 
 2. If your site is running dentalmrmtx.exe (DRM Plus)
       Move dentalmrmtx.exe to   ...\DOCSTORE
      '...\' indicates your UNC/path for where DRM Plus is located.
    Run update.exe on all client machines that will launch DRM Plus (or
    all thin client servers if you are a thin client site).  Update.exe
    does not require the installed to be an administrator.
    *********************************************************************
    Please be careful to coordinate the server/client updates with each 
    other so that the dental application works properly.  You will know 
    if the server/client files are not compatible because launching DRM 
    Plus will cause approximately 30 client errors.  This also means that
    you must carefully coordinate testing the new application in the TEST
    account since you must run update.exe on a rarely used machine for 
    the dental staff to test against, as they will not be able to run the
    production side application after running the new update.exe.
    *********************************************************************
 
    These are the DRM Plus files you are currently running from patch 39:
    dentalmrmtx.exe version 4.0.0.481    dated 10/1/2004 5:44pm (server)
    update.EXE      contains CVision.ocx dated 10/1/2005 3:09pm (client)
    *setup.EXE      new client install   dated 10/1/2005 3:10pm (client)
 
    These are the new DRM Plus files from patch 42:
    dentalmrmtx.exe version 4.0.0.49     dated 1/5/2004 10:33am (server)
    update.EXE      contains CVision.ocx dated 1/4/2005 10:50am (client)
    *setup.EXE      new client install   dated 1/6/2005  9:20am (client)
 
    *you only need setup.EXE to set up a new client machine, see step 3.
 
 3. If your site is a DRM Plus site and has any new PCs, or new thin 
    client SERVERS that need to be able to run DRM Plus, then you must be
    on the VHA domain and install the following files as an administrator
    of the machine: setup.EXE, vbrun60sp6.exe, Mdac_typ.exe and REBOOT  
    the machine. 
 
    If your site is about to be trained on DRM Plus and you need to set 
    up the training room and/or dental PCs/thin client SERVERS, then the
    files in the Dent_1_2p42.zip file supercede any files you may have 
    saved from the patch 39 installation.  Check the dates above to 
    insure you are installing the correct/latest files.

 General Information
 ========================================================================
 This patch contains fixes and enhancements to the reporting features
 within Dental Record Manager.  Many new reports will now available 
 within DRM and DRM Plus, as well as enhancements to existing reports.
 
 Where appropriate, workload reports will allow sorting by the
 following categories:
     * 30 DAS Categories (Cases Complete, Cases Terminated, etc)
     * 13 ADA Categories (Diagnostic, Preventative, etc)
     * 131 DES Product Lines (Brief Exams, Extensive Exams, etc)
     * ADA/CPT Code.
     
 When the DAS Category is selected, reports display workload credit
 using CTVs.  When any of the DES categories are selected, reports
 display workload credit using RVUs.  CPT codes (non-DCodes) are now
 included in the DES category totals.
     
 The patch installation process should take be less than 5 minutes.
 
 ENHANCEMENTS TO THE DRM AND DRM PLUS APPLICATION
 ========================================================================
 A. The following new KLF-style reports are available within DRM/DRM Plus.
    These reports can retrieve data using DAS or DES type categories and
    will display the appropriate workload value (CTV or RVU).
    1: Observations per Month
    2: Service Profile
    3: Service by Product Group
    4: Provider Profile
    5: Patient Category Profile
    6: Patients by Eligibility Setting
    7: Patients by Eligibility Group
    8: Patients by Dental Patient Category
    9: Outpatient Service by Product Group
    10: Inpatient Service by Product Group
    11: Distribution of Dental Services
   
 B. The Fee Basis Report provides the capability to view detail data. 
    Detailed data contains subtotals and can be sorted by clicking on
    the header row.
    
 C. Total Sittings/Visits by Patient Type is available.  This report
    is similar to the Sittings/Visits Report within VistA/DAS reporting.
    
 D. The current Summray and Sittings reports were enhanced to use RVU vs.
     CTV, and multiple DES sort categories (ADA Category, VA-DSS 
     Products, ADA/CPT Codes) as well as the existing DAS category.  
     These reports currently retrieve data for providers with the
     new 8 digit Provider Id.  Now they will also get historical data
     for any dental provider in the system.
     
 E. The Sittings Reports (Provider/Clinic) now allow sorting by column
    heading once the report has been run.  Simply click on the column
    that you want sorted and the data will re-arrange into the correct
    sequence.  The Totals row will always remain at the end and the
    subtotals will be based on the column being sorted.
    
 F. The Extract options allow the user to select an individual site, or
    all sites.  If a single site is selected, then the providers
    displayed on the New Extract screen will be valid for the selected
    site only.
    
 G. Headers in the extract text that started with "DAS " (for example,
    DAS DIVISION) have been changed to remove the DAS designation.
    
 H. The informational text on the Delete Encounter screen within the
    Dental History tab was changed to remove all references to DAS.
 
 I. A legend box can be displayed detailing the provider type and 
    specialty codes that make up the 8 digit Provider Id on any report
    screen that contains the 8 digit provider Id.
    
 J. Provider lists on reports and the New Extract now display the
    provider type and provider specialty information next to the name.
    
 K. A new Version Information screen will pop-up for the user when a new
    version is run for the first time.  The user may select to show
    this screen the next time they launch DRM/DRM Plus.
    
 L. $Values, VA Cost to Perform and Equivalent Private Cost can be 
    entered for ADA/CPT codes by admin users.  The fields are available
    on the Edit CPT Field Values option or can be quickly edited using
    a new option called Edit Procedure Costs.  These values display on 
    various DES reports.
    
 M. Patient SSNs on the reports (Sittings, Detailed Fee Basis and the
    DRM Plus Provider Planning report) have been replaced with the
    patient name and last 4 of the SSN.
 
 DRM Plus only
 -------------
 N. Primary and Secondary Provider designations can be defined and will
    display on the header of the application next to the patient name.
    A new report Provider Planning is available to display planned 
    treatment items for the primary and secondary providers.  Admin users
    can define who can edit Primary/Secondary providers using a new
    parameter on the Security tab of the Admin Toolbox for users.
 
 
 FIXES TO THE DRM/DRM Plus APPLICATIONS
 =======================================================================
 A. Provider selection on the report screen will be based on the selected
    division.  If there is no DIVISION assigned to a Provider, then that
    provider will display under any site, otherwise the Provider will 
    only display for sites that he/she has been assigned to.  
    NOIS:PUG-1104-50338 
    
 B. The user can no longer modify (remove) the Report Date on the File
    Fee Basis screen.  This was causing a 'List Index Out Of Bounds' 
    error.  NOIS:MAD-0205-40840
 
 C. Non-Clinical Time no longer requires the 4 digit Provider Id to file
    time.  The report will still show data for those providers with only
    a 4 digit Id (historical data), but it will use the 8 digit Id if
    there is one.  Non-Clinical time can be entered by non-dentist users
    in the Education and Research categories.
  
 D. Transactions for partials will send Tooth# in the HL7 message to the
    AAC for research purposes.
  
 DRM Plus only:
 --------------
 E. Head and Neck, PSR and Perio data can be filed for providers without
    a 4 digit Provider Id.  Only the 8 digit Id is now required.
    
 F. If all transactions for an encounter are deleted through the 
    transaction table, then the associated encounter will also be
    deleted.
    
 G. If a speed code becomes corrupted, the site (IRM) can now delete it 
    using the DENTV XPAR EDIT PARAMS option in VistA. NOIS:PUG-0105-51270
    
 H. Existing Tooth Notes and Head and Neck data will be inserted into the
    progress note when the corresponding tree item is dbl-clicked.
 
 I. Three consecutive dashes in the progress note for PSR and Perio have
    been replaced with '- -' or '-~-' so that the note no longer has
    conflicts with TIU transcription placeholders. NOIS:WWW-0205-50264
    
 J. Teeth will be displayed in tooth# order for Findings in the progress
    note (example: Missing Teeth: 4, 7, 10, 12.) rather than in the order
    the user enters them.
 
 K. Exiting or changing patients in DRM Plus while on the perio screen
    correctly prompts to save unfiled data.

 SYSTEM ACCESS DURING INSTALLATION
 =======================================================================
 Installation of this patch does not require users to be off of the 
 system.  However, all Dental users should not use the DRM GUI option 
 while the patch is being installed.  All Dental users MUST close any 
 open DRM GUI application prior to the patch being installed.  Once the 
 patch has completed the users can use the DRM application.
  
 
 POST-INSTALLATION PROCESS
 =======================================================================
 The post-install routine will remove inactivated ICD-9's and add new
 ICD-9 codes to the DENTAL CPT CODE MAPPING (#228) table.  If the site 
 manually changed other ICD-9's that are now inactive and the patch made
 changes to those codes, then a mailman message will be sent to the users
 in the DENTV ADA CODE MAPPING mail group to verify those changes.

 General Information
 ========================================================================
 This patch contains fixes and enhancements to Dental Record Manager
 Plus including capturing the Distributed (Attending) Provider when
 residents file data to PCE, processing for potential duplicates between
 planned and completed care and a new cover page with demographic and 
 recent dental activity data.
 
 The patch installation process should take be less than 2 minutes.
  
 ENHANCEMENTS TO THE DRM PLUS APPLICATION
 ========================================================================
 A. Residents are required to enter a "Distributed" (Attending) Provider 
    when filing data to PCE. The Distributed Provider will become the 
    PCE Primary Provider for the encounter and will be sent to the 
    national database for reporting.  All local DRM Plus reports will
    continue to count workload toward the resident.  The Distributed
    Provider will show up on the DRM Plus Extract.
 
 B. A new Cover Page is available with patient demographic and recent 
    dental activity information. Access to edit eligibility information 
    on this screen will be assigned by the dental administrator.
 
 C. DRM Plus will synchronize planned and completed care.  If exact
    duplicates are found between planned items and newly entered 
    completed items (if, for example, the user enters new items rather 
    than completing the existing planned item) then the planned items 
    will be automatically deleted.  Potential duplicates matching a 
    tooth# will be presented to the user so that the user may decide 
    which item(s) to keep or delete.
 
 D. Added a "Save &amp; Exit" button to the sequencing screen.  Users may 
    add or modify the treatment plan and file the changes without having
    to click "Next" through the other screens.  There must be no 
    Completed transactions, Perio, PSR, or Head and Neck data and the 
    most recent dental encounter must be Active for this feature to work.
 
 E. Added an "Edentulous" button to diagnostic findings.  Clicking 
    Edentulous and then clicking a tooth will mark all teeth in that 
    arch as missing and create the associated transactions.
 
 F. Ancillary applications or websites may be defined by the dental 
    administrator to launch via the DRM Plus Tools menu.  This is similar
    to how DRM Plus and other applications are launched from the CPRS 
    Tools menu.
 
 G. There are 4 new reports in DRM Plus.  The Patient Visit List shows a 
    list of visits for a selected patient (does not have to be the 
    current patient).  The Planned Items List contains the same data as
    the Provider Planning report, but the columns are sortable and can be
    subtotaled.  The Active Patients by Provider report shows a list of 
    all dental patients, by provider whose last encounter was active.  
    The Unfiled Data by Provider report shows a list of all patient's for
    which the provider has saved temporary "unfiled" data.
 
 H. Users may be prompted to complete the episode of care if they are 
    filing data and there are no remaining planned items for the patient
    and the status is Active.
 
 I. Dental Administrators may set a new parameter to not allow creation
    of PCE visits "on the fly".  This means that the user must select 
    an existing visit or scheduled appointment from the list before
    filing dental data.
 
 J. Small buttons were added to ADA Codes box and Multi-add box which 
    allows it to be moved to the other side of the mouth to view the 
    graphics beneath.
      
 K. Missing teeth will be visually indicated in the multi-tooth selection
    box by changing the buttons for missing teeth to white text on blue 
    background.  The missing teeth may still be selected if needed for
    the procedure code (e.g. implants, etc).
 
 L. Allow edit of unfiled H&amp;N items.  Do not add new items if the current
    item is unfiled.  This allows a user to modify the H&amp;N text in the 
    same session, rather than creating additional detail records.
 
 M. Display H&amp;N progress records on primary grid.  Add column containing 
    "Initial" or "Progress". This allows the user to view all H&amp;N entries
    on the primary screen.
   
      
 FIXES TO THE DRM Plus APPLICATION
 =======================================================================
 1. Head and Neck data will be filed to the correct provider when the 
    user files all data to another provider.
 
 2. The warning message that a Location must be entered has been removed
    for most cases.  Location is required on the second page of DRM Plus
    anyway, it did not need to be forced at application runtime.
 
 3. The VA Intranet Website location has been updated.  This site 
    contains information for VA dental users, including updates to DRM 
    Plus user manuals.
 
 4. Test patients and "extra" partial transactions will not appear in 
    the DRM Plus extract.
 
 5. If an Additional Signer is entered for one patient, and a note is 
    entered and signed from the Clinical Record tab for the next 
    patient, the additional signer will not carry over to the next 
    patient.
 
 6. If a previous Head &amp; Neck entry is deleted and a new entry is created 
    in the same session, the new entry will be created correctly, rather 
    than being created as a deleted record.
 
 7. The code boilerplate from TIU was putting an additional text marker 
    into the DRM Plus note.  When two text markers are present and the 
    user clicks 'Back' and 'Next' the note was being duplicated
    exponentially.  The second text marker has been removed and this 
    will no longer occur.
 
 8. Users without an 8 digit provider Id may run reports without seeing 
    a list-out-of-bounds error message.
 
 9. If the user had selected a tab, other than the Chart/Treatment tab 
    as the initial tab, a run time error was generated when changing 
    patients from CPRS.  Any tab can be selected as the initial tab
    (including the new Cover Page) without generating a runtime error 
    when changing patients.
 
 10. "Observe" type transactions will appear in the progress note when
     entered from the Completed tab. This type of transaction will 
     always appear under the Other Dental Findings heading.
 
 11. Markers on a surface "m" will now be removed when adding a retained
     root to the tooth.
 
 12. When adding a retained root to a crown, the crown will be removed.
     Prevent whole tooth extraction on a tooth with retained roots.
 
 13. Corrected the tooltip text (hover help) for the "Add Sub-Phase" 
     button on the sequencing screen.
 
 14. The tooth selection box will be cleared for multi-add when using 
     quick list or local codes.
 
 15. Corrected advance of MGJ on the perio screen.
 
 16. PSR data will be cleared when changing patients.  This will prevent
     PSR data from the previous patient displaying incorrectly.
     
 17. Corrected problem with the asterisks on the notes button not 
     appearing in certain scenarios.
 
 18. If the perio "clear" function results in an impacted tooth showing 
     at tooth #1, then the auto-advance did not work properly.  This has 
     been fixed.
 
 19. Changed planned extraction to remove M/D lesions.
 
 20. Corrected the jumbled view of multi-tooth when selecting a non-
     multi-tooth code.
 
 21. When adding a coping or crown on top of an existing implant by using
     the ADA Codes or Add text box, the graphics did not draw 
     appropriately.  The graphic will now display correctly.
 
 22. When DRM changes patients, return to the default view.
 
 23. The perio "Compare" button will now be enabled when there are two
     exams to compare.
 
 24. Removed accelerator keys from H&amp;N, Sequencing, PSR and Plaque 
     Index screens.
 
 25. Changed display of planned graphics to always apply planned items 
     after any diagnostic findings or completed items regardless of date.
     This may result in planned items not showing correctly in some cases.
 
 26. If you mark as missing a root on a bridge abutment and then try to
     remove the bridge by clicking missing and then the pontic, the 
     extract bridge popup does not show and only the pontic is removed,
     leaving the bar in place.  This has been fixed.
 
 27. Add retained root, then planned extract root, implant, coping, 
     crown.  After that, the already pressed restore button does not 
     work on any teeth.  This has been fixed.
 
 28. Don't save the sequencing note if it has not changed.
 
 29. CCOW will be defaulted OFF, or disabled.  In order to enable it, IRM
     must add a CCOW=ON parameter to the CPRS Tools menu string for DRM 
     Plus.  (CCOW=1 will also enable CCOW.)
      
 30. Admin users may no longer "re-add" nationally mapped CPT codes to 
     the ADA Mapping table which allowed them to modify the RVU and 
     VA-DSS product line information.
 
 31. Quick codes that are DRM Plus "ranged" codes (used in bridges for
     example) can now be removed from the user's Quick List.  This
     affected sites as they were migrating to DRM Plus from DRM.
 
 32. A single diagnosis is pre-selected as the Primary PCE Diagnosis.
     This will work when there is a single diagnosis entry on the filing
     options page, or when there are multiple entries as long as they are
     all the same diagnosis code.
     
 33. A list-out-of-bounds error will no longer occur trying to create the
     progress note under certain (infrequent) circumstances when the user
     clicks back and next, deleting and adding transactions many times.
    
 34. The Print button on the File menu will only work for 'Notes' on the 
     Clinical Record tab.  The other types of entries (Meds, Consults, 
     Vitals, etc) cannot be printed from DRM Plus.
 
 35. Diagnostic Findings older than the 1 day that are deleted by an 
     admin user will be removed from the graphic and the transaction 
     list.  These were previously shown in the transaction list with a 
     strike-through as if a non-admin user had deleted them.     
     
 36. Partials that were modified or deleted in the sequencing screen
     displayed incorrectly in the progress note.  They were showing 
     entries for each tooth in the partial rather than a single entry.
 
 37. The Visit Date will be used in the transaction list rather than the
     date the item was created.  This is a more relevant date to the user.
     
      
 SYSTEM ACCESS DURING INSTALLATION
 ========================================================================
 Installation of this patch does not require users to be off of the 
 system. However,  all Dental users should not use the DRM Plus GUI
 while the patch is being installed.  All Dental users MUST close any 
 open DRM Plus GUI application prior to the patch being installed.  Once 
 the patch has completed the users can use the DRM Plus application.
 
 
 POST-INSTALLATION PROCESS
 =======================================================================
 The post-installation will change the D6056 ada code to 'Coping' for
 the correct DRM Plus graphics, will set a default for the new 
 DENTV DRM NO VISIT CREATE and DENTV DRM DUPCHECK OFF parameters and 
 will add 1 to each entry defined in the DENTV DRM DEF STARTUP TAB 
 parameter because there's a new tab zero (0) for the Cover Page. 
 
 The post-installation will also start a TaskMan job to loop through 
 all the Dental History entries (228.1) for each Dental Patient (220)
 and inactivate (set DAS DISPOSITION=Completed) the last encounter if 
 the status is 'In Progress' and date is &gt; 2 years (730 days).

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR DENT*1.2*47
 ======================================================================
 This patch must be installed when there are no dental DRM processes
 running.  All open DRM Plus GUI applications must be closed.
 
 The installation time should take less than 2 minutes.
   
 1. Obtain the Dent_1_2P47.kid file
 
 2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
    the Installation menu
 
 3. Use Load a Distribution and enter Dent_1_2P47.kid when prompted
    for a Host file.  You may need to attach a directory name
 
 4. You may elect to use the following options (when prompted for 
    INSTALL NAME, enter DENT*1.2*47)
    a. Backup a Transport Global
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global
 
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select package DENT*1.2*47
 
 6. For the install prompts, enter either Yes or No depending upon the
    normal practice at your facility.  This example shows answering NO:
 
 Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES// NO
 Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES// NO
 Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? YES// NO
 
 =======================================================================
                        POST-INSTALLATION PROCESS
 =======================================================================
 1. Move dentalmrmtx.exe to   ...\DOCSTORE
      '...\' indicates your path for where DRM Plus is located.
 
    Run setupP47.EXE on all Windows Workstations, Thin Client Servers, 
    Windows Terminal Services Servers and Citrix Servers that need to 
    launch the dentalmrmtx.exe you moved to \DOCSTORE.  SetupP47.exe does
    NOT need to be run on the machine that hosts the \DOCSTORE folder.
    
    We recommend that setupP47.EXE be run by an administrator. 
    SetupP47.EXE replaces the CVision.ocx file (and other files) in
    C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32 and registers it on the machine.  The version
    of CVision.ocx (found by right-clicking the .ocx and selecting 
    Properties option, Version tab) is 2.2.0.14.
    
    Note: On some Windows Server machines the setupP47.EXE file 
    will not update the CVision.ocx file in WINNT\SYSTEM32.
    If the version is not 2.2.0.14 then Micorsoft's Data Execution
    Prevention (DEP) may be the issue.  Turn DEP off (call DSS tech
    support if you need help with this), reboot the machine and install
    the client side files by running setupP47.EXE. Additional information
    on Microsoft's DEP can be found at: 
    http://support.microsoft.com/kb/875352
        
    *********************************************************************
    Please be careful to coordinate the server/client updates with each 
    other so that the dental application works properly.  You will know 
    if the server/client files are *NOT* compatible because launching DRM 
    Plus will cause approximately 30 client errors!  This also means that
    you must carefully coordinate testing the new application in the TEST
    account since you must run setupP47.exe on a rarely used machine for 
    the dental staff to test against, as they will not be able to run the
    production side application after updating the client.
    *********************************************************************
    
 2. Once the patch is released, the Patch 47 User Manual and 
    Administrative Manual will be available are available on the DRM Plus
    intranet site: http://vaww1.domain.ext/dental/ under the DRM Plus
    link found on the left side of the main page, then DRM Plus Resources
    found at the bottom of the page.  
    The documents are titled:
