<dt>DESCRIPTION OF ENHANCEMENTS:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
For the Outpatient &amp; IV statistics, the number of Social Security numbers
for each drug is extracted.
 
Consolidated Mail Out Pharmacy (CMOP) data is extracted from Host CMOP
facilities.
 
Procurement and Controlled Substances data is now extracted.
 
After the monthly D&amp;PPM report is sent to the D&amp;PPM Section, 
a confirmation MailMan message will be generated at the facility
providing information about the number of drugs extracted for
each package.

This patch addresses NOISs CHA-0296-31865 and NYN-1295-11103. It was
reported that when the D&amp;PPM software is collecting the Outpatient
Pharmacy data, an endless loop can occur when collecting data from
partials. The problem was an incorrect $Select statement which repeatedly
looped on the first node.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Problems resolved with this patch:
 
1. The XM mailer hung in the background looking for user input. Modules
needing to send more than one detailed message to Hines for a division
were getting hung in the background. The XMY array needed to be recreated
for each subsequent message.
 
NOIS:
RIC-1198-20912
HIN-1198-41911
NTH-0199-72479
TAM-0299-30835
 
Resolution:
The XMY array is now properly reset providing the address for the
subsequent messages.
 
2. Unit Dose generates an allocation error. The PSUTA array used in the
unit dose extract grows too large for the local partition.
 
NOIS:
ALX-1298-71646
DEN-0199-51099
BED-0299-11199
 
Resolution:
The PSUTA array has been moved to the ^TMP global.
 
3. Procurement generates an allocation error. The PSUMIT array grows too
large for the local partition.
 
NOIS:
IOW-1198-40646
 
Resolution:
The PSUMIT array has been moved to the ^TMP global.
 
4. The procurement module has cost calculation and dividing by zero
errors.
The procurement costing equation was wrong and there were cases when one
of the cost-per-unit factors used in the calculations were not available
and zero was being used for division.
 
NOIS:
NYN-1298-10759
 
Resolution:
The formulas for costing factors have been amended. In cases
where the cost factors are not available the reports have been amended
to reflect null or NA in the reports.
 
5. The outpatient extracts shows the wrong division in the message
headers. The software was pulling division names from File #40.8 instead
of File #59.
 
NOIS:
IOW-0199-41095
 
Resolution:
Routines PSUOP4, PSUOP6 have been modified to pull division names from
File #59.
 
6. Division names for AR/WS, Procurement, and CS in the headers are not
matching the facility numbers. The coded lookup from File #40.8 is pulling
up entries associated with IENs instead of facility numbers.
 
NOIS:
CTX-1198-71660
MON-1298-52507
POR-0199-52307
 
Resolution:
The existence of a .001 field allows the pulling up of names by IEN
numbers. The lookups for names by facility number is now coded to limit
the search to the 'C' cross-reference only.
 
7. The AR/WS extract is generating subscript errors at DIV+6^PSUAR1. There
are inpatient locations that may not be linked to the PHARMACY AOU STOCK
file (#58.1).
 
NOIS:
MON-1198-50086
CLA-1298-20491
CHA-0199-30249
 
Resolution:
The coding in PSUAR1 has been modified to accommodate cases where
inpatient locations are not linked within the PHARMACY AOU Stock File
(#58.1).
 
8. The PSUARNM array is growing too large for the local partition in the
AR/WS extract and generates allocation errors.
 
NOIS:
OKL-1198-70175
 
Resolution:
The PSUARNM array has been moved to ^TMP for storage and processing in
routine PSUAR4.
 
9. Some Mail message headers showing a 'null' user identity. The variable
XMDUZ was not being reset for subsequent messages.
 
Resolution:
The variable XMDUZ is set for each message generated.
 
10. IV statistics are wrong. A mix of calculation variables being used
were wrong.
 
Resolution:
The proper variables were identified and calculations re-coded.
 
11. The Controlled Substance Statistical Data report columns need to be
better aligned and the footnotes "* Non-Formulary" and "# Not on National
Formulary"" are missing.
 
Resolution:
The Controlled Substance Statistical Data report has been modified.
 
12. The Controlled Substance extract errors out when a type 2 transaction
has a quantity = 0.
 
NOIS:
MUR-0199-31080
 
Resolution:
The logic has been modified to quit the transmission of a record when the
quantity = 0.
 
13. The procurement extract was building lines in the MailMan messages
that were exceeding MailMan acceptable parameters.
 
NOIS:
LON-1198-60747
LEB-0299-20160
 
Resolution:
The length of the description of items contained in the extract have been
limited to 50 characters.
 
14. Undefined variable error in the procurement extract was generated due
to data arrays not being initialized properly.
 
NOIS:
EKH-0199-42100
NAS-0299-30308
WPB-0299-31308
 
Resolution:
The data arrays are properly initialized.
 
15. Controlled Substance reports are improperly flagging formulary drugs
as non-formulary.
 
NOIS:
MAR-0299-21304
 
Resolution:
The logic for flagging the formulary status has been corrected.
 
16. The AR extracts would send out multiple detailed messages whose
contents were duplicates. This was caused by the array holding the data
not being initialized properly.
 
NOIS:
HIN-0199-41269
 
Resolution:
The code has been modified to properly initialize the data array.
 
17. The costing formula in the procurement extract includes a $J function
which failed when the parameters of the formula were modified. The formula
was proper but the calculation was then too complex for the $J function.
 
NOIS:
CAH-1298-30287
 
Resolution:
The code was changed to perform the calculation first outside of the $J
function and then hand the result to the $J function.

The division indicator is set to the default facility ID when no data is
found for transmission.
 
NOIS:
ISH-0399-40149
 
3. The IV extract was using a logic test incorrectly and the formulary
flag indicator was not being set properly for extraction.
 
Resolution:
The logic statement being used has been corrected.
 
NOIS:
MAR-0399-20146
 
4. Some quantity fields have alpha suffixes which needed to be removed
prior to being entered into the data export.

The quantity fields now have all alpha suffixes removed prior to message
construction.

1. Problem: 
 
The GETM^PSUTL API pulls all data fields within a specified multiple. This
may lead to generation of allocation errors and makes DBIA tracking
difficult.
 
Resolution:
 
The GETM^PSUTL was modified to require the itemizing of fields to be
pulled and returns only the fields specified from the multiple identified.
 
2. Problem:
 
The automatic completion checker is falsely reporting incomplete runs. It
is scheduled to run 24 hours after the extract has started. Large sites
are seeing extracts that are taking more than 24 hours. 
 
Resolution:
 
The automatic completion checker is now scheduled to run 72 hours after
the start of the extract.
 
3. Problem:
 
The procurement extract for File #58.8 DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY STATS is
looking for IV rooms in the wrong file.

This patch contains modifications to the Pharmacy Benefits Management 
package.
 
1. The Patient Demographics extract will transmit new Ethnicity and 
multiple Race fields.  The new fields comply with the new Race and 
Ethnicity Standards as set forth by the Office of Management and Budget.
 
Old race information will continue to be extracted when it is present.  
New ethnicity and race information will be extracted as it is available.
 
 
2. This patch also corrects the following problem:  Sites that are not 
using the Surgery package receive a "missing routine" error
because the PBM extract incorrectly makes a call to a supported Surgery 
API.
 
Solution:  The code is altered to omit reference to the Surgery API, and 
replaces it with a call appropriate to PBM.

Problem 1:
 
For the Manual Pharmacy Statistics [PSU PBM MANUAL] option, the date range
for the February extract does not distinguish leap years from non-leap
years.  The end date for the February extract on all reports other than 
the Timing and Confirmation messages is always recorded as February 
29, regardless of whether it is a leap year or not.
 
In addition, on the PBM Timing and Confirmation messages, February
29 is not recognized as a legitimate end date for the February extract in
non-leap years.  Therefore the end date defaults to the start date and the
date range displays as February 1 to February 1.
 
Resolution 1:
 
The code for the Manual Pharmacy Statistics [PSU PBM MANUAL] 
option is altered to take leap years into account so that the correct 
February date range is displayed on all PBM messages.
 
 
Problem 2:
 
At some facilities the Mailman message subject header on the PBM 
Messages displays only the facility/division number, and does not 
display the name of the facility/division.
 
Resolution 2:
 
There are two possible solutions to this problem.  (1) Some sites have
assigned more than one division name to a division number in file 
#40.8.  In these instances, a user at the site should correct the file
definitions so that only one division name is assigned to one division 
number.  (2) The code is altered to correct missing division names on 
the message headers when the problem is not user error.

This patch contains modifications to the Pharmacy Benefits Management 
(PBM) package.
 
Problem:  When the monthly Prescription extract runs, an error occurs in
the prescription patient demographics report if social security numbers 
are missing on patients included in the extract.
 
Solution:  Code has been altered to omit patients from the prescription 
patient demographics report if social security numbers are missing.  This 
prevents an error from occurring.

This patch makes a correction in the Pharmacy Benefits Management Provider
extract summary report.  It removes providers from the summary report who
have erroneous missing data.
 
1.  Problem:  At teaching hospitals, interns and residents are reported as
having missing subspecialties on the Provider extract summary report.  
This
is incorrect, since by definition interns and residents never have
subspecialties.  Therefore these should be removed from the report.
 
Solution:  If any of the following provider classifications are listed as
missing a subspecialty only, they are omitted from the Provider summary
report.
        Resident - Allopathic
        Resident - Osteopathic
        Intern   - Allopathic
        Intern   - Osteopathic

PHASE II of the TRANSITIONAL PHARMACY BENEFIT project requires a new 
category to be added to each of the set of codes for the Prescription 
Patient Status and the Provider Type elements of the outpatient 
prescription transmission of the Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) 
extracts.
 
The new element added to each set of codes is "NVA", which stands for 
NoN-VA.
 
If a prescription in the PRESCRIPTION file #52 has a TPB RX status of 
"YES", both the Prescription Patient Status and the Provider Type 
elements in the transmission will be set to "NVA".

 Phase I of the Inpatient Medications Requirements for the Special Focus
 Group IRA project consists of four patches. The patches are combined in
 host file PSJ_PSS_OR_PSU_110.KID in order to simplify installation at VHA
 facilities. Installation of this host file should be coordinated among
 the four packages affected since only one installation is necessary. The
 patches, in order of install, are:
 
      PSS*1*79   PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT V. 1.0
      PSJ*5*110  INPATIENT MEDICATIONS V. 5.0
      OR*3*213   ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING V. 1.0
      PSU*3*34   PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGEMENT V. 3.0
 
 Patches PSS*1*79, OR*3*213, and PSU*3*34 contain changes to support the
 following enhancements in PSJ*5*110:
 
 1. The Extend Stop Date on Renewal enhancements will allow an order to be
 renewed without creating a new order. Editing of the start date will no
 longer be allowed during the renewal process. In addition, limits have
 been set on the length of time after an order expires that it may be
 renewed. This is outlined in the BCMA 2001 Special Focus Report,
 Requirement #11.
 
 2. The Complex Order enhancements will change the way complex orders are
 handled by linking complex components (child orders) together. If the
 actions Finish, Verify, Discontinue, or Renew are taken on one child
 order, the user will be alerted that the action must be taken on all of
 the complex component orders in the set. The user will then be prompted
 to take the appropriate action on each child order in the complex order
 set. This is outlined in BCMA 2001 Special Focus Report, Requirement #8.
  
 3. The STAT and NOW Order Notification enhancements will alert users
 subscribing to new mail group PSJ STAT NOW PENDING ORDER when a pending
 STAT or NOW order has been received from Computerized Patient Record
 System (CPRS) V. 1.0. Users subscribing to the new mail group PSJ STAT
 NOW ACTIVE ORDER will receive an alert when a STAT or NOW order is made
 active. This is outlined in BCMA 2001 Special Focus Report, Requirement
 #12.
 
 Changes to PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGEMENT (PBM) V. 3.0 have been included
 in this patch to address the following issues:
 
 1. Problem:  The changes to renewed orders introduced by the Inpatient
 Medications Requirements for the Special Focus Group IRA, Phase I project
 will allow renewed orders to have an active status for periods of time
 that exceed the current PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGEMENT (PBM) V. 3.0 time
 period parameters.
 
 Solution:  The code searching for IV and Unit Dose activity within the
 transmitting period has been modified to accommodate the extended periods
 of time orders may contain an active status as a result of the changes
 introduced by the Inpatient Medications Requirements for the Special 
 Focus Group IRA, Phase I project.
 
 2. Problem: In several extracts only the first portion of the patient
 Integration Control Number is being extracted. The entire Integration
 Control Number needs to be exported.
 
 Solution: Patch PSU*3*34 will correct and extract the entire Integration
 Control Number in the IV multiple (#100) in the Pharmacy Patient file
 (#55) and the UNIT DOSE multiple (#62) in the Pharmacy Patient file
 (#55).
 
 Patch PSU*3*24 will correct the problem in all other applicable files.
 This is being done so that patch 24 and 34 can move forward without
 conflict.

The Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Extract Enhancement III project 
provides enhancements to send all chemistry lab test results to the 
Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) National Server.  These 
results are sent via Health Level 7 (HL7) messages using the Health Level 
Seven Optimized (HLO) messaging service.  
 
This patch includes an environmental check routine. The preinstallation 
steps require the logical link, PSU SEND, to be defined correctly. It 
checks to see if it is unfurling within a test area or a live area and if
the link is configured incorrectly, the installation lists what is wrong 
with the link and then aborts.  The IRM can troubleshoot the link and run 
the installation of PSU*4*3 once he has the link defined as specified.
 
This patch also includes the listening software employed at the CMOP-NAT
server. It is routines PSULRHL2 &amp; PSULRHL3. NEITHER OF THESE ROUTINES 
SHOULD BE USED AT SITES.  These should only be deployed on the CMOP-NAT
server for PBM.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
This patch addresses a request which support the Pharmacy Benefits
Management (PBM) Extracts Enhancement #3 project. In order to allow the
retransmission of only those patients who have had demographic updates,
Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0, Inpatient Medications V. 5.0, Registration
v. 5.3 and Pharmacy Data Management V. 1.0 were modified to build an entry
for re-transmission in PBM PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS File #59.9.
 
The following issues are addressed in this patch:
1. The logic in routine PSUHL was corrected so that when an edit is made
to the RACE INFORMATION field #2 or ETHNICITY INFORMATION field #6 in
the PATIENT File #2, an entry is queued in the PBM PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS
File #59.9. Currently, because of flawed logic when edits are made to
either of these two fields, an entry is not queued.
 
The integration agreement #4803 was added to record the usage of routine
PSUHL by other packages.
 
 
2. The Automatic Pharmacy Statistics [PSU PBM AUTO] report generated a
&lt;SUSBCRIPT&gt; error condition. This error was created when the report was
run before any monthly data was filed. Routine PSUHL was modified to quit
the FOR loop at line tag CLEANUP when the DAY variable is NULL.
 

3. Sites reported getting &lt;STORE&gt;SETDPT+9^DPTLK1 errors which was traced
to the protocol PSU PATIENT DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE called by the DG FIELD
MONITOR protocol. Line tag LOGDFN was changed to use the DBS call
UPDATE^DIE instead of the Fileman call FILE^DICN.
 
4. During internal testing, a problem was discovered with the handling
of local data elements in routine PSUHL. The killing of those variables
presents the potential for problems later in other areas. This patch
corrects the way in which these variables are handled.

<dt>DESCRIPTION:  &nbsp;&nbsp;<pre>
Currently, the Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) extract blocks the
transmission of chemistry lab results for "Employee Veteran" and
"Employee Non-Veteran." This patch addresses the New Service Request (NSR)
#20080810 to transmit the chemistry lab results for "Employee Veteran"
via Health Level 7 (HL7) messaging to the PBM extract database while
continuing to block the chemistry lab results for "Employee Non-Veteran."
 
This patch also addresses the following.
 
Problem:
========
Several facilities were reporting that selected laboratory tests were not
present in the Structured Query Language (SQL) database used by PBM to
perform medication use safety surveillance, while the source data was
clearly available in local VistA and Computerized Patient Record
System (CPRS). Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the
laboratory results did transmit as expected, but the lab test name did
not, resulting in database search failures.
 
Resolution:
===========
The source of the error was traced to laboratory tests with a National
Lab Test (NLT) Name containing a tilde (~) character. This character
is also used as the delimiter in HL7 message processing, and the extra
tilde caused the routines that parse the transmitted data to be offset by
one data element. The correction is to translate any tilde characters in
the NLT name into an underscore (_) character, so that any remaining
tilde characters are solely present as the expected HL7 delimiters.
