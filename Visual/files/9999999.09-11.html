<td>EDUCATIONAL OUTCOME</td>
<td><pre>
This topic represents the inquiry process done by a clinician to determine
if the patient should receive Exercise education. This topic was created
as an example of a screening topic that could be used on an Encounter
Form, for check-off by the clinician.
 
Clinicians at sites will be required to document activity related to
the "Fitness and Exercise Screening" PCE reminder, or your local sites
equivalent. The "Fitness and Exercise Screening" reminder was defined
by the National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention
(NCHP). The data collected in PCE reflecting activity related to the
Fitness and Exercise Screening reminder, or your local sites equivalent,
will be used by the National Center for Health Promotion and Disease
Prevention in preparation of an annual report to Congress.
 
This screening topic is considered the "minimum" requirement for
clinicians to reflect the clinical activity.  If the clinician actually
provides education, the appropriate Education topic should be recorded,
reflecting the education given.

<tr>
<td>EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS</td>
<td><pre>
This standard is actually a guideline.  Clinicians could use this
guideline as an example of the type of questions to ask the patient when
the clinician needs to determine whether the patient should receive
Exercise education.
 
Ask the patient to describe his or her usual exercise patterns in general,
and also in particular ask how many days per week the person engages in at
least moderate physical exercise like brisk walking for 30 minutes or
more.  Moderate physical exercise of 30 minutes or more three times a week
is optimal; less often may be a trigger for counseling.
