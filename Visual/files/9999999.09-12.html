<td>EDUCATIONAL OUTCOME</td>
<td><pre>
This topic represents the inquiry process done by a clinician to
determine if the patient should receive Nutrition/Weight education. This
topic was created as an example of a screening topic that could be used on
an EncounterForm, for check-off by the clinician.
 
Clinicians at sites will be required to document activity related to the
"Weight and Nutrition Screening" PCE reminder, or your local sites
equivalent. The "Weight and Nutrition Screening" reminder was defined by
the National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCHP).
The data collected in PCE reflecting activity related to the Weight and
Nutrition Screening reminder, or your local sites equivalent, will be used
by the National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention in
preparation of an annual report to Congress.
 
This screening topic is considered the "minimum" requirement
for clinicians to reflect the clinical activity.  If the clinician
actually provides education, the appropriate Education topic should be
recorded, reflecting the education given.

<tr>
<td>EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS</td>
<td><pre>
This standard is actually a guideline.  Clinicians could use this
guideline as an example of the type of questions to ask the patient when
the clinician needs to determine whether the patient should receive
Nutrition/Weight education.
 
Ask the patient to describe his or her usual dietary intake, eating
habits, and snacking patterns.  Discuss the importance of restricting fat
(particularly saturated fat) intake and the benefits of high fiber diets.
For those overweight, discuss the value of reduced caloric intake.
Excessive weight may be a trigger for nutrition counseling.
