<td>EDUCATIONAL OUTCOME</td>
<td><pre>
This topic represents the inquiry process done by a clinician to determine
if the patient should receive Seat Belt Use education. This topic was
created as an example of a screening topic that could be used on an
Encounter Form, for check-off by the clinician.
 
Clinicians at sites will be required to document activity related the
"Seatbelt and Accident Screening" PCE reminder, or your local sites
equivalent. The "Seatbelt and Accident Screening" reminder was defined
by the National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCHP).
The data collected in PCE reflecting activity related to the Sealtbelt and
Accident Screening reminder, or your local sites equivalent, will be
used by the National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention
in preparation of an annual report to Congress.
 
This screening topic is considered the "minimum" requirement for
clinicians to reflect the clinical activity.  If the clinician actually
provides education, the appropriate Education topic should be recorded,
reflecting the education given.
 
The goal of this screening is to identify whether the patient needs
education for seatbelt use and accident avoidance.

<tr>
<td>EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS</td>
<td><pre>
This standard is actually a guideline.  Clinicians could use this
guideline as an example of the type of questions to ask the patient when
the clinician needs to determine whether the patient should receive
Seatbelt Use education.
 
Ask the patient if he or she usually use a seatbelt when driving or riding
in an automobile, and if he or she usually wears a helmet when bicycling
or riding a motorcycle.  Provide education as appropriate.
