<td>EDUCATIONAL OUTCOME</td>
<td><pre>
This topic represents the inquiry process done by a clinician to determine
if the patient should receive Tobacco Use education. This topic was
created as an example of a screening topic that could be used on an
Encounter Form, for check-off by the clinician. 
 
Clinicians at sites will be required to document activity related to the
"Tobacco Use Screening" PCE reminder, or your local sites equivalent. The
"Tobacco Use Screening" reminder was defined by the National Center for
Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCHP). The data collected in PCE
reflecting activity related to the Tobacco Use Screening reminder, or your
local sites equivalent, will be used by the National Center for Health
Promotion and Disease Prevention in preparation of an annual report to
Congress.
 
This screening topic is considered the "minimum" requirement for
clinicians to reflect the clinical activity.  If the clinician actually
provides education, the appropriate Education topic should be recorded,
reflecting the education given.

<tr>
<td>EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS</td>
<td><pre>
This standard is actually a guideline.  Clinicians could use this
guideline as an example of the type of questions to ask the patient when
the clinician needs to determine whether the patient should receive
Tobacco Use (Smoking) education.
 
Ask the patient if he or she currently smokes cigarettes or chews tobacco
on a regular basis.  If not, ask if he or she ever did and how many years
since the person has used tobacco regularly.  Current use of tobacco may
be a trigger for tobacco use education.
