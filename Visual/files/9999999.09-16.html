Patients with HTN should receive counseling on the following nutritional
modifications:
 
1.      WEIGHT REDUCTION:  Overweight patients should reduce their weight
to within 10 percent of their ideal body weight. However, reduction even
of 5 to 10 pounds can be helpful in controlling HTN.
 
2.      ALCOHOL INTAKE:  Alcohol intake should be limited to no more than
one ounce (24 ounces of beer; or 10 ounces of wine; or 2 ounces of
100-proof whiskey) per day for men or 0.5 ounces of alcohol per day for
women and for lighter weight men.
 
3.      SODIUM INTAKE:  Sodium intake in the patient with HTN should be
limited to no more than 100 mmol/day (2.4 g of sodium or 6 g of sodium
chloride).
 
4.      DIET:  An adequate dietary intake of potassium, calcium, and
magnesium can be obtained from fresh fruits and vegetables. Other dietary
advice should include a heart-healthy diet such as the DASH Diet. This is
one means of satisfying the dietary steps above. See the DASH Diet table
below.
 
5.      HYPERLIPIDEMIA:  Counsel to reduce intake of dietary saturated
fats and cholesterol. A diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables as well
as low in dietary saturated fats and cholesterol is also beneficial in
lowering blood pressure.
