<td>EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS</td>
<td><pre>
This standard is actually a guideline.  Clinicians could use this
guideline as an example of the type of questions to ask the patient when
the clinician needs to determine whether the patient should receive
Advance Directives education.
 
Ask the patient if he or she has ever discussed his or her wishes
concerning aggressive medical care during the end of life or a persistent
vegetative state, and if these discussions have even been made formal in
any signed document.
